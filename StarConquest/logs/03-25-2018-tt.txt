Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed
here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Strange hulks of alien origin litter this region of space, from unrecognizable
slag that was never any human design and oddly shaped metal plating to
glittering metal devices whose purposes are unknown.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the
launch tube, then deployed.

The starship has left a unique area of space.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
[PA] Blake Madison: "Yep."

The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.

dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.

Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.
The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct
hits.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.
The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey
reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey,
before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.
The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.
The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Will you be up for awhile? No one seems to be alive at the
moment."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "And I need some sleep, whew."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "I'm kind of half in half out. May want to stop the ship if
you're concerned. I'll be up more fully in about 3 hours or so."

[PA] Simon Collins: "If noone's awake I can watch it."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "That works, Simon."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "I can rouse myself if we run into any problems."
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing
that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless
desert plain is all around.
Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.
A small vehicle pulls alongside, kicking up dust, before speeding ahead.
A truck on a converging path swings onto the main road just ahead of the ship.

godda start shoveling?"

A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through
into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place
isn't right.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "I want to find a pre-stellar or similar object before we use
the burner."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "The idea being that we'll refuel, then restock the hold
while we're there."
[PA] Simon Collins: "I have the con for the time being then."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "With stuff that burns well."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Alrighty!"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Oh, an oort would also be alright if we can find comets.
Think water's okay for fusion, too."

This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world
below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you
can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that

status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.

A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startlingly like a single
unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass
is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a
glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created
here.

a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares
into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive
squid propels itself away from the starship.
The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.
The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of
brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked,
"GO!"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
The ship lands on a square marked "Roll Again!" Dice roll, and the ship advances
another few squares.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "ALLO!"
[PA] Blake Madison: "Hello."
[PA] Matteo Hapta: "Hi."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
You hear dice roll. A moment later, a giant hand descends and advances the ship
several spaces.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.
[PA] Blake Madison: "Keegan can you get the first-aid kit from the head?"
You hear dice roll. A moment later, a giant hand descends and advances the ship
several spaces, moving it past an alien-looking starship gamepiece.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.
You hear dice roll. A moment later, a giant hand descends and advances the ship
several spaces.
Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the
entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.
Listen. You need to be careful.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Ryan eat clarina in the shower."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Oh dear."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "I'm using your shower, keegan."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Alas, alack."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "There's one next to the cryopods, too."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "This one is less creepy."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Clari is my soap in my shower?"
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "No?"
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Why are you asking me if I've done cryo...things.."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "I have sopa though."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Ryan needs some."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Too."
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "I could use it. This crap clings."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "Uh, one moment, or ten."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "So um, come to the food place."
The hovertrailer carrying you fishtails briefly.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes
close slowly and it appears to sleep.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Straight up from the base block."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "And no, not single use."

[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "I'm okay now. But I'm not doing that fucking shit again."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "Righto."
A hovercar spends several minutes overtaking you. Smooth, cycloptic faces peer
out its windows at you.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.
[PA] Ather Jammoa: "All of the stuff in the hold is pretty much worthless for
charging in a decent amount of time. You guys couldn't find those hydrogen
masses and the supernova stuff?"
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine
where they are coming from.
A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.
Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic
crater.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey
reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey,
before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.
The monkey drops down to a lower branch.
The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.
The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree
to another.
The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as
explanation.
The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.
The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The
scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
[PA] Ather Jammoa: "Oh dear."
A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of
the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.
[PA] Alko Delovega: "Hi."
Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at
the center.
The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the
landscape below.
Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at
the center.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly
emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the
dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Hmm?"
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Hmm!"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "HMMMMM!"
A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Trying to sleep and the rift thinks it's okay to put me in
the middle of a war with bombs, ugh."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Yes."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "It is rude."
[PA] Alko Delovega: "Don't remind me with bombers...."
A soldier pops above the trench and fires a few rounds from his rifle before
ducking back as the enemy returns fire.
An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left
leg is soaked in blood.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.
Lily Kaise glides in from the east.
Lily Kaise tugs a pair of soft dark pink slippers off of her feet.
Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered
with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all
directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the
depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

launch tube, then deployed.

that order?"
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "Yes."
[PA] Ather Jammoa: "Woo."

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey
reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey,
before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The
scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
Something suddenly spooks the horses. They begin charging down the path, their
eyes rolling in panic.
The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "Weeeee!"
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "Holey shit we're cruising."
A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to
swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

Listen. You need to be careful.

Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as
one, finding a new updraft.

The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

[PA] Keegan Wantz: "We're going uh."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Where this storm wants us to go."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Which is southwest and down."
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the
drain, obscuring your vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly
emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the
dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene
to formless mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "Thanks. You too, when you get there."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Uhh."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Expect drive repairs soon, we're getting zapped by the
storm."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Anyone alive?"
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding
you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through
billowing clouds.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Repair time."
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "External ones are done. We're in the eng."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Oh, damnation."
The horses cease their panic, and breathe hard as they resume a more normal
pace.
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.

The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
The storm moves off into the distance, and the wind dies down.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
The starship has arrived on the very limits of a solar system, the first point
where the local star's influence on gravity is anything more than negligible.
The star itself is merely a distant glinting point, indistinguishable from any
of the millions of distant but brighter stars also in view. This is an Oort
cloud, a massive sphere of captured comets, asteroids, and similar interstellar
flotsam.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate
that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early
indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to
possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Ooh."
The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the
launch tube, then deployed.

The blast chamber shuts down, having fully charged the starship.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly
emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the
dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.
Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for
protection.
The computer announces, "Incoming QE message from AFW Command."
A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock

bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

[PA] Keegan Wantz: "I just said that!"
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "We've also been rifting for uh...what is this uh...eight
hours?"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Almost twelve."
Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on
it.

[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Oh do we count the zero for the cycle thing?"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "2.I is uh, about two and eighteen of twenty five cycles."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "So just under twelve hours."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "So we've gone about 120 light-years in 12 hours, which is...
right on average, actually."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Assuming a ten light-year per hour average, which may be
inaccurate."
Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship,

The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to
mist.
The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of
brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked,
"GO!"
You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.
The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Flow's about to smack us in the face, alas, alack."
The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."
Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the
entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "Drive faster."
You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "I've never seen this riftscape before."
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "At least, it's more rare if I have."

The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Farewell people."
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "Um....."
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "Thanks Gonzales!"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Hm?"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Oh, socks."
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Of course!"
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "I just got a trenchcoat."
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "Thank you, Gonzales."
[PA] Ather Jammoa: "We are gloriously ungrateful."
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "I kind of like the trenchcoat. Little worn, but it's
comfortable."
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Oh my."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "What's up?"
The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Flow flow."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "Oh dear. I see what you mean."
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Well, flow's getting southwestish, so it'll get even
worse."
The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "No pictures. Got it."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "But honey. I think on the Gray expedition, they made me
wear a little sailor outfit for days."
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "I miss you, gonzales!"
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "Also, that was a good sandwich. Please remember where you
got it."

rather than starships."
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "Horsepower!"
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new

The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.
A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.
A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to
swirling mist.
The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you
from their seats.
You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.
You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.
You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.
Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness
gives way to swirling mist.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
The outcropping veers suddenly.
The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.
A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle
around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the
distance.
A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of
the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.
The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey
reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey,
before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.
The monkey tosses the ship to another monkey.
The monkey drops down to a lower branch.
The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.
[PA] Simon Collins: "If noone else is awake I'll be watching it."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Thank you!"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "If we have enough people awake, I'd like to shovel more of
the hydrogen in at the next find, think it's getting close to when we'll want to
flatten out then turn around."
[PA] Simon Collins: "Really want to start shoveling already? From what I read
here this should last us a few more days easily, but its tct so I'm probably
getting it horribly wrong."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Yeah, I want to turn around with a full battery and 50%
wear, more or less."
The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as
explanation.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "We didn't get the best speed out, but we might hit a calm on
the way back or some shit like that."
The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree
to another.

The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The
scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.
The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from
scored bark and snapped branches.
On the shore, a number of bodies are stretched out on burning sand as fire falls
from the sky.

[PA] Simon Collins: "Anyone awake who can help me do spectrography and immaging
things once we arrive at this place?"
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Sure."
[PA] Simon Collins: "Awesome."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "I can't but I'm up!"
[PA] Simon Collins: "It'll be a while before we get there, the rift is doing all
it can to make this a pain, so we'll have to sit tite."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "It's called, Death and realization? Or the computer has
labeled it this? How...emo."
[PA] Simon Collins: "Don't ask me."
[PA] Simon Collins: "Probably another alien graveyard."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "They wanted to be really bleak with it."
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding
you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through
billowing clouds.
The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.
Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on
it and goes to sleep.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally just shifting mists.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Strange hulks of alien origin litter this region of space, from unrecognizable
slag that was never any human design and oddly shaped metal plating to
glittering metal devices whose purposes are unknown.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Simon Collins: "Anyone awake?"
[PA] Tony Cross: "Yes."
The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the
launch tube, then deployed.
[PA] Matteo Hapta: "Yup."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A dark shape flits past the viewport.
[PA] Tony Cross: "Wow."
[PA] Matteo Hapta: "Is someone in the control room? I think that's a patrol
ship."
[PA] Simon Collins: "Na, the rift's fucking with ya."
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Nah."

A dark shape flits past the viewport.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
