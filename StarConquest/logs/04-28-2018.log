00:06 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm not."

00:07 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

00:07 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm here."

00:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:14 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:14 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:14 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:15 Listen. You need to be careful.

00:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

00:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

00:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

00:44 They talk about you when you are asleep, you know.

00:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

00:55 Don't let them trick you.

01:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

01:05 Do you know what they want?

01:15 Don't let them trick you.

01:16 Remember what I said.

01:16 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

01:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

01:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

01:46 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

01:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

01:50 You stand up from a narrow bunk.

01:50 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]

01:50 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a personal hoverpallet, and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise is dozing on a narrow bunk.
You can go out.

01:50 I don't understand that.

01:50  You are wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

01:50 You are carrying nothing.

01:50 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Crew Quarters; Mid]

01:50 You see a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and coral rocks here.
You can go north, east, south, and west.
Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

01:50 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Crew Quarters; Fore]

01:50 You can go north, east, south, west, and up.
Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

01:50 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

01:50 You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a sparkly ouija board, and a medium-sized crystal ball here.
Ryan Thomas is sleeping on the floor. Ali Candan is sleeping on a charcoal gray velvet sofa.
Morris Corlew is sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug. Keegan Wantz and Melinda Michaels are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa. Gonzales Bourne is standing here. Kani Kahakai is sitting on Melinda Michaels's lap.
You can go east, south, and west.
Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

01:50 You wave.

01:50 You sit down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:50 You say, "Hi everyone."

01:50 Melinda Michaels waves.

01:50 Kani Kahakai waves to you.

01:50 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "But it's fuuuuun. Leave me and my swinging on branches alone."

01:50 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:50 You say over the linked rift comm, "Hello all."

01:50 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I am not a swinger."

01:51 Kani Kahakai exclaims, "Evenia? Swinging? Surely not!"

01:51 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

01:51 Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:51 You chuckle.

01:51 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "This is why I said swinging on branches, not what he hinted at."

01:52 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:52 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh?"

01:52 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Kani Kahakai's shoulder.

01:52 Kani Kahakai says, "Man, her boyfriend beat me to it."

01:52 Kani Kahakai glances around at her surroundings.

01:52 Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:53 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:53 You say over the linked rift comm, "The only swinging I know about, or will admit to knowing about, is swinging on branches or swings."

01:53 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes. Because I knew he'd bring up swinging, and that would open a huge can of worms."

01:53 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Swing on the ropes."

01:56 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

01:59 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

01:59 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a sparkly ouija board, a medium-sized crystal ball, and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.

(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

01:59 I don't understand that.

01:59 I see no "lily" here.

02:00 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

02:00 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves and smiles.

02:00 FCI Scout Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:00 You kiss FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

02:00 You wrap your arms around FCI Scout Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:00 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

02:00 FCI Scout Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:00 FCI Scout Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:00 You remove a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

02:01 You give a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

02:01 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

02:01 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Oh you could have kept her longer..."

02:01 FCI Scout Lily Kaise puts on a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

02:01 You grin at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

02:01 FCI Scout Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:01 Lily says to you, "Oh I see you can only tolerate so much lizard-sitting."

02:01 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

02:02 You laugh. "Nah, just thought you'd like to have her back."

02:02 Kani Kahakai abandons her spoon and slurps down the last of a cold cup of clam chowder, draining the cup.

02:02 Kani Kahakai gives a foam cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

02:03 Kani Kahakai pats Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lightly.

02:03 Kani says to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, "Thanks tegan!"

02:03 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Kani Kahakai's shoulder.

02:04 Melinda Michaels tickles Kani Kahakai!

02:07 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

02:09 Melinda says to Kani, "Up please?"

02:10 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "We are at 3.5 LTC's. Course check time?"

02:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:12 Kani Kahakai stands up from Melinda Michaels's lap.

02:12 Melinda Michaels stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

02:12 Melinda Michaels strides south.

02:12 Kani Kahakai sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

02:12 Kani Kahakai stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

02:12 Kani Kahakai sashays south.

02:12 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Course check."

02:12 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:12 The voice of Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "May I have some more peach tea?"

02:12 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

02:12 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

02:13 The voice of Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh he's asleep."

02:14 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We are in the great unknown."

02:15 Coordinate rundown:
Starships: Blackwing Yalobusha (League) at (2, 15, 8) and Zéro Des Cartes (EAOS) at (1, 16, 9)


02:15 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We are."

02:15 FCI Scout Lily Kaise
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap, a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing 
02:15 a Tardick lizard named Asteria. Her face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

02:17 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "It's 18 light-years."

02:17 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "And nobody over there vacated the ship?"

02:18 The voice of Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Nope."

02:18 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "No, but let me check to be sure."

02:18 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Seems we're all aboard."

02:18 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:19 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:19 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:19 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

02:19 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Two of the LTC, you said?"

02:19 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Sorry, that's 29 light-years. My bad."

02:19 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "It's been a long day."

02:21 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

03:37 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "Pretty much."

03:37 Melinda Michaels says, "This is very bad."

03:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "The Fringe signing on made them more bold I'm sure."

03:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

03:37 Kani Kahakai says, "Yeah..."

03:46 You nod to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:46 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:46 Kani says to Lily, "She's back because you guys have created the conditions for her to be able to come back."

03:47 Kani Kahakai says, "With little more than a slap on the wrist."

03:47 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Even if it goes against the AEU Government. I suspect i'm already in deep shit for coming along on this Expedition but I chose to and I'm glad I have."

03:59 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah thought he was still in prison."

03:59 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

03:59 Kani Kahakai says, "I thought I saw news about him recently."

04:02 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Not that many. Let's see."

04:02 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:02 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

04:02 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

04:02 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

04:03 Melinda says to Lily, "Well speaking for myself, if y'all take some big stand against this, you have my support if there is anything I can do to help."

04:03 You say to Melinda, "Thank you. We appreciate that."

04:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:03 Lily eyes look wistful and she says: 'thank you.

04:04 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

04:04 Melinda Michaels says, "I imagine Ather will want to be secretive though. But if you feel you need help, don't hesitate to ask regardless of what he tells you."

04:07 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

04:08 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Nissi, given this news, I will offer the pod ship if some want to get home in a rush once we get the mission underway. Unless you think I ought to just hold off."

04:08 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

04:08 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

04:08 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:08 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:08 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

04:08 Gonzales Bourne glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

04:08 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

04:08 You say, "I, personally don't' want to go home yet. I want to see this mission through."

04:08 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Seven lightyears."

04:08 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks Ian!"

04:09 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "That is pretty close."

04:09 Nissi Valdaire says to Melinda, "I think it depends on what the council does."

04:09 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

04:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Well we'll do whatever ather wants us to do but I'm in no hurry to go back but I will do what ather requires of me."

04:09 Melinda Michaels says, "I'd like to find out if other statements have been made."

04:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

04:10 Nissi Valdaire says, "You should probably stop just doing whatever Ather wants you to do."

04:10 You nod.

04:10 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

04:10 Melinda Michaels says, "She's got a point guys."

04:10 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

04:10 Kani Kahakai says, "You should absolutely insist to take a new direction."

04:10 Melinda Michaels says, "Not to speak against Ather here but y'all have thoughts too."

04:10 Kani Kahakai says, "Without fail."

04:11 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Well I don't tink ather likes Janus."

04:11 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

04:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "Not to mention Ather started you down this way and has mostly happily continued it."

04:11 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Kani Kahakai's shoulder.

04:11 Melinda Michaels asks, "Do y'all know Kim and Constantine had a talk with us?"

04:11 Kani Kahakai says, "He claims to not like Best either, but apparently voted for him and would again, happily."

04:11 Melinda Michaels says, "About sitting down, having talks to come up with maybe some ideas."

04:11 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:11 Kani Kahakai shrugs.

04:12 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

04:12 Lily says to Nissi, "I have to say that I agree with you and I sure would not Vote again for Best. I'd strangle him first."

04:12 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

04:12 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:12 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

04:12 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I see it. I see a thing. I wonder what it could be."

04:13 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Huh."

04:13 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "They have a plant. Their sensors are a bit better."

04:13 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

04:13 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "But heh where would us soon to be Rogues go for asylum. Nowhere..."

04:13 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps imperatively, indicating that it has finished receiving a message.

04:13 The computer announces, "QE message from AFW Command received."

04:13 You say to Melinda, "I'll talk with Ather and see what he has to say, then decide."

04:13 Kani Kahakai says, "Best could probably deport Ather's cousins and he'd probably keep going along and getting along."

04:13 Nissi Valdaire glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

04:13 Melinda Michaels nods to you.

04:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:14 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to you. "That's my plan as well."

04:15 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

04:15 Kani Kahakai pouts at Melinda Michaels.

04:15 Melinda Michaels grins at Kani Kahakai.

04:15 Ali Candan strides in from the south.
Kani Kahakai sits down on Melinda Michaels's lap.

04:15 Melinda says to Kani, "Sorry."

04:15 Kani says to Melinda, "Cruel."

04:16 Ali Candan strides east.

04:16 Melinda says to Kani, "I am not."

04:16 Melinda Michaels pouts.

04:16 The voice of Aisling the Fox comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Are you responding?"

04:16 Ali Candan strides in from the east.

04:16 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

04:16 Keegan Wantz stretches.

04:16 Keegan Wantz says, "Staging point, staging point, hurrah a staging point."

04:16 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

04:16 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:16 A designated mission staging point appears to be 16.67 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Southwest and Up.

04:16 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Looks like we're just about to arrive at the staging area. We're going to hold tight here for a few hours, like I said earlier. Make whatever preparations you need to."

04:16 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Want me to steer us in?"

04:16 You smile.

04:17 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

04:17 Kani Kahakai says, "I still advocate international pilots' union."

04:17 Kani Kahakai gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

04:18 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

04:18 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Hey Jim, things are getting sticky back home. You are welcome to take a look unless y'all have your own news receiving device."

04:18 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

04:18 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

04:18 Jim Gruffudd walks in from the south.

04:18 You wave at an improved temporary wormhole drive.

04:18 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If you guys can watch the tea drinking competition I want to know who's doing good currently."

04:18 Jim Gruffudd

04:18 He appears to be 54 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has tan skin. His body is thin with muscled hips and firm calves. He has broad shoulders and a wide chest. His face is round and weathered, with a straight nose and round chin. His lips are thin and pale and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of wild eyebrows, his eyes are blue and round. His very short, bristly hair is salt and pepper and unkempt. He also has a very short salt and pepper neatly trimmed beard. He has square pale fingernails.
 He is wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. He is also wearing a rugged dark brown shoulder bag and a black leather hip holster. His face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

04:18 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:19 The voice of Aisling the Fox comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I think we should stop at staging point first and go from there."

04:19 Melinda Michaels says, "Looks like AEU has granted the rogue navy amnesty."

04:19 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Is staging point thing we are staying two years of light away from?"

04:19 Jim Gruffudd frowns.

04:19 Keegan Wantz says, "Not... ideal."

04:20 Melinda Michaels says, "And Janus is being investigated to see if she did anything wrong."

04:20 Jim Gruffudd says, "Well, that's bad. But we can't do anything about it now. Or at all, more than likely. We need to stay focused on the mission."

04:20 Kani says to Keegan, "I think you mean to say: worst case scenario."

04:20 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup we do."

04:20 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to Jim Gruffudd.

04:22 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Kani Kahakai's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:22 Jim Gruffudd says, "I'm sure it'll be fine. Politicians, you know."

04:22 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

04:23 Melinda Michaels says, "But the mission is priority right now. They'll probably argue over Janus for a year anyway."

04:23 Jim Gruffudd says, "Could be."

04:23 Keegan Wantz nods.

04:24 Keegan Wantz says, "Almost at the waypoint, in that regard."

04:24 Jim Gruffudd says, "Can't let thoughts of home shake you. You know we're sneaking past Outsider space within 300, 200 light-years all the way home? Gotta stay on your toes, even if things go well here."

04:24 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

04:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:24 Melinda Michaels says, "Nothing we can do way out here."

04:25 Melinda Michaels nods.

04:25 You say, "Exactly."

04:26 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the south.

04:26 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll be fine. The crew here seems pretty calm and responsible thus far."

04:26 Jim Gruffudd says, "That's good. Whatever the situation here might be, we're going to need that."

04:26 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

04:26 You nod.

04:26 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn nods.

04:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup, be ready for what you least expect."

04:27 Kani Kahakai exclaims, "I totally expected this!"

04:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "We have a very critical mission to accomplish and this is as importantant for the well-being of mankind as anything."

04:27 You nod to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

04:27 Kani Kahakai says, "Though admittedly, I was not ready for it..."

04:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

04:27 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "So do we have an estimated time when we'll be deploying from the uh... mission point?"

04:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Jim said to expect everything."

04:28 Melinda Michaels says, "Something like that."

04:28 Melinda says to Hawthorn, "I think we told people 22:00 to midnight. You may not have been awake?"

04:28 Jim Gruffudd says, "Likely 2200, or sometime around then."

04:29 Melinda Michaels nods.

04:29 You nod.

04:29 You say, "Thought that was on the post."

04:29 You say, "Or in the post."

04:31 Morris rubs his eyes.

04:31 Melinda Michaels says, "Almost there."

04:31 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Our distance to the target is constantly increasing, but in reverse."

04:36 Keegan Wantz says, "Also, I am distressed that I have not yet been interviewed."

04:36 Keegan Wantz winks at FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn.

04:36 The voice of Aisling the Fox comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I do not expect anything weird. So there is going to be something weird for sure."

04:37 Jim Gruffudd asks, "Who's doing interviews?"

04:37 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Melinda has conducted a couple."

04:37 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

04:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Not really."

04:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Oh that."

You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a sparkly ouija board, and a medium-sized crystal ball here.
Ryan Thomas is sleeping on the floor.
Keegan Wantz, FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn, and Ali Candan are standing here.
You can go east, south, and west.

05:28 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "It's safe to do that when something is incoming."

05:28 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, the consequences of mistakingly powering up weapons systems are low."

05:28 You peer north...

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Thick bundles of wiring stream in from several locations on the walls, carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A few cables rest on the ground, haphazardly placed as if the focus was on utility over sparsity. There is only a small, reinforced viewport visible on the airlock hatch, allowing you to view outside the ship. The room's focus is the main display board: essential functions like shipwide power control and alert status are controlled here. A few secondary boards have been haphazardly placed near the primary display, but they seem to possess only the barest functionality. The room is surprisingly spacious, though the random placement of equipment makes it difficult for anyone but the pilot to truly be comfortable here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a dark purple leather captain's chair, a soft dark purple leather couch with a lilac throw pillow and a dusky blue throw pillow on it, an oval charcoal gray area rug, a mahogany coffee table, an interdictor launcher, a dark gray holo projector, Vin the arachnoid security robot, a white plastic box labeled 'Original Space Imager Images', a black storage locker, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Nissi Valdaire is sitting on a dark purple leat
05:28 her captain's chair. Melinda Michaels, Kani Kahakai, and Morris Corlew are standing here.
You can go south, up, and out.

05:33 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

05:34 You gently caress FCI Scout Lily Kaise's back and waist.

05:36 Lily says to you, "Ok Love, I will let you rest. I'm not sure I will do much sleeping but we'll manage. You know, we'll get through this somehow."

Important news has been received from home. It appears that President Best has granted amnesty to notorious Rogue Navy. Message said that Kendra Janus is to be investigated to see if she is guilty of wrong doing. A message is going out now from some of the AEU pilots to the AEU government, stating they are renouncing citizenship. I am posting this here because messages are split between both ships QE devices.

That is all for now.

We're at the staging point. Operations should begin between 2200 and midnight or so.

There is an Outsider blockade nearby, probably automated. Some probes already jumped us. Don't panic but be on alert, ready to gun or scramble a fighter. We got a few minutes notice of incoming, so there's time to react. Needless to say we'll probably have to address this thing tomorrow.

16:47 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]

16:47 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a personal hoverpallet, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

Star Conquest Help: Losing Citizenship
--
Category: Background

There are two primary ways to 'lose' citizenship in an alliance.

RENOUNCING CITIZENSHIP

With a single specific exception, gaining citizenship with a new alliance requires the individual to renounce their citizenship of their original (or current) alliance.  
In order to renounce citizenship it must be done in person, at an embassy of the alliance being renounced.  This is usually done while in the process of gaining citizenship in another alliance, and until the new citizenship process is completed the individual is considered 'stateless'.  Being 'stateless' is not the same thing as being considered 'unregistered', though it does limit an individual's rights considerably.

The exception of course is the EAOS, where inductees (both permanent and temporary) gain automatic dual-citizenship for the duration of their induction into the EAOS, unless the individual specifically chooses to renounce their alliance of origin.  Temporary inductees become denaturalised EAOS citizens at the end of their induction term.

NOTE: Renouncing citizenship of an alliance ONLY removes your legal protections and rights given to you by that alliance.  The majority of the legal obligations an individual holds to their alliance of citizenship remain for some time even after renouncing their citizenship, such as taxes, contracts, and so on.

DENATURALISATION

As oppos
17:12 ed to actively choosing to remove citizenship yourself, losing citizenship without your choice is far more difficult.  

The most commonly known form is by 'going unreg' - specifically stealing alliance technology and resources and heading into deep space, never to return.  This does not count as renouncing your citizenship, instead this process forces the alliance in question to 'denaturalise' the individual who 'goes unreg' and force-remove their citizenship due to their breaking of a specific clause enshrined in interalliance law: by 'going unreg' the individual has committed high treason in a fundamental, irreversable way.

The Grand Amnesty removes the crime of treason and other negative aspects of 'going unreg' for anyone who did so prior to 21st August 2304, but does not restore their citizenship.  Individuals who have 'gone unreg' after 21st August 2304 are not covered by the Grand Amnesty unless this is specifically added in an amendment to the Grand Amnesty by the alliance government of origin.  Otherwise the individual is considered a traitor and guilty of high treason, etc.

17:59 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]

17:59 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a personal hoverpallet, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

Hello everyong, I know the staff has planned really hard for this event and I had every intention of being there, but it seems that I have been signed up for a tux fitting for my brother's wedding so this may not occur, if not I'll try and be available for everything else hopefully. It's a rather inconvinient time for me, but it can't be helped, and believe me I tried.

until then I'm around until I'm not.

Well, we don't usually do this, but since we are, when things go beyond midnight, they get difficult for me, as midnight game time is 1 AM where I live, so I suspect I'll be pulling an all nighter for this.

22:13 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I am."

22:13 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Control room."

22:13 FCI Scout Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

22:13 You stand up from a narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it.

22:14 You remove a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots from a leather briefcase.

22:14 FCI Scout Lily Kaise removes a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

22:14 You tug a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots onto your feet.

22:14 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Control Room]

22:14 You see a dark purple leather captain's chair, a soft dark purple leather couch with a lilac throw pillow and a dusky blue throw pillow on it, an oval charcoal gray area rug, a mahogany coffee table, an interdictor launcher, a dark gray holo projector, Vin the arachnoid security robot, a white plastic box labeled 'Original Space Imager Images', a black storage locker, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a Tardick lizard named Freyja here.
Nissi Valdaire is sitting on a dark purple leather captain's chair. Ali Candan is sitting on a soft dark purple leather couch. Wendy Arroyo is sitting on Nissi Valdaire's lap. Keegan Wantz is seated. Jim Gruffudd and FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn are standing here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:14 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn sits down on a soft dark purple leather couch with a lilac throw pillow and a dusky blue throw pillow on it.

22:14 You wave to Jim Gruffudd.

22:14 Jim Gruffudd puts a glossy black holodisc titled "Blockade Station Briefing" in a dark gray holo projector.

22:14 You say to Jim, "Evening sir."

22:14 Ali Candan asks, "Melinda is also awake I think. Is she still in the other ship?"

22:14 FCI Scout Lily Kaise walks in from the south.

22:14 Jim Gruffudd says, "At least I didn't have to go hunting for one of these."

22:14 You grin.

22:14 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn smiles.

22:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

22:15 Morris Corlew shuffles in from the south.

22:15 Ali says to Jim, "Should we call for Melinda?"

22:15 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:15 The voice of FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hey Mel."

22:15 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:15 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Paging Melinda to your ship."

22:15 Melinda Michaels just entered the ship.

22:15 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

22:15 Melinda Michaels says, "I have returned."

22:15 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves and smiles at Melinda Michaels.

22:15 Melinda Michaels waves.

22:15 Morris Corlew gives Melinda Michaels a thumbs up!

22:16 Jim Gruffudd says, "As I was saying... let's talk about this blockade station."

22:16 Melinda Michaels puts a heavy duty faux wood holo recorder in a black canvas gear bag.

22:16 Jim Gruffudd sets a dark gray holo projector upright and turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color show begins.

22:16 Melinda Michaels nods to Jim Gruffudd.

22:16 [From the projector] An image appears of an artificial object floating in space. It looks dark and glossy and appears to be made of coiled tentacles in the manner of Outsider constructs, but it has clearly been taken from a great distance, and the details are fuzzy. A quiet, cheery tune begins to play.

22:16 [From the projector] The voice of Jim Gruffudd speaks over the image, narrating laconically in a weary, sardonic tone. "This is an Outsider blockade station."

22:16 [From the projector] "Let's get a better look." The station is outlined in three-dimensional wireframe, then fills itself in with crisp, computer-generated detail.

22:16 [From the projector] A few points around the station start blinking. "The station has what Ian calls 'aggressive interdiction.' Not only will it stop us from leaving once we're near it, it'll pull us right out of the rift if we try to get around it."

22:17 Hawthorn gives a low whistle.

22:17 Morris Corlew winces.

22:17 [From the projector] The shot zooms into what's represented as the top of the station, where a large turret is mounted. "This is the station's main cannon. It's probably dangerous out to a good distance. Don't get your mothership too close to it."

22:17 You say, "Yikes."

22:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh oh."

22:17 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah ouch."

22:17 [From the projector] The image rotates to show a side view. A line-of-sight is drawn from the main cannon, then interrupted by the sharp angle between the top and side of the station. "It has a weakness, though. It can't fire down very well at things too close to the hull."

22:17 [From the projector] The view pans down, and a scattering of smaller turrets mounted on the hull are highlighted. "But the Outsiders thought of that. They have point defense turrets all over the hull."

22:17 [From the projector] The view rotates to show the front of the station, then a zig-zagging path is drawn, moving from turret to turret until it reaches the main cannon. "Still, though, something like this is probably our best shot. Get in close with smaller ships, change direction a lot so the point defense turrets have trouble tracking you, then take a shot at the main cannon."

22:18 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Seems so much like a FAS not exactly obviously."

22:18 You say, "Wow."

22:18 [From the projector] An animation of the main cannon exploding plays. "It might take a few passes."

22:18 [From the projector] The view zooms out, and a few small ships are highlighted, labeled as drone ships. "Oh, and they'll probably have more of those drones around. Ian speculates they're fully autonomous machines, and he says they're probably very intelligent, though I haven't seen any evidence of it."

22:18 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "They probably stole the idea from the IFS...maybe."

22:18 [From the projector] The shot zooms back to the station, then the hull vanishes, showing the interior in cutaway. "The station seems to be hollow, probably so it can be serviced, though we don't think anything alive is in there right now."

22:18 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

22:18 You nod.

22:18 [From the projector] A point at the destroyed main cannon blinks. "It looks like we'll have the easiest time accessing it here, since we need the cannon destroyed anyway, unless we want to spend time cutting through a reinforced docking bay door."

22:18 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe the Outsiders and IFS are working together. Under the Chevaliers."

22:19 FCI Scout Lily Kaise blinks.

22:19 [From the projector] Another point blinks a distance away inside the station. "This seems to be the nerve center. There's always a nerve center. Disable it and we should be able to get past this thing and do our mission."

22:19 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

22:19 You nod.

22:19 [From the projector] "It's probably full of robots and lasers and so on. We'll say six to eight battlesuits should do the trick."

22:19 [From the projector] The voice of Georgie is heard faintly from offscreen. "Why don't the Outsiders man these stations? Even just one to watch over the robots?"

22:19 [From the projector] There is a short pause, then Jim says, "No need for one of them to be out here by itself. The Outsiders already know the truth... no matter who you're with, you're always alone."

22:19 [From the projector] The shot zooms back out, and the computer-generated graphics fade away, returning the view to that of the fuzzy, real-life image of the blockade station. The cheery music fades. "Any questions?"

22:19 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

22:20 The images above the holographic projector cease as the disc ends.

22:20 Jim Gruffudd removes a glossy black holodisc titled "Blockade Station Briefing" from a dark gray holo projector.

22:20 Jim Gruffudd asks, "Any questions?"

22:20 Melinda Michaels asks, "How close are we gonna need to get in order to launch the suits?"

22:21 Jim Gruffudd says, "Next to it, like usual."

22:22 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Phew that is going to be hectic."

22:22 You nod.

22:22 Ali says to Jim, "For shooting the cannon, is a corvette small enough? Or do we need fighters?"

22:22 "Disabling with fighters and destroying with suits." Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Will we need the fighter crew to stay up in the event drones are launched while the suit crew is inside?"

22:22 Jim Gruffudd says, "The corvette should be small enough. And the fighters too, of course. They'll need decent pilots."

22:22 Melinda Michaels nods.

22:23 Keegan Wantz nods.

22:23 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm a decent gunner, not a good pilot though."

22:23 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Not for...something this technical at least."

22:23 Morris Corlew asks, "Are the suits goin in while the fighters are still up? Or will we be able to disable it enough from the outside before sendin suits in?"

22:23 Jim Gruffudd says, "You might want someone paying attention in space, yeah. Ian thinks it's got onboard manufacturing, but we don't know how fast they can replace lost drones."

22:23 Morris Corlew nods.

22:23 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

22:23 You nod.

22:24 Jim Gruffudd says, "You'll want to blow up the main cannon first. In fact, you'll have to."

22:24 Morris Corlew nods.

22:24 You say, "Right."

22:24 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Any way we can talk to the suits once they're inside?"

22:24 Morris Corlew asks, "Any idea if they autotarget like long-range lasers, or...will the fighter pilots get lock notifications?"

22:25 Melinda says to Nissi, "You'll be staying with Yalobusha, correct?"

22:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."

22:26 Keegan Wantz says, "I can do a bastille, unless you want me in the Corvette."

22:26 Jim says to Wendy, "I don't think so, unless you've got a comms systems I don't know about."

22:26 You say to Jim, "When are we planning to start the attack?"

22:27 Wendy Arroyo asks, "I take it we should take our highest tier suits?"

22:27 Jim says to Morris, "We haven't seen the point defense turrets in action, but it looks like they rely on volume of fire more than anything."

22:27 Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.

22:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Ali and Gonzo Corvette. Keegan, Shule and Morris fighters. Nissi will need some of us in the galleon."

22:27 Jim says to you, "The attack will start at 2200, or earlier if everybody is ready."

22:27 You nod to Jim Gruffudd.

22:27 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

22:27 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'll do Galleon."

22:28 Melinda says to Hawthorn, "That was the plan."

22:28 Jim says to Wendy, "That would be a good idea, yeah."

22:28 Wendy Arroyo says, "I'm staying with the Buran, then."

22:28 Hawthorn says to Melinda, "Good!"

22:28 Keegan Wantz nods.

22:28 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn grins.

22:28 You say to Melinda, "I won't be available right at 2200. I'm sorry."

22:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Ill obviously be with the Galleon until we're ready for Ground."

22:28 Keegan Wantz says, "Do not autopilot straight at the cannon aye."

22:28 Keegan Wantz coughs.

22:28 Melinda Michaels nods to you.

22:28 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll adjust then."

22:28 Melinda Michaels asks, "Anyone else who won't be ready?"

22:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

22:29 Wendy Arroyo says, "I'm good for any time. Earlier the better."

22:29 Jim Gruffudd says, "Yeah, you'll want to move around a bit to keep those turrets from getting a bead on you."

22:29 Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.

22:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I'm likewise open for the rest of the evening and many hours after."

22:29 Keegan Wantz says, "Another hour and a half, might be able to be ready earlier."

22:29 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:29 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Anyone alive over there?"

22:29 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Several."

22:29 Jim Gruffudd gives a glossy black holodisc titled "Blockade Station Briefing" to Melinda Michaels.

22:29 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I am dead sir, how may I assist you?"

22:30 Melinda says to Jim, "Would you mind coming with me to the other ship so they can see this recording?"

22:30 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

22:30 Melinda Michaels says, "Never mind."

22:30 Melinda Michaels grins.

22:30 Gonzales Bourne asks, "Oh. Can I watch it there too?"

22:30 Jim Gruffudd nods.

22:30 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:30 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Got a briefing on the blockade station, Mel's coming over I think."

22:30 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "They are all illusions, it's a trick."

22:30 Melinda Michaels says, "I can just take it over and sort things out with that crew."

22:30 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oy. Action time already? Thanks Keegs."

22:31 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "So where will the Ground crew be sorted Melinda?"

22:31 Jim Gruffudd says, "It won't be flying quite like you're used to. You'll need to be right up against the hull to avoid the main cannon's fire, and moving around a lot to evade most of the point defense."

22:31 Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.

22:31 You nod to Jim Gruffudd.

22:31 Keegan Wantz nods.

22:31 Morris Corlew asks, "Will our starmaps mark the locations of the main cannon...or better yet our autopilots?"

22:31 Jim Gruffudd says, "Use your manual control keys to set a direction and just keep moving. Fire when something's in range."

22:31 Melinda Michaels says, "I'll go do that then."

22:31 Keegan Wantz says, "More how I fly when I'm being cheeky and trying to solo things in a destroyer, I think."

22:31 Keegan Wantz nods.

22:31 Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.

22:32 Melinda Michaels says, "I am gonna have them yell there questions over the link."

22:32 You say, "Makes sense."

22:32 Jim Gruffudd says, "Starmap will work. The computer will keep you updated too."

22:32 Melinda Michaels holds Gonzales Bourne's hand, taking him into her group.

22:32 Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.

22:32 Melinda Michaels gives Jim Gruffudd a thumbs up!

22:32 Melinda Michaels's group strides out.

22:32 Wendy says to Nissi, "You want me gunning? Fixing the ship?"

22:32 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

22:32 Nissi says to Wendy, "Gunning!"

22:32 Wendy Arroyo nods.

22:33 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "So guess i'm gunning and not on ground crew."

22:33 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Mm."

22:33 Morris Corlew says, "Don't think ground crew's been sorted yet? Unless I missed it."

22:33 You say, "Not sure ground crew has been decided."

22:34 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "We'll have to have that probably sorted before we do this yeah..."

22:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "No but seems the ground crew should be in the other Galleon no?"

22:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Whichever, I'll just do what I can."

22:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles.

22:34 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

22:35 Morris glances questioningly at Jim. "Since we gotta disable the weaponry first, I imagine it may not matter too much?"

22:35 Nissi Valdaire says, "Don't worry, I don't think I'll be doing much either. But I didn't come here to fight Outsider robots."

22:35 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Did we figure out how much range the thing has?"

22:35 Wendy Arroyo says, "A lot is what I hear."

22:35 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "The mega cannon that is."

22:36 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "So the galleon will have to stay out far away then. And skirt the edges of the sector."

22:36 Jim says to Morris, "Unless we're being constantly assaulted by drones, there will be time to transfer people over, I'd imagine."

22:36 Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.

22:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

22:37 Jim Gruffudd says, "And don't worry, I'm sure we'll figure out the range of the cannon."

22:37 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Trial and error."

22:37 Morris Corlew nods.

22:38 Keegan Wantz says, "Hopefully it doesn't destroy one of the fighters outright."

22:38 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

22:39 Morris Corlew winces. "Yeah."

22:39 Wendy says to Jim, "How about the homeworld? Sensors see anything about it this far out, maybe?"

22:39 You say, "Yeah."

22:39 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that was my concern too A LRL is wicked enough but a long-range cannon."

22:39 Lily winces.

22:39 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah. That...might hurt a bit."

22:39 Jim says to Wendy, "A little bit. We'll worry about that after. Nothing too troubling so far, though."

22:40 Wendy Arroyo nods. "In time all things, I guess."

22:41 Wendy Arroyo says, "Are we sure we can destroy it with conventional weapons? We have considerably fewer ships to ram into it this time around."

22:41 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn blinks.

22:41 Keegan Wantz says, "Well, even with turtle tech."

22:41 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Just to clarify, we do have some people with lower-level suits. Those people should not go into the station?"

22:42 Keegan Wantz says, "The guns are still vulnerable."

22:42 Wendy Arroyo says, "Yeah, but those are thralls, I think."

22:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:43 Jim Gruffudd leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:43 The voice of Jim Gruffudd comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "You don't have six high tier battlesuits aboard?"

22:43 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We do."

22:43 Keegan Wantz says, "My brain might be failing me a little, but I think we also were able to disable the Magistrate's weapons beforehand. That or the Mules hitting it just made it freak out."

22:43 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I was just getting clarification so that crews can be sorted properly."

22:43 Keegan Wantz says, "And that's the biggest Outsider ship I've ever seen, so."

22:43 Keegan Wantz shrugs.

22:44 Keegan Wantz says, "Might have something else on the station."

22:44 Jim Gruffudd says, "We don't expect to destroy the station. But the main cannon looks vulnerable."

22:44 Morris Corlew nods.

22:44 The voice of Erik Goodwin comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We have 16 high tier suits aboard."

22:44 Keegan Wantz nods.

22:44 Wendy Arroyo says, "Works for me."

22:45 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Are we going to take care of everything in one fell swoop, then? Disable the station and move right onto contact?"

22:46 Jim Gruffudd says, "That's the plan."

22:46 Wendy Arroyo examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

22:46 Wendy Arroyo helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

22:46 Morris Corlew says, "Sounds good."

22:46 Wendy says to a cup of hot black coffee, "Black Giddy up."

22:46 Wendy Arroyo takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

22:46 Wendy Arroyo glances down at her tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

22:47 Jim Gruffudd says, "Taking our time was never in the cards, I'm afraid. We'll need to make sure we can make it back home, too."

22:47 Morris Corlew nods. "Charge and whatnot."

22:47 Keegan Wantz nods.

22:48 Keegan Wantz says, "We got out here with surprisingly, to me, little wear on the furnace."

22:48 Keegan Wantz says, "But I'm used to tactical platforms, I think."

22:48 Keegan Wantz coughs.

22:48 Wendy Arroyo says, "The furnace has almost two entire charges remaining, so that shouldn't be an issue."

22:48 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "This thing has a much larger battery life, yeah."

22:48 Keegan Wantz says, "Not so much, the Siren's most of the extra battery."

22:49 Keegan Wantz says, "But being able to catch much more of the flow is nice."

22:49 Wendy says to Jim, "Oh, something came up while we were talking earlier."

22:49 Jim Gruffudd asks, "What's that?"

22:49 Wendy says to Jim, "Assuming we get talking and land, are we taking the galleon or a smaller ship? I don't expect to find many roomy landing pads."

22:50 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Plan for everything."

22:50 Jim Gruffudd says, "I don't think landing will be an issue."

22:50 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Reckon?"

22:51 Wendy Arroyo shrugs. "I mean, all the better, just double-checking."

22:51 Jim Gruffudd says, "We have a site picked out. We'll verify once we're in orbit."

22:51 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'll be ready in an hour gonna start prepping."

22:51 Keegan Wantz says, "I suspect that if we do lan- oh, that works."

22:52 Morris Corlew says, "I just hope we're not only the second aliens these folks've ever met."

22:52 Keegan Wantz says, "Was thinking that they'll probably see us over the planet."

22:52 Keegan Wantz shrugs.

22:52 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

22:52 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn nods.

22:52 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn stands up from a soft dark purple leather couch with a lilac throw pillow and a dusky blue throw pillow on it.

22:52 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

22:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "I am ready."

22:53 Wendy says to Jim, "Do you have any general order tips for setting foot on new planets that you might share? Anything, I guess."

22:53 Wendy Arroyo nods. "And yeah. Ready."

22:53 Jim Gruffudd says, "Be prepared for anything and don't get greedy."

22:54 Morris Corlew nods.

22:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:54 You nod.

22:54 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

22:55 Wendy Arroyo says, "Works."

22:55 Wendy Arroyo takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

22:57 Wendy Arroyo takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

22:58 Morris rubs his palms on the sides of a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder.

23:00 Nissi rests her chin on Wendy's shoulder.

23:00 Wendy Arroyo kisses Nissi Valdaire lovingly on the top of her head.

23:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

23:05 Keegan Wantz nods.

23:06 Jim Gruffudd says, "Excuse me. I'll be back when we're ready to go."

23:06 Jim Gruffudd walks south.

23:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise walks south.

23:09 Morris Corlew sits down on a soft dark purple leather couch with a lilac throw pillow and a dusky blue throw pillow on it.

23:09 You say, "Be back later."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

23:13 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a personal hoverpallet, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out.
