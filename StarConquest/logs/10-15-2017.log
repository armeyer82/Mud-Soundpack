00:01 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Alko where'd you go?"

00:01 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh."

00:01 [General Communication] Alko Delovega laughs.

00:02 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Sorry about that, grabbing my suit."

00:02 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "No problem."

00:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We were all on the ship, like spread out over three rooms, north to south."

00:02 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

00:02 [General Communication] "Hide in the ducts." Evenia Callseah chuckles. "It takes people ages to think to look there."

00:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oi, he just did that very thing."

00:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah giggles.

00:05 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

00:06 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

00:09 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

00:17 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

00:26 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "With only about a half hour and change remaining, I wanted to give this second-to-last reminder that we do have an upcoming meeting! If anyone is not near AEU space, they should probably start getting there. Again, a quick reminder: if you have topics you want to discuss other than the Mutuality and the QSA, please have all of your points ready for presentation before you come to the meeting and thank you."

00:29 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

00:30 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's just going to be us at this meeting, correct? No liaison or clipboard man?"

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The clipboard guy really made us get off topic last time."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Representatives from the liaison office were invited to attend. It is unknown whether or not they will."

00:37 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Toll Station from the two-person medium transport "Galactic Southern Cassowary". The organization has earned 1,598,467.82 credits.

00:42 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

00:44 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

00:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser from a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top.

00:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

00:44 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:48 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

00:49 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

00:49 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:49 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

00:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

00:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

00:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok going to head over to New Earth."

00:50 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Alko, you alive?"

00:50 You smile.

00:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm not changing clothes either."

00:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:50 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I gave Ather a note per my concern I raised."

00:50 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Yeah."

00:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He didn't seem pleased."

00:50 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Okay good."

00:50 You say, "Oh."

00:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Guess he thinks people forget things."

00:51 You ask, "What was the concern?"

00:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:51 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:51 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:51 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:51 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:51 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

00:51 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

00:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't because this is really at the crux of our issues with the Mutuality."

00:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

00:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

00:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:51 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There are other issues obviously but accusing them of stealing tech they took very seriously."

00:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

00:52 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

00:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

00:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

00:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident switches a toggle on her metallic gold touch einrophone.

00:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

00:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "With just under 10 minutes to go, all pilots should begin making their ways to the new earth conference room so that we can get this meeting going in a timely manner. Please make sure that your phones are silenced, and that you don't have one of those idiotic felo games going off during the meeting. Representatives from the liaison office might attend this discussion."

00:53 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:53 You scramble to your feet.

00:53 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:53 You exit the ship.

00:53 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

00:53  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of relaxed fit light khaki cargo pants, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a black engineering tool case, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, and a flight control scanner. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

00:53 You are carrying nothing.

00:53 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

00:53 You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

00:53 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

00:53 You see a friendly cadet orientation officer here.
You can go north, up, and out.

00:53 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

00:53 You can go north, east, south, and west.

00:53 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]
You can go north, east, south, and west.

00:53 The door is open, so you walk on in.

00:53 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Conference Room]
You see the AEU civilian pilot corps voting machine, the AEU nomination machine, a patriotically painted donations box, and a shiny green trash bin here.
Johnathon Triggs and Eli Grey are sitting on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair. Ather Jammoa and Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident are standing here.
You can go south.

00:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

00:53 You wave.

00:53 Ather Jammoa switches a toggle on his black flip einrophone.

00:53 Eli Grey waves.

00:53 You sit down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

00:53 Eli Grey takes a sip of a large mug of hot black coffee with cream and sugar.

00:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Silenced phone prior to arrival."

00:53 Ather Jammoa says, "Woo."

00:53 You say, "Same here."

00:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:54 Johnathon says to Eli, "Did you?"

00:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And have no stupid felo games on my person."

00:54 Johnathon Triggs grins.

00:54 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Toll Station from the two-person medium transport "Galactic Southern Cassowary". The organization has earned 817,347.17 credits.

00:54 Eli Grey says, "Not before I got here, no. It's silenced now though."

00:54 Johnathon Triggs nods to Eli Grey.

00:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or can always fling them into your backpack."

00:54 Johnathon Triggs glances down at his watch momentarily.

00:55 Eli Grey grins. "That's what I did when someone called me while I was broadcasting."

00:55 You say, "Personally, I highly dislike those felo games, but my own personal opinion."

00:55 Johnathon says to you, "What are they?"

00:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I think I have one in a box somewhere."

00:56 You say to Johnathon, "Electronic games where one simulates taking care of a felo... I think? I've never had one."

00:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd give it away but just another reason for someone else to annoy others."

00:56 Eli says to Johnathon, "It's al ittle electronic game that beeps."

00:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:56 You nod to Eli Grey. "Yeah, that."

00:56 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:56 Johnathon Triggs says, "I see.."

00:56 Eli Grey says, "It wants you to love it like a rela felo, so it beeps and beeps."

00:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah when felo need attion or you play with them."

00:56 You say, "And it beeps some more."

00:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:56 You say, "And drives everyone insane."

00:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And more and more if nobody pays attention."

00:57 Johnathon says to Eli, "Well.. if someone were to give it to me. I'd pass it off to a sanitation drone. So it had something to do when it had nothing to do."

00:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I remember one trip where Berry had one and she ignored it for hours."

00:57 Johnathon Triggs grins.

00:57 Ather Jammoa says, "It's fucking annoying. Aisling has one of those, and it keeps going off whenever she's not paying attention to it. It's worse on exploration trips."

00:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah."

00:57 You nod.

00:57 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

00:57 Constantine Stone waves.

00:57 Constantine Stone sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

00:57 You wave to Constantine Stone.

00:57 Eli Grey nods. "And it keeps a score of how long you've been a slave to it."

00:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So i'd suggest telling others to leave them home."

00:58 Constantine Stone switches a toggle on his plain touch einrophone.

00:58 Johnathon Triggs glances down at his watch momentarily.

00:58 Johnathon says to Constantine, "Cutting it close."

00:58 Johnathon Triggs grins at Constantine Stone.

00:58 Constantine Stone smiles.

00:58 Constantine Stone says, "I'm a busy guy."

00:58 You say, "But he's not late."

00:58 You say, "And that's all that matters."

00:58 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Bah. Long as he's here before the strike of the clock, he's not cutting it anything."

00:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

00:59 Ather glances towards the hallway with a raised eyebrow.

00:59 You peer south...

00:59 
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]
This short corridor leads to several offices, each one relating to a specific position within the pilot liaison hierarchy held by elected civilian pilots. To the west is the office for the Space Defense Captain, while east is the office for the Ground Squad Leader. The liaison conference room is just to the north. The door to the north is open, the door to the east is closed, and the door to the west is closed.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

00:59 Eli says to Ather, "That makes me wish we had an actual grandfather clock in here."

00:59 Constantine Stone says, "To tick ominously as we consider each other's proposals."

00:59 Johnathon says to Eli, "Know where to get one?"

00:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Naa because it would chime too loudly at half past and perhaps at other intervals."

01:00 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard walks in from the south.

01:00 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "What's a grandfather clock? A clock shaped like an old man?"

01:00 Constantine Stone says, "Ah."

01:00 Eli nods repsectfully to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.

01:00 Lily looks down at the floor.

01:00 Johnathon Triggs stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:00 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.

01:00 Constantine Stone says, "Glad you could join us, Ms. Richard."

01:00 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Hello. I'm Antoinette Richard, your primary liaison to the government."

01:00 Shule stands and bows to Antoinette before sitting back down.

01:00 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident bows to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.

01:01 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Delightful, delightful."

01:01 Johnathon Triggs bows to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.

01:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:01 Johnathon Triggs sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:01 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Right, I suppose we can get started."

01:01 Ather walks to the door and pulls it firmly shut.

01:01 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa closes the door.

01:01 Shule turns his attention to Ather.

01:02 Ather walks back to the table and glances briefly down at a stack of notes, before clearing his throat with a mechanical cough.

01:02 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Right, I just want to go through the timeline, for our liaison here. I'm sure she's been kept up to speed, but just for the sake of efficiency."

01:03 You nod.

01:03 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "As all of you know, members of the AEU went to try to renegotiate access to the Quantum skims within the last several months. The Mutuality council outright denied this request, due to the worry that opening the QSA to civilian pilots would also invite attacks by AEU naval forces. There were other concerns, but this seemed to be the biggest one."

01:03 Ather glances between Constantine and the others. "Am I correct in this assumption as far as it goes?"

01:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:03 You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa. "That is correct."

01:03 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Wonderful, wonderful."

01:03 Constantine Stone says, "I wasn't present at the meeting, but that's my understanding of what happened."

01:04 Eli Grey nods. "Same here."

01:04 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Well, regardless, opening the skims to one faction instead of the other is just something which cannot be done, or so they say."

01:04 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "So, as you all know, in the first day of my term as voice, I tried to push for a proposal requesting a guarantee of no hostilities from the government. A proposal which was supported by 100% of the pilots who voted for it. However, the government felt that as they see it, they do not need to make any such guarantees. At least, that was the message communicated to me by the liaison office."

01:05 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard nods.

01:05 Ather turns to Antoinette and asks, "Mis Richard, can you elaborate on that any further?"

01:05 Lily listens intently.

01:06 Johnathon looks from Ather to Antoinette.

01:07 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "What you're asking for is essentially a one way non-aggression pact. We would be obliged to hold to a certain course of action while the other party is not. I doubt the Union would be unique in not entertaining such a proposal."

01:07 Constantine Stone asks, "Do you think the government would be amenable to a mutual non-aggression pact?"

01:07 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "In the negotiation, Mis Richard, the pilots would see to it that the Mutuality would also offer this guarantee."

01:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:07 You nod.

01:08 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "There is no one-sided guarantee that's trying to be made here. It would be a Mutual pact all the time. We don't attack them, they don't attack us."

01:08 You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:08 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Both the AEU and the Mutuality council would offer this guarantee. However, the Mutuality council is concerned that the AEU government is not offerring such a guarantee at the present time."

01:08 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "If you can get a mutually beneficial set of terms in writing, I'm sure the administration will give it all due consideration."

01:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Exactly."

01:09 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "So noted."

01:09 Ather clears his throat as he continues.

01:10 Lily looks hopeful.

01:10 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Meanwhile, I have been having some discussions with some of the members of the Mutuality. Nothing has been decided, but I did try to talk to them trying to see what kinds of things would help this sort of situation. All of this pretty much brings me here tonight. The guarantee issue we just covered thankfully, but this next one is one we will have to consider, if we want to continue these negotiations."

01:10 Eli frowns thoughtfully.

01:11 Lily looks rather pensive.

01:11 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I'll put it to you all straight. The Mutuality believes that at present, we have nothing that we can really offer them. No need for them to reopen the QSA to our pilots. They believe that due to the threat posed by the AEU navy, they would have more to lose than to gain if they opened up the QSA to us. Even if the government offerred them the guarantee of no hostilities, they are not sure that they can trust it, because of the current admbecause of current tensions in the AEU."

01:11 Constantine Stone nods.

01:11 Constantine Stone says, "I guess I wouldn't blame them."

01:11 You nod and frown.

01:11 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Before any of you start spouting the usual line about spending credits in their territories, let me tell you, that is hardly of any concern to them. You can spend all the credits you want and believe that you're contributing to what passes for their economy etc. However, if the AEU navy decided to attack their space, people spending money at their stations and giving their economy a boost will be their last concern, to be honest."

01:12 Eli Grey nods.

01:12 You nod. "That does make sense."

01:12 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Let's face it. As things stand, they have more to offer us than we do them. It is a position I had hoped to avoid, but it is the honest truth. So, my question is this."

01:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I certainly wouldn't with our Rogue Navy in Tandem the other day and for other reasons."

01:12 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "The Mutuality is already aware that we have, as an alliance, broken all ties with Fleet Admiral Janus."

01:12 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "An attack by her is not an attack by the AEu navy. They know this."

01:12 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Anyway."

01:13 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "The question."

01:13 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I have been monitoring general alliance chatter. There has been a general amount of concern from civilian pilots who worry that they cannot get their tactical platforms, as well as the Farport technologies. I have my opinions about all of this, but those are not what we're here to discuss."

01:13 You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:13 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "As your voice, I want to know what you, the pilots want, because let me tell you, if you guys want the skim gates to be re-opened to us, there might be some work ahead of us."

01:14 Eli Grey nods. "Of course."

01:14 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "So, the floor is open for some respectful discussion, unless you have something you want to add, Miss Richard?"

01:14 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:14 "Not at this time. This is your meeting." Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard smiles.

01:14 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Delightful."

01:15 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Anyone want to add anything?"

01:15 Constantine Stone says, "Well, I'll say one thing."

01:15 Constantine Stone says, "I know I've bellyached about not being able to rent a platform or access Farport."

01:15 Constantine Stone says, "Those things are nice, but I don't necessarily thing access to them is worth opening every can of worms."

01:15 Constantine Stone says, "Depending on how far we have to bend over backwards to get access back."

01:16 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "You aren't the only one who has. Which is why I wanted to hold this meeting. To be honest, I don't know how far we might have to bend backwards, though I might have an idea."

01:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I do because it is the only well-equipped Exploration starship that we can obtain."

01:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'when configured of course."

01:16 Constantine Stone says, "I think we can make do if we need to make do, is all I'm saying."

01:17 Eli Grey says, "Is simply trying to do a non-aggression pact with skim access included out of the question? It sounds liek that's what they really want."

01:17 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods.

01:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As most AEU pilots are dedicated explorers."

01:18 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Well, let me put this into perspective. Mind you, this is jus tan example."

01:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:18 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "What if the Mutuality wanted access to the blueprints for a certain ship. Doesn't matter what ship, but any ship, as long as they can have a hope of remaining on even footing in case of an attack."

01:19 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "What then? From all of you?"

01:19 Constantine Stone says, "I don't like that, personally."

01:19 Eli grimaces.

01:19 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods to Constantine Stone.

01:19 I don't understand that.

01:19 I don't understand that.

01:19 You wince.

01:19 Lily looks hesitant and doubtful.

01:19 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Your reactions pretty much mirror mine at the very thought."

01:19 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I'm not a fan of this idea either. Ships are just an example. It could honestly be anything."

01:20 Constantine Stone nods.

01:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:20 You nod. "Right."

01:20 Constantine Stone says, "But I think that's a logical expectation."

01:20 Constantine Stone says, "Or something like that. A piece of military tech, maybe."

01:20 Constantine Stone says, "And this is what I'd consider too much."

01:20 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Now, let's make it a slightly lesser extreme. Access to the revo and the Telex Jackrabbit, which a lot of them would definitely secretly love to have back."

01:20 Johnathon Triggs says, "Think i've said this before... might've been on our trip. Weapons to other alliances, of our own, should be out of the question. Defenses, on the other hand, is someting else."

01:20 Eli Grey asks, "Is that the kind of thing it took for the last skim treaty or non-aggression pact?"

01:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well they sure have their eyes on our battery."

01:21 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Part of the skim treaty involved a sharing of technologies."

01:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Pierre once told me so."

01:21 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "The non-aggressio npact encouraged more of the sharing of technologies, but there was some with the QSA access as well."

01:21 Eli Grey nods and grins. "Yeah, everyone loves the Revo."

01:21 You nod.

01:21 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Things like the farport upgrades, the tactical platform, those were all aprt of the QSA treaty."

01:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Otherwise I don't think there's... well I know they'd love our Combat ships."

01:22 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Things like the jackrabbit, the revo, those were more a part of the non-aggression pact of the treaty."

01:22 Constantine Stone asks, "So when we had non-agression, they did have access to those?"

01:22 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Right."

01:22 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Just like the league and the fringe presently do."

01:22 Constantine Stone nods.

01:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And our battlesuit but they don't care much forit."

01:23 Johnathon nods slowly, listening.

01:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But they should."

01:23 Constantine Stone says, "Well, if they used to have access to those things, I don't suppose there would be a big problem with offering it again."

01:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.

01:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sure they'd like our Constructor too."

01:24 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "So honestly that's where we're at. My belief is that we might have to do some sort of technology exchange; maybe revo, or telex jackrabbit, or both for the QSA access and the sharing of technologies like the Farport upgrades."

01:24 Eli Grey asks, "I'm guessing there's credits made thre too? They only had access to sell those things, we were still producing them, correct?"

01:24 Ather says to Lily, "I very much doubt they care about the constructor."

01:24 You say, "Probably, butI don't think anyone else has acess to the constructor."

01:24 You say, "Access."

01:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Right well that's true that's something only alllied would get most likely."

01:25 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, you mean we'd have to give the Revo up for less than a non-aggression pact with them."

01:25 Constantine Stone says, "That makes sense."

01:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Constantine Stone.

01:25 Ather says to Eli, "Well, we wouldn't give it to them, we'd just allow their pilots to purchase them, if the AEU government sanctioned the deal."

01:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Which I'd be in favor of."

01:25 Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:26 Constantine Stone says, "I guess I don't love the idea of giving them more for less like that."

01:26 Constantine Stone says, "But it may be our only option."

01:26 Eli Grey says, "It also sounds like it will be a non-aggression pact without being a non-aggression pact? That's the part I think I'm having trouble with."

01:26 Constantine Stone says, "No, this will just be for skim access."

01:26 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "As you've noted, non-aggression pacts tend to come with component sharing agreements by default. Not sharing the blueprints, so to speak, but providing access to them for purchase."

01:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "In all fairness, we've been obtaining more from them for the past few years than they have from us other than having access to the Skims."

01:27 Constantine says to Lily, "That's a good point."

01:27 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "So you all would be in favor of giving them access to one, the other or both of these technologies for QSA access, and access to the stuff we use to have with it? In addition to a Mutuallly-agreed upon guarantee from both sides of no hostilities?"

01:27 You nod to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.

01:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:27 Constantine says to Ather, "I would be in favor of that."

01:27 You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.

01:27 Ather nods slowly, rubbing his chin with a hand.

01:27 Constantine says to Ather, "Would you?"

01:28 You ask, "Maybe we should put it up for a vote on the voting machine?"

01:28 Constantine Stone nods.

01:28 Eli Grey says, "Wouldn't give us much to work with if we ever wanted to get an actual Non-aggression pact later."

01:28 Ather says to Constantine, "I'm trying to get an idea of what the alliance pilots want before attempting negotiations. My opinions don't matter at the moment."

01:28 Constantine says to Eli, "That's also a good point."

01:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or we could just agree here with all of us who are assembled."

01:28 Constantine Stone says, "I think a formal vote couldn't hurt the process."

01:28 Ather says to Lily, "But we're not the only pilots in the corps."

01:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I agree was just suggesting."

01:28 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Therefore, a proposal is warrented, and one will go up after the meeting. Good thought."

01:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do believe a vote is more democratic."

01:29 Constantine Stone says, "Eli's point is a good one."

01:29 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "What I am trying to say is that if you plan to negotiate a non-aggression pact, component sharing is already assumed. It cannot then also be exchanged for gate access. Unless you plan to negotiate non-standard terms."

01:29 Constantine Stone says, "Right, but I think Ather is currently proposing only a gate access agreement."

01:30 Constantine Stone says, "Unless I'm mistaken."

01:30 Ather says to Antoinette, "The Mutuality are a complicated entity. Based on the reactions of the pilots here, it seems that negotiating with them should be done, and we may have to negotiate non-standard terms."

01:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes but I honestly belive a NAP with Mutuality is very ver far away and regretfully so."

01:30 Ather says to Constantine, "I can see what we can get out of it, but likely we will not get more than QSA access, if even that."

01:30 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Very well."

01:30 Constantine Stone nods.

01:30 You nod.

01:31 Lily nods slowly.

01:31 Constantine Stone says, "Unfortunately it may just take time to rebuild trust."

01:31 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Basically, we're going to have to work our way up, but that just goes back to how far you all want to bend over backwards. I'll be perfectly frank."

01:31 Constantine Stone nods.

01:31 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "We're going very non-standard with this suggestion."

01:31 You nod.

01:32 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe start with just one of the revo or jackrabbit."

01:32 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "We're in a unique position due to current situations, and we're just going to have to play the cards we're dealt. It's pretty much a pair of 5's right now. Not much better than that. We just have to make sure that they don't have a set of cards higher than that one."

01:32 You nod and nod.

01:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "During each meeting of the Council where I have been present, they stress over and over again that we don't have much to offer them. However this last meeting was certainly the concern that the AEU would not act aggressively towards them and what would we do as polots to get this through to our Government. And I agree ather."

01:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Pilots that is."

01:33 Ather opens his mouth to speak, shrugs, closes it and glances around for a moment before speaking again.

01:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident looks at Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa thoughtfully.

01:34 Ather turns to the negotiators and asks, "was there anything that seemed to specifically peek their interest?"

01:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just as I said, that We, the AEU would not attack the Mutuality."

01:34 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods.

01:34 Ather says to Antoinette, "A question."

01:35 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard asks, "Yes?"

01:35 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:35 You say, "That was the amin concern."

01:35 You say, "Main."

01:37 Ather hesitates for a moment before asking, "let's say we negotiate a hypothetical treaty with the Mutuality, and both sides agreed to the no hostilities. As a token of good faith, since I don't expect an honorable government such as ours to break their word, would the government possibly sanction an addition that said that the AEU pilots would fight against our own navy in the event that they did attack first? As I said, this would be a token suggestion, which would likely never need to be put into effect."

01:37 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "It does sound bad, it's true."

01:37 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "But."

01:37 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "If we stuck to our word, which I feel confident we would do."

01:37 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "It's no sacrifice on anyone's part."

01:37 Lily nods emphaticlaly.

01:39 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Under no circumstances would this government, or, I imagine, any government, approve a treaty that sanctions treason and... well, effectively, civil war."

01:39 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I figured as much."

01:39 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Bending that far backward would've made any pilot uncomfortable, I'd imagine."

01:39 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods.

01:39 Constantine Stone nods.

01:39 Johnathon Triggs nods.

01:40 Eli nods solemnly.

01:40 Eli Grey takes a sip of a large mug of hot black coffee with cream and sugar.

01:40 You nod.

01:41 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Alright. Well, with regards to the Mutuality thing, all that really remains, is to put up the proposal detailing what we discussed in the negotiations. Unless someone else has anything to add, I suppose we can press onward and forward."

01:41 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Does anyone have anything else to add?"

01:41 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "In relation to the Mutuality?"

01:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shakes her head.

01:41 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:41 Eli Grey says, "No, I suppose not."

01:41 You shake your head.

01:42 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Alright. Well then, on to my next topic."

01:42 Ather gestures to a patriotically painted donations box.

01:43 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Mis Richard, while we have you here, if you please! We have been wanting to use this donation box for several things. Including providing a relief fund for citizens who cannot afford the use of medical creches, to a fund-raising effort for the victims of the 9/24 crashes."

01:43 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "But, based on previous records, inquiries about that have gone mostly unanswered."

01:44 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "While well-intentioned, such efforts might draw more attention to the role civilian pilots played in that attack."

01:44 Eli looks down at the floor.

01:44 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Perhaps you're right, when it comes to the latter attack, but what about the former thing, which is not really related to civilian pilots?"

01:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:46 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:46 Johnathon Triggs says, "That's not a bad idea..."

01:47 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "It's a possibility, though I suspect President Best will prefer that work to be done via an entity already in the health care market rather than a fund that the government would control."

01:47 Johnathon Triggs says, "The medical creche, idea, that is."

01:47 Lily looks rather frustrated and curiously towards the Donations Box.

01:48 Constantine Stone says, "But just in general, would it be possible to get a donations box that we're able to create funds for on the fly? Or are you saying that this would be something that could be too easily misused."

01:48 Constantine Stone says, "Like I know we've collected donations for Hyperion in the past."

01:48 Constantine Stone says, "And things like that."

01:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Honestly we's prefer that these funds are targetted towards a worthy cause which we as pilots may contribute towards for good will."

01:48 Eli Grey says, "Maybe a donation proposal has to be voted on before it starts receiving donations."

01:48 Eli Grey shrugs.

01:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'we actually did while I was Voice of the Corps and it passed."

01:49 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:49 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

01:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I don't know when this donations box was established but those funds have been just sitting there for what... years?"

01:50 Eli Grey says, "A long time yes, and the asteroid feild it was for turned out to be in a bad spot. I believe soem of those funds have already been spent though."

01:51 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Yes, to my knowledge, those funds have long been disbursed."

01:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh ok well then they do need to be put to some good purpose."

01:51 Eli Grey nods. "It would be nice though, for us to have some way of contributing donations to help the other citizens."

01:52 Eli Grey finishes off a large mug of hot black coffee with cream and sugar.

01:52 Johnathon Triggs asks, "How about funds for 'planetary defense research'? To possiblely.. avoid any further catastrophic events?"

01:53 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Well, as I said, I think the only way forward with health care donations would be to identify a... caretaker to disburse the funds."

01:53 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:53 Constantine Stone asks, "Like perhaps if we donated to Garner care?"

01:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I believe they should go toward humanitary aid."

01:54 Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:54 Ather says to Lily, "The funds that are in the box already have already been given out to the previous project which they were intended for."

01:54 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "That's just a number to signify how much was donated. The credits are not actually there any longer."

01:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I have donated since I became a pilot."

01:55 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa approaches a patriotically painted donations box.

01:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps others have since."

01:55 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Garnercare is a term applied to a government program which subsidized the use of regenerative therapy. The National Patriots believe this can be done more efficiently by those already familiar with the health care market."

01:56 Constantine Stone says, "I see."

01:57 Lily says to Antoinette, "Yes I'm sure our family's medical services has but just wanted to promote something for us as pilots to give towards.... Too bad."

01:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "My family's that is."

01:58 Evangeline Adaire opens the door.

01:58 Evangeline Adaire glides in from the south.

01:58 You nod to Evangeline Adaire.

01:58 Evangeline Adaire sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:58 Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.

01:58 Ather says to Antoinette, "Thank you for clarifying. Well, we can get this donation box removed so that no one can get the wrong idea in future and donate to a survey expedition that has been long completed. However, it would be nice if we could get a more customizeable donation box in the event that we might find a lucritive venture to donate for. The fund centers prove a bit unreliable, since we can't control who withdraws."

01:58 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa closes the door.

01:58 Evangeline Adaire walks in quietly and doesn't say a word sitting down quietly as she pushes a hand through her hair. She nods to those who nod to her, though otherwise does nothing else.

01:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:58 Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:58 Eli Grey says, "Yeah."

01:58 I don't see that here.

01:58 You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

01:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As the funds I contributed are dormant."

01:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Not that they were sizable."

01:59 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Does anyone else have any topics they want to bring up before we conclude this meeting?"

01:59 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Yes. As I say, you may still find a way to contribute. Just understand that President Best is unlikely to approve of expanding the government's role in the health care market."

01:59 Eli Grey says, "I'd like to ask something yes."

01:59 Ather says to Antoinette, "So noted."

01:59 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.

02:00 Eli says to Ather, "Now that the outccord negotiations are finished, has there been any word on what kind of changes we can expect to see in the corps?"

02:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So what's the role of charities then?"

02:00 Eli Grey says, "Everything still seems normal to me, that's the only reason I'm asking."

02:00 Ather directs the question to Antoinette by saying, "Mis Richard?"

02:01 Ather says to Eli, "Well, it will take a month or two to finish up everything."

02:01 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "But I am fairly sure someone said no more geminis down the line."

02:01 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I'm sure Mis Richard will clarify further."

02:01 Shule frowns deeply.

02:01 Eli Grey nods. "Yeah, it was said that was a possibility."

02:01 Evangeline frowns a little.

02:01 Johnathon frowns.

02:01 Ather directs his attention back to Antoinette.

02:01 Evangeline Adaire asks, "I actually like my gemini... Will our ships that we own be taken from us, then?"

02:02 Constantine Stone says, "I doubt it. They're not rented, after all."

02:02 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "You should expect to shift your wider efforts of defending humanity from coordination by the Accord to a program closer to home. That is all I can say at this time. Speaking practically, little else is likely to change right away."

02:02 Eli Grey furrows his brow.

02:02 Eli Grey nods to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard. "Thank you."

02:02 Shule looks pensive.

02:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well this is very unfortunate too because of possible encounters with a certain Ifs category."

02:02 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Your existing geminis are already paid for and fully owned by yourself and your government."

02:04 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods.

02:04 Evangeline shrugs her shoulders, leaning back in her seat.

02:04 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Will there be something else for us, as AEU, to replace the lose of Geminis?"

02:04 Ather says to Antoinette, "My cruiser is presently on loan to the Accord for an operation. What's to become of that?"

02:04 You nod.

02:04 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "To answer the other question, charities are private organizations subject to specific regulations. They are not run by the government either."

02:05 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "That's actually very good to know."

02:05 Antoinette says to Ather, "That's a good question. I'll have to look into that, but I assume the government will expect to have those ships released back to you."

02:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm aware but they often assist with certain humnitarian aid."

02:05 Constantine says to Lily, "I think what she's saying is that pilot-driven donation funds are government funds, and the government doesn't want to be involved in this issue."

02:05 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "You are welcome to find a charity that will work with you."

02:05 Ather says to Antoinette, "Is it possible for the Accord to retain use of that cruiser until the conclusion of the operation?"

02:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That's a good idea actually."

02:07 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "It's a possibility, though I'm not sure how much either side will want to retain that sort of tie."

02:07 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Well, if my word counts, I would like that to be the case."

02:07 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Until the conclusion of the operation."

02:08 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "I will pass along your wishes, but I can't make any promises."

02:08 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Fair enough."

02:09 Johnathon frowns for a moment in thought.

02:10 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Anyone else with anything?"

02:11 Constantine Stone says, "I had two things."

02:11 Lily slowly shakes her head.

02:11 Eli Grey looks at Constantine Stone thoughtfully.

02:11 Constantine says to Antoinette, "Ms. Richard, we previously discussed the releasing of reports about the exact total physical damages caused in the crashes."

02:11 Constantine Stone asks, "Have the reports been compiled yet, and if so, can they be released to us?"

02:12 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "I'll deliver those reports when they're ready for release."

02:12 Constantine Stone nods.

02:12 Constantine Stone says, "Thank you."

02:12 Constantine Stone says, "And secondly..."

02:13 Constantine sighs and looks down at his hands, drumming his fingers quietly on the table.

02:13 Constantine Stone says, "I've had disagreements with the government."

02:13 Constantine Stone says, "Explosive ones."

02:13 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

02:13 Constantine Stone says, "And if I can prevent anyone from making the same mistakes I have, I want to."

02:13 Constantine Stone says, "The Hyperion separatists have legitimate concerns, surely."

02:13 Constantine Stone says, "But their way isn't the way."

02:13 Constantine Stone asks, "Is there anything we can do?"

02:14 Constantine looks around the table. "I mean to ask this of all of us, do we have any ideas?"

02:14 Constantine says to Antoinette, "And maybe more specifically, do you know if the patrols are accomplishing anything besides intimidating the populace?"

02:15 Eli shakes his head sadly.

02:15 Constantine Stone asks, "Has any actionable intelligence been gleaned from them?"

02:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I wish I did except that I don't believe in violence towards anyone even if we so opposed to their point of view."

02:15 Constantine Stone nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "And I'm not advocating violence against them."

02:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I also am not in favor of our patrolling the streets as it is too intimmidating of innocent citizens and this, absolutely is not what battlesuits are intended for."

02:16 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "I'm not privy to military intelligence, but I know that those patrols are meant to help keep the peace."

02:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But we are not Law Enforcement."

02:17 Johnathon Triggs removes a gleaming set of handcuffs from a small cloth sack.

02:17 Eli Grey blinks.

02:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances at Johnathon Triggs.

02:17 Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "You're also not navy, not miners, and not merchants, but you fill many roles when called upon, as defined in the contract you signed when you joined the civilian corps."

02:18 Johnathon Triggs nods to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.

02:18 Constantine Stone says, "I think what Johnathon means to indicate is that we can and do enforce laws."

02:18 Lily looks at the door.

02:18 Lily eyes flash in anger.

02:18 Johnathon Triggs says, "Mis Richards just basically said what I was about to say."

02:18 Johnathon Triggs grins.

02:19 Johnathon Triggs puts a gleaming set of handcuffs in a small cloth sack.

02:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps within reason but intimmidating citizens is not ethical."

02:20 Johnathon says to Lily, "Battlesuits are for our own protection.."

02:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If we're called upon to aide with specific incidents, then yes but patroling streets is..."

02:21 Johnathon says to Lily, "It's a deterant."

02:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident frowns at Johnathon Triggs.

02:21 Ather raises a hand.

02:21 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "We can debate this all night."

02:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.

02:21 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "We all have our viewpoints."

02:22 Johnathon says to Lily, "I know. I'm being the devils advocate. But, I'm trying to see the other side of it."

02:22 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I choose not to do those patrols."

02:22 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Whether you do or not is up to you."

02:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Same here."

02:22 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "And that's the end of that."

02:22 Evangeline Adaire says, "I choose not to do them either."

02:22 Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Anything else?"

02:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I also do not support them through the GSL office."

02:22 Constantine Stone says, "That was all I had, at any rate."

02:22 Constantine Stone says, "Thank you."

02:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Let's pick up the slack on completed beacon drops, folks. We've only done 11 out of 60 total."

02:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We get the idea."

02:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Did Shule get aressted on purpose to come to your rescue?"

02:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well erem."

02:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Naa the poor guy was fast asleep!"

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So those bastards arrested him too in his sleep for the stars sake!"

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh wow, I guess that's why they cleared out his robot from the mail room."

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, can we not tell everyone else from the other alliance about who it was?"

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Please?"

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought that robot belonged in there."

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah would appreciate it as I have never done that nor will likely. We all have our absent-minded moments you know?"

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am glorious philanthropist of discreteness."

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I think some of them already know, from what i've heard."

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "How would they as neither of us have shared."

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "This is the absolute first time this has been shared."

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well Ather already knew."

02:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "No idea. I know Morris was speaking about it not to long ago."

02:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "At any rate I was held for 6 hours and I guess Shule had a couple of hours to serve. I don't know precisely."

02:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Surprised there wasn't any tabloids on it."

02:36 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "He also hit on anything which resembled a woman."

02:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Except you, Lily."

02:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "At least, I don't think he hit on you."

02:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, been a long time since I seen that guy."

02:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes he did before we met."

02:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, figures."

02:40 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

02:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

02:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:44 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:44 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

02:44 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:44 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:44 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Haunted Reveries" has jumped into the sector.

02:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:44 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."

02:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:45 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Worst case is sell it if they are still available after the breech."

02:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:46 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is one reason I'm not letting my scout or modular transporter go."

02:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

02:46 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:43 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, I'm not actually sure how much control the Fringe government has over the news sources, but in the League and the AEU it's much like the United States or other "free" countries in our current world. News is corporate. They get the story out, no matter what the government thinks."

15:44 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "There are ways that Fringe news can get out too, but, the Fringe government is often the one that puts this kind of news out anyway, we need to know a certain amount about military things in particular."

15:44 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Even if the fringe was as sensored as north Korea, which I majorly doubt, they'd still report on things that made them look good. Bringing down a massive outsider mothership makes them look good."

15:45 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Exactly, the Fringe takes a lot of pride in this kind of thing."

15:45 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Pretty much Erik. So unless your char was in some odd survivalist group or something with no access to news, this stuff would be known to them. But fear not! We know new players (cadets) don't know these things, so it's something we generally gloss over."

15:46 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I just wanted you to know where you could find the things that your char should already know for the future."

15:46 [Newbie Help] Thalia Wishheart transmits, "Of course thank you."

15:46 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "And as Morris said, that's what all the introductory and background help files are there for, and they've done a lot of work on them the last few months."

18:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh.. ok."

18:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then yes, dock it and go home."

18:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, that's not what I was wondering. I was wondering I could dock a mule, into another carrier.. logistically.."

18:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you can."

18:01 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

18:01 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

18:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "A carrier that was rift capable. And good battery usage."

18:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But..."

18:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "From what I hear.. not to many carriers have good battery usage for what I was thinking.."

18:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thinking of looking for nests out of comms range?"

18:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "No... more if a Mule would function at the GMG."

18:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It will not."

18:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "AH... well then."

18:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The aerial fortress has a different purpose that makes it mostly unuseable on a glyphmaker station."

18:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was afraid of that."

18:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You need aspecialized ship with a launch tube."

18:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So, pretty much.. just gems."

18:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Fortunately you can ride in someone else's."

18:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Right."

18:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Well.. lets hope I can get done all I need to get done, to be able to get a gem.. before things 'conclude'..."

18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Which... isn't too unreasonable to do."

18:07 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.

18:36 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Is there a syntax for viewing uncharted sectors with the SDC terminal?"

18:36 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can't as far as I know."

18:36 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Only beaconed sectors that are League or have a League ship in them."

18:37 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well...your alliance I mean. But since you're League..."

18:38 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Alright. I thought there might be a way considering you get messages about what's going on."

18:38 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not that I'm aware of."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "How long does the transfer of the salvage take from out at 777, usually?"

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Quite a while."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would estimate about 20 minutes."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Earlier today I turned in a load and had time to fill up a second time and transfer before the pod returned."

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah. So about the time it would or will take to recharge my hauker."

18:45 You can't go that way.

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hauler."

18:45 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wal
18:45 l-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

18:48 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Power has to be on for a ship to recharge out at temp stations?"

18:48 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yeah."

18:48 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Kind of odd.."

18:48 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not really."

18:49 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you want it to charge faster, cut some systems...just be sure to power down and then turn them back on before you launch."

18:53 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

18:55 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

18:57 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

19:00 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

19:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hmm don't know when we can't cross the Skim."

19:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see. Where would we normally depart from to get there?"

19:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I use Thousand Storms."

19:05 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

19:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ugh i'm not awake now am I you said Feng Wo haha."

19:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It is roughly 39 LTC to Andy's Trading Post and over 65 LtC from that point to Feng Wo."

19:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Give or take of course."

19:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I was thinking you were saying NQ when you weren't."

19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see. I need to get that book that explains cyclic time. How make days is that?"

19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oops."

19:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I never measured it in days because we don't generally just go there and you would need enough charge if you're going to travel straight to Feng Wo so let's see..."

19:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You'd need s shp which generally has a Blast Chamber if you're oging straight there."

19:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Woo... wow. That's a lo~.of;points{"

19:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What about going to Andy's first?"

19:12 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

19:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Could you make that trip in a carrier, or would 36 hours not be enough to get you there?"

19:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And if you're lucky, I'd say around 3 days in a Galleon, platform or Science Vesel and this is form andy's so it would require probably aobut 12 hours form 274 to get to Andy's then charge up and go."

19:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, I see."

19:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So getting from Andy's to Feng Wo in a carrier would be impossible."

19:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Without something to extend your charge beyond just the Feinstein battery."

19:22 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

19:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That was faster to return than the other day.."

19:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It all depends on which way the wind is blowing."

19:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah. I got lucky this time."

19:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It was blowing reallly good, too."

You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

19:30 You can't go that way.

19:30 I don't understand that.

19:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where are all the RATS?"

19:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

19:37 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

19:41 You stroke the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo.

19:41 Shine the big white glowing felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

You can go south and out.

19:41 I can't find "sofa."

19:41 I don't understand that.

19:41 You can't go that way.

19:41 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

19:46 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

19:56 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

19:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I still don't quite understand the propsal. If we are going to have a mutual agreement of no aggressions, as well as offering technologies, then isn't this really a non-aggression pact with skim access on the table?"

19:58 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

19:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "In my oppinion, pretty much..."

19:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Bleh. I can't talk today."

19:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well as you know, the QSA provided for the other provisions we had. We're just trying to tive more but we'll likely not see a NAP for a long long time ifever."

19:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Since a non-aggression pact is, at it's heart, a mutal agreement of no aggressions. Iunderstand that there are some other differences..."

19:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Give more that is."

19:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Think it's already been said that some parties, do not, can not trust other parties at their word."

19:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It just sorta feels like loss of the skims was because we had no diplomatic relations to begin with, I suppose I will go along with this but it just feels like we should be trying for a non-aggression pact instead of just skim access, since a pact is what they really want."

19:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Many many times."

20:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think there's any rule that says we have to do one before the other."

20:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Probably not but we have less in their opinion to offer than they to us."

20:02 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well yes, which is why we're apparently consdiering offering up the revo and the jackrabbit, but since what they really want is just a garunteee that we won't attack, couldn't we offer the revo and jackrrabbit in exchange for a non-aggression pact instead?"

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I mean if we are offering a non-agression part of a skim-access deal, they'll never even have an incentive to do a pact later, since they'll already have it in another form."

20:03 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 164,185.19 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

20:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well such as it is as I say, I doubt we'll achieve a NAP in it's true form. We've been trying since I became a pilot and failed for one reason or another."

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My understanding is that a non-aggression pact would give them the revo and jackrabbit anyway."

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that wrong?"

20:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, precisely."

20:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's kind of my point."

20:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you guys think trading them the revo and the jackrabbit will make them trust us more?"

20:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's not that I'm worried about them having those components, more that we will be screwing ourselves out of ever acheiving a non-aggression pact. As they will have the components and the agreement of not attacking already in their skim treaty."

20:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think we need to rebuild trust, but I'm not sure trading those pieces of tech away is going to accomplish that."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It sort of seems like we're trading them away for the convenience of having farport access."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It's a gesture of good faith. It's a start."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess if they don't trust us, they probably won't accept the deal anyway."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know, I might vote against it."

20:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm very confident I'll be one of only two or three though."

20:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So the measure will probably pass."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I worry about them thinking we are trying to be shfity too. Like trying to get a non-aggression pact without actually making one."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "To be frank, I don't trust certain.. er.. the currant situation, myself. I can understand them turning it down."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There's far more involved than just access to farport I don't have time to go into it right now but that's just one aspect."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's convenience for us involved."

20:21 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

20:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We don't need any of it to survive though, do we?"

20:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

20:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks heavily and then dozes off.

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unless you mean to say we might need the skim as an escape route."

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I guess could be a valid point."

20:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No as I say there's far more and I simply must go now."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "She just means more stuff, Constantine."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's what I figured."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it's just stuff."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Agnarrs ships, and suits, scoops."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "We can still get suits. Just need... a ride over."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Even if we couldn't, we don't need rental suits to do our jobs."

20:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No Johnathon we have not had access to Mutuality suits for a few years."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I went in to vote, but decided to come back out and think about it for a few more hours first."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "He means Agnarr's rental suits."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, those. Yeah."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "He's talking about the rentals."

20:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Also we don't ahve access to thousand Storms which is higher tritium rate."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would be happy to signal to them that we don't intend to attack them."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just don't think a bribe with our best tech is a great way to do it."

20:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes but you guys keep saying suits I'm just pointing out aspects to you newer pilots."

20:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We also can't go to NQ anymore or GMG."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nor do I, Constantine. But, to be able to use the Skim, I can see a trade."

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes but Lily, we must argue with you, it's standard policy."

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, like I said, I'm very confident it will pass."

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not unless we Rift over there."

20:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Have a good evening."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh you too Lily."

20:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks heavily and then dozes off.

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like if they want non-aggression, that's reasonable. But they should have to give us that, too, and that means all our tech is shared anyway."

20:28 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

20:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ms. Richard did say she believed the government would consider it."

20:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If non-aggression is really what the council wants, they should consider it as well."

20:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How did we lose non-aggression with them to begin with?"

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I believe it started with the slaver thing."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If I can guess... it was due to some very "intellegent" AEU pilots.."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Really?"

20:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well I don't think it was the strongest relations before that, but I believe that was the first time we lost the pact completely."

20:36 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

20:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Weren't league pilots involved in that scandal, too?"

20:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, in fact the League pilot who is still at large had more to do with it than most. But it was an AEU run trip."

20:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, I see."

20:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What.. exactly happened?"

20:46 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

20:48 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

20:49 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 285,750.44 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

20:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My understanding is that the crew got stuck somewhere on Feng Wo or something and had to raise money to pay a fine."

20:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And did this by trading in slaves, or something like that."

20:50 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Who were responsible?"

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know, this was way before my time. I only heard this third or fourth hand."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know any names."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd be surprised if any of them are still pilots."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, me too."

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They weren't even stuck, they just would have had to leave without their robots, as they'd been confiscated. The pilots except for the League pilot, are all in prison."

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can watch the whole trial on the Holo Johnathon, though it's in 3 parts."

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How did he avoid going to prison?"

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Was he just never apprehended?"

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, Feldmen is stil at large."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So what's interesting from where I'm sitting is that the League never brought its responsible pilot to justice, and they have an alliance with the Mutuality."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I want to say not hard. Space is very vast.."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We've locked ours up for life, and we have nothing with them. This can't be the source of the friction between us."

20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The League pilots though, actually ent an obtained evidence of the thing, and also managed to free two of the slaves."

20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, I see."

20:57 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

21:00 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

21:01 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

21:02 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"

21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That was just the catalyst though. AEU Mutuality relations have never been top notch, due to other things in the past."

21:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Then the um.. other thing happened while I was gone, with someone threatening to draw outsiders to Mutuality space. I believe they intitiated relations again after that just to revoke them."

21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... that's what I thought cased it."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's a trust issue really. The way the slaver pilots hid what they did so well, made the government unable to act, and when they finally did it just seemed like they were covering it up or something at first. That's not the case at all, the pilots were prosecuted fully. But you know things are sometimes when we're talking about the way things are,  and the way they seem."

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "It wouldn't have gone that way if I could have just gotten those ladies to act." Eli Grey sighs. "They genuinely wanted to do something but they were kinda frozen by fear. At least that's all I could come up with, I told them several times to do something, anything at all to try and fix it."

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What ladies?"

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nadira at least made a public statement denouncing slavery, that was something. It wasn't enough in the end but at least it was something other than just hiding in a ship and crying their eyes out."

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The ones involved in the slaver thing, at least two of them."

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "One of them was my fucking girlfriend."

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "How did they get found out in trading slaves?"

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, which one?"

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nadira?"

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, Kesi."

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn. She's in prison now?"

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, they all are. Probably for the rest of their lives gauging by how many years they have on their sentences."

21:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well Johnathon, the folks at Andy's informed ryland about it. He ended up showing up over new Earth shooting at ATher, because all he knew was that it was an invaders carrier that it happened on at the time. He assumed that Ather knew about it and was shooting at him and calling him a son of a bitch and stuff. It was all pretty intense."

21:12 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

21:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So is slavery illegal in all tandem pact space?"

21:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am sure that didn't go overly well.."

21:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What happened?"

21:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Several other things were traded, they were trying to get enough of the currency to get their robots back. At one point some slaves got offered and anotehr trader was looking for slaves, so they basically took a shortcut. Sadly, this is I believe the first instance of anyone actually trading at Andy's in this fashion."

21:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Next, that is."

21:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is slave trading legal at Andy's?"

21:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sounds a bit of a set up."

21:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, they were unsanctioned trades, though the pilots at the time did'nt know that."

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I'm somewhat surprised they got life in prison for breaking Union laws far outside Union space."

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if they broke tandem pact laws too, I guess that explains it."

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And I think that their not exactly illegal? But they would be under sanctioned trades."

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well they also traded a league Corvette at the start of the trades, to get it all going. That counts as arming an unregistered entity."

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "We're AEU pilots. Not rogue pilots or unreg pilots.. we have standards."

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think they all got liek ten years apiece, just for that one."

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We do, but does that mean I can go to prison for using a targeting computer bypass when I'm out of comms range?"

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Did they check common sense at the door or something?"

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Then I believe it was thirty years apiece for each count of slave trading, so they're all in there in a long time."

21:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think constantine, because you would still be using it in a Union ship while you are acting in a official capacity as a Union pilot. I could be wrong on that oe though."

21:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Interesting."

21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Think about it like this, If I fly out of comms range and then stab someone, I don't get away scott free just because I wasn't in anyone's space."

21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right."

21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I was thinking stabbing someone was legal where you went."

21:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if slavery is illegal at Andy's, then that explains it."

21:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey laughs. "No, never go to the stabby zone."

21:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Stabby zone is outsider space, right?"

21:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well ti's weird, because from what I understand, it's not exactly illegal either, or else they wouldn't have been openly doing it right there on the trading floor."

21:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

21:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I find curious about it."

21:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But, at the end of the day, don't enslave people."

21:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So it really shouldn't be a problem."

21:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, the legality of it hardly matters, it's the ethical part that's the real reason not to be doing it."

21:20 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It does matter a bit for their sentencing, which is why I was curious about it."

21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I really wish they could have gotten the girl back, the video clips don't paint a very pretty picture of where she was going."

21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And Feldmen was making a big joke out of it, fucking scumbag."

21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Like in the clip he says somethingl ike "got one girl here, she's naked and chained up real good" or something."

21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Were the victims in question from Demargas? Why did Ryland take this one trade, out of what I assume are many that occur frequently out in Tandem space, so personally?"

21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Moron."

21:22 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

21:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And from what I was told, the guy was like groping her and stuff liek she was a piece of meat."

21:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn."

21:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Was Feldman ever seen again?"

21:23 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the south.

21:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No they weren't from Demargas, they took it personally because they expect that kinda thing out of certain unreg clans and such, but not out of alliance pilots that are supposed to be friends."

21:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I'm fuzzy on the relations at play here. If it's commonplace at Andy's, is it not their own people doing it?"

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Andy's isn't Mutuality, it's part of the Feng wo trading collective."

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Their own people being tandem pact members."

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And that's separate from the tandem pact?"

21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, it is it's own thing. I don't believe they are part of the Tandem Pact."

21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Though I think they do have some sort of diplomatic relations witht he Mutuality, not sure how far that goes though."

21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Further than ours, I'd wager."

21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Seems you can do anything except whatever it is we do."

21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And be on okay terms with them."

21:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "At the time that it happened, no. We still had a non-aggression pact."

21:27 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

21:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, did Ather send Ryland home in a pod?"

21:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was hoping so.."

21:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

21:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No no, that would have just escalted things even further. He simply kept evading and trying to find out what was goign on."

21:31 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo curls up and closes its eyes.

21:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "None of us knew about the salve thing. Not even me, and I was on board the ship sleeping when it happened. I had been sick for most of the trip. I even came out and checked out the station a few hours afterwards and had no idea. I just walked around and checked things out then went back to sleep."

21:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There was a note that was left for me, about not brining my robots on board so they wouldn't be confiscated, and something about a fighter that had been let unlocked and gotten stolen, but tha'ts it."

21:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I know that Kesi believed, that since it was a League corvette that had been traded and since Feldmen did the trades himself, that it was going to be a League issue. But since it was her trip,  and since she had to undock the fighter for him it made her just as responsible."

21:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And since they had authorized him to trade on their behalf."

21:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The whoel thing was just stupid. They were just robots, they could have left them there and built new ones, or even just stayed a bit longer and got the currency without trading slaves. There was no reason why it all had to be done in that instant."

21:36 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

21:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if this happened today everyone on the trip would have been thrown in jail for touching an unreg."

21:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Johnathon, when you have time I highly recommend that you watch the trial. It's not an easy thing to watch but it's something that I think pilots should watch to sorta educated themselves on what not to do."

21:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not saying that you need to be told not to trade slaves, just more that it helps to see the real consequences of someone's actions. Alwyas use your head."

21:38 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

21:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I generally tend to use common sense when it comes to trading. Trade of Human life is just unthinkable."

21:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd like to get out to Feng Wo."

21:44 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

21:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And beyond."

21:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah me too, I've only ever been to Andy's and tom Town of Two Words."

21:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It sounds like Andy's can be reached in a carrier."

21:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh for sure."

21:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But Feng Wo sounds too far, even from Andy's."

21:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, you could make it to Feng wo in a carrier, just probably need a furnace on it though."

21:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

21:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Luckily they have repair stuff there, so you could get the furnace repaired."

21:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool."

21:46 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

22:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have they eased up on your point limits at all yet, John?"

22:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah. Finally."

22:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, great!"

22:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, when they did.. I had almost mit my max again with space combat and ground combat."

22:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

22:03 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on League Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the two-person light corvette "Sunset Theory".

22:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Need to take some time to work on industry."

22:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I could really use some scratch. I'm probably close to calling it a day, work wise, but if you want we can haul rocks tomorrow."

22:05 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Great, we've almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"

22:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Heh, sure."

22:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And with the relaxed caps I think there's probably a reactionless jet in your future, so we can go artifacting some time as well."

22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's what i'm gaming for."

22:10 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

22:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "On top of that, I'm hoping to grab a Gem before they become 'unavailable'."

22:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You should be able to do that, it has pretty light requirements."

22:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

22:14 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

22:16 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

22:24 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:34 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

22:40 [Tactical Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Pirate light gunboat in the belt of Orion."

22:40 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Need an assist or you good?"

22:40 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Need help?"

22:40 [Tactical Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Nah, just letting everyone know. They can stand around with their thumbs up their butts for all I care."

22:42 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:42 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Toll Station from the two-person medium transport "Sifter". The organization has earned 666,928.63 credits.

22:54 A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:54 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 285,762.99 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

23:01 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

23:05 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

23:13 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

23:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What suits do you got? And would you be able to pick me up at Tesla?"

23:19 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo jumps down from your lap.

23:20 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

23:22 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

23:24 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

23:31 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo jumps into Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's lap and settles in, purring.

23:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Out of interest, what is peoples strategy for rats in an AEU suit."

23:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What suits do we got on this Nest?"

23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Repair."

23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Repair."

23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Repair."

23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "If you are on your own.."

23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I don't mean nests... just rats in general."

23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah.. sec."

23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, you shouldn't do a nest completely by yourself."

23:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes Nests are intended for 4 or 5 people."

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Is an SVP nest?"

23:34 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I'm not doing a nest,. I'm doing an svp mission.."

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Laser them.. till they fall. then repair up. THen, rinse and repeat."

23:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, in that case, I usually used regen on myself and then just shot the rats with lasers and fully repaired afterwords."

23:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I gotcha. I need to get regen, how many points does it require?"

23:36 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

23:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I do. Regularly. Thanks lily."

23:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Like wow I'm not a walking enclyclopedia of points for everything."

23:37 You laugh.
