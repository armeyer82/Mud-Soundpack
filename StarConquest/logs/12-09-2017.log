00:16 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

00:20 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

00:20 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:21 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:51 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

00:51 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:10 The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and closing. It then abruptly swims off.

02:17 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

02:17 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

02:20 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

02:25 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders in from the south.

02:52 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Forward Observation]

02:52 A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a small light blue trash can, a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it, a blue plastic table, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a felo nutrigel dispenser unit, and a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe here.
You can go east, south, and west.

03:17 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:18 Elaine Moreau says, "I don't like yelling."

03:18 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:18 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

03:18 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

03:18 Melinda Michaels says, "Uh oh, it's war time."

03:19 Elaine Moreau says, "And people wonder why I don't like the Rift. I say I don't like yelling, so it starts a war. With yelling."

04:51 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Living Quarters Four]

04:51 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

04:51 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:51 You pull a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers off of your feet.

04:51 I see no "sneaekrs".

04:51 You put a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers in a leather briefcase.

04:56 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

04:58 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

05:00 Lily Kaise glides in from the west.

05:01 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:01 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

05:01 Lily Kaise pulls a pair of mystic purple suede clogs off of her feet.

05:01 Lily Kaise puts a pair of mystic purple suede clogs in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

05:01 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

05:01 You say to Lily, "Hi my love."

05:01 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:02 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:02 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

05:03 Lily gently rubs your back and strokes your hair.

05:03 You say to Lily, "You know I wouldn't have really done anything. I wont' flirt."

05:03 Lily Kaise says, "It's ok."

05:03 Lily Kaise grins at you.

05:03 Lily Kaise says, "I don't feel the least bit threatened by any of those women in there."

05:03 You grin.

05:04 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well may Nissi but Nissi is Godess of all!"

05:04 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:04 You exclaim, "You shouldn't feel threatened by any other woman. You will always be the best for me!"

05:04 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

05:04 Lily Kaise says, "Ok well I'm not worried even about Nissi. I'm just saying Nissi is the most awesomest one."

05:04 Lily Kaise grins.

05:04 You exclaim, "Oh gosh! I'm not going to flirt with Nissi and risk getting decked!"

05:05 You laugh.

05:05 Lily Kaise tickles you!

05:05 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:05 Lily Kaise exclaims, "As I said, I'm not worried!"

05:05 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:06 You say, "I'm not worried about any of the guys either."

05:06 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heck no!"

05:06 Lily Kaise says, "There aren't any of them that I'd um bother with."

05:06 "If you flirt too much with them." You laugh. "I'll just punish you. Just kidding!"

05:07 You grin at Lily Kaise.

05:07 Lily Kaise says, "The ones I might think about area already taken and I don't cross that line as I respect others relationships."

05:07 Lily Kaise says, "So I don't."

05:07 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:07 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:08 "Oh, like who?" You grin at Lily Kaise.

05:09 Lily Kaise says, "Well I don't' even want to discuss it as it's just not going to happen and even if they became available, I want what we have most of all."

05:09 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:09 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

05:09 You nod to Lily Kaise. "Well, I think I can guess one, but we won't talk about it as per your request."

05:09 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:10 You say to Lily, "You will always have me."

05:10 You say to Lily, "Unless you walk away from me."

05:11 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

05:11 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

05:12 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:12 Lily Kaise says, "Well I probably won'twalk away from you. I'd likely go back to keeping the borring financials of our family's assets and the businesses's books."

05:12 You say to Lily, "No matter what happens. I will always be first and foremost yours."

05:12 Lily Kaise beams at you.

05:12 Lily says to you, "Well that's the same for me."

05:14 You say to Lily, "I'm so so so sorry if the other day I made you feel like I'd prefer something over you. It was not my intent."

05:14 Lily Kaise says, "Ok well Love that is the other day. Let's just go forward."

05:15 Shule nods solemnly.

05:16 Lily says to you, "Love if you haven't figured it out about me, I don't like to dwell on things."

05:17 Shule nods understandingly, "I know. I'll deal with it."

05:18 You say, "Meaning, I'll get over it."

05:19 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

05:19 Lily says to you, "I love you."

05:19 You say to Lily, "I love you too!"

05:21 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:21 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:21 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:22 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

05:22 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

05:22 Lily Kaise says, "I sure wish I could interpret those words."

05:23 You nod to Lily Kaise.

05:25 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

05:28 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist.

05:28 Lily Kaise gently caresses your shoulders and back.

05:29 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

05:29 Lily says to you, "Yeah I hope so too."

05:29 Lily Kaise beams at you.

05:29 You beam at Lily Kaise.

05:30 "Until then." You grin at Lily Kaise. "Don't' mind me if I touch you... Umm, everywhere while you're asleep."

05:34 Lily Kaise giggles at you.

05:35 You grin at Lily Kaise. "Well, everywhere except your butt since you don't like that."

05:36 Lily Kaise asks, "That is so weird about the keys to this ship. I don't quite understand it why Morris has them?"

05:36 Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.

05:37 Lily Kaise says, "I mean, we're nt going to do anything illegal or damaging to melinda's ships."

05:37 Lily Kaise says, "Not tht is."

05:37 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:37 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:39 You say, "No idea."

05:39 You say, "She and Morris kind of have a weird relationship. She trust each other with their ships and such."

05:39 Lily Kaise says, "Ah well we just can't go outside to repair and we'll just have to get someone to take us in here when we need to come and go."

05:39 You nod.

05:40 You say, "Exactly."

05:40 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah... apparently."

05:40 You say, "I wouldn't trust him with my ships, but whatever."

05:40 Lily Kaise says, "I actually had a key to this ship for quite awhile and I never ever came aboard unless I was invited."

05:40 You nod.

05:40 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

05:40 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the neck.

05:41 Lily Kaise says, "Or I left something and if I did, I always told Melinda before I entered. I respet other's domain and their property."

05:46 You say to Lily, "I love you."

05:46 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:46 Lily says to you, "I so love you too!"

05:49 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders in from the west.

05:50 I don't see that here.

05:50 You stroke the soft fur of Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo.

05:50 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo purrs softly.

05:51 Kumquat the big red felo wanders in from the west.

05:52 Some people stumble by on the shore, their heads twisted around to face backwards.

05:52 Lily Kaise says, "Eww I don't cre much for this riftscap."

05:52 Lily Kaise says, "Care for this riftscape."

05:52 Lily covers her eyes.

05:53 You nod to Lily Kaise.

05:53 Lily Kaise says, "This stuff worries me at times. I think about the Jinu and I so worry tht they weren't tortured like this."

05:53 You say, "I don't blame you."

05:53 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Living Quarters Four]

05:53 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo, and Kumquat the big red felo here.

05:53 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders out.

05:54 Lily Kaise says, "I so hope that they have found comfort and sanctuary somewhere."

05:54 You nod to Lily Kaise.

05:55 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Kumquat the big red felo.

05:55 Kumquat the big red felo purrs softly.

05:55 Lily says to Kumquat the big red felo, "Hey you."

05:57 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:57 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:58 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

05:59 You say to Lily, "Good night my dearest love. Rest well and sweet dreams. I love you."

05:59 Lily says to you, "Nite sweet sexy man! I love you and sweet drems. I hope you rest well too."

06:00 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

06:00 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

06:00 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Lily and Shule?"

06:00 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I got keys for y'all?"

06:00 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Yes?"

06:01 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I got keys for y'all down here in observation."

06:01 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Ok we were just about to go to sleep! I'll come get mine and Shule's if he's too sleepy."

06:01 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep."

06:01 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

06:01 Lily Kaise glides out.

06:02 Lily Kaise glides in from the west.

06:02 Lily Kaise gives you an "Nocturnal Flight" key.

06:02 Lily Kaise slides an "Nocturnal Flight" key onto an enameled purple space cat keyring.

06:02 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

06:03 You blink. "Oh thanks."

06:03 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:03 You slide an "Nocturnal Flight" key onto a keychain.

06:03 You say to Lily, "Thanks. Night babe."

06:03 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well at least we aren't dependent anymore."

06:03 Lily says to you, "Nite."

06:08 The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle impotently.

06:13 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders in from the west.

06:17 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

06:17 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders out.

06:20 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Kani you still got your key?"

06:21 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yea, I didn't knock people in the floor."

06:21 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he laughs.

06:21 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

06:22 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

06:23 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

06:23 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

06:44 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

06:54 You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.

07:05 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

07:05 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Mel, you wanna let 'em in?"

07:05 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure."

07:06 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We should maybe get a doorbell."

07:06 Nicolette Lawrence's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Or let Morris out."

07:06 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No thanks."

07:10 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

07:20 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

07:24 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

07:24 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

07:39 The room grows a bit warmer.

07:54 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

08:04 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

08:14 The room grows a bit warmer.

08:21 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders in from the west.

08:24 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

08:25 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders out.

08:26 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

08:27 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

08:33 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So nebulous."

08:37 Sneaky Little Bastard the old hungry large green felo wanders in from the west.

08:41 Sneaky Little Bastard the old hungry large green felo wanders out.

08:45 Sneaky Little Bastard the old hungry large green felo wanders in from the west.

08:49 Sneaky Little Bastard the old hungry large green felo wanders out.

08:54 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

09:01 Sneaky Little Bastard the old hungry large green felo wanders in from the west.

09:04 Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.

09:05 Sneaky Little Bastard the old hungry large green felo wanders out.

09:14 Five tetras dart around in formation, and then weave around the plastic diver.

09:17 Sneaky Little Bastard the old hungry large green felo wanders in from the west.

09:21 Sneaky Little Bastard the old hungry large green felo wanders out.

09:25 Multicolored fish flakes drop from above and float on the surface. The fish eagerly gobble them up.

09:29 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

09:29 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

09:44 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Nissi."

09:47 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

09:59 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

10:09 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

10:19 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

10:30 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

10:31 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

10:32 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

10:33 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

10:44 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

10:54 An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and advance into the fray.

10:57 The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.

11:08 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

11:18 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

11:28 An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and advance into the fray.

11:32 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

11:32 Listen. You need to be careful.

11:38 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

11:48 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

11:58 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

12:09 So much pain. For what?

12:10 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

12:20 They're just using you.

12:21 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

12:32 You're really alone here. So very alone.

12:33 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

12:35 Remember what I said.

12:35 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

12:46 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

13:02 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

13:06 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders in from the west.

13:10 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo stares curiously up at Lily Kaise.

13:12 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

13:14 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders out.

13:21 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

13:26 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders in from the west.

13:30 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders out.

13:32 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

13:37 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

13:37 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

13:42 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders in from the west.

13:45 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

13:45 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gonna check our course."

13:45 Nicolette Lawrence's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We don't have one."

13:45 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

13:46 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders out.

13:57 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

13:57 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

13:57 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

13:57 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

13:58 With a sound like scraping stone, the ship changes direction.

13:58 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

14:27 A gust of wind blows through the ship, blowing strands of sticky silk like streamers.

14:38 The curtains of silken webbing billow outwards as if blown in a wind that can't be felt.

14:48 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

14:58 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

14:58 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

15:28 Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at the center.

15:38 A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.

15:49 A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

15:59 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

15:59 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

16:02 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

16:05 Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water to swirl tremendously.

16:05 The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.

16:09 Two massive hands reach down and pick up the fishbowl, jostling and sloshing everything inside.

16:09 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

16:09 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

16:10 Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water to swirl tremendously.

16:19 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

16:19 Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

16:32 The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep inside the starship.

16:32 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

16:42 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

16:42 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

16:42 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Living Quarters Four]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source, woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist, smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

22:34 You wave.

22:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

22:38 You smile at Lily Kaise.

22:41 The curtains of silken webbing billow outwards as if blown in a wind that can't be felt.

22:45 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Mel? We're in Feng Wo space."

22:45 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, I'll come chart then."

22:45 Nicolette Lawrence's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Feng Wo space."

22:45 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

22:45 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

22:45 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

22:46 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Right the same time the NDB went to 70."

22:47 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

22:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:54 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

22:59 Damien Alexander stands up from a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

22:59 Damien Alexander tramps south.

23:00 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

23:03 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

23:03 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

23:03 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:03 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

23:04 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

23:04 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

23:04 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Zoooooom!"

23:04 You chuckle.

23:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

23:04 Lily Kaise chuckles.

23:05 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

23:05 A riftstorm appears to be 1.02 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic East and Up.

23:06 Lily Kaise says, "I last recall that the NDB for Andy's is 69 and it may be closer to 68 by Tom town."

23:29 Damien Goss scrambles to his feet.

23:29 Damien Goss steps south.

23:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

23:33 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

23:42 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

23:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

23:43 Ali Candan presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

23:43 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Chartin."

23:52 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.
