Dear Diary,
I've stopped writing for a while because I felt like I lost my inner voice. I don't have the energy to write what has become of me ever sense the last time I wrote in this book. I just know that I'm struggling to move on from Ather, but I'm just struggling with not being angry at myself for wondering why I bothered to give my heart to him, and why I allowed myself to keep having faith in him for so long. He gave me back my bracelet that I gave him. It symbolized my heart. He told me that he does not believe in that one person in the whole entire galaxy for that other person. He told me to move on, and to hink of him as a friend who does not have my heart, but is there for me when I need something, and a friend who has my back. It left me numb, because I knew that I could not find any more reason to keep fighting and hoping for him. It left me shocked and numb because it hurt. I won't even try to explain just how much it did. Anyways, I've turned away from Ather in the concept of having anything to do with him romance wise. I know now for sure that he does not want me in that way. I am just so very, I do not know how to explain. I sigh as I write this and wonder if I should continue to write my ramblings on this page. In the time of moving on from Ather, I had 3 suiters. Caleb, Joel, and this pilot named Jimmy. One I was willing to date, but he romanced me and unfurled my wings of hope, and then vanished unexpectedly. It broke my heart some more. And I didn't think my heart could be broken off anymore than it already was. So I've gone hauling at 284 which is a station that Sean has built in an asteroid field. I've been here for about 2 weeks I think. I've been goin back home in my Capsule every now and again. I am not sure how I am doing right now. I gues I just feel lost. But it's not the same lost feeling as when I got lost in the rift. I feel, sane, not emotionally wrecked, not all confuddled and scared. I feel more wraw and pained, and numb. I cannot explain it. But I know I'm okay over all. I refuse to not be not okay, I refuse to let my troubles drown me. I'm just...bewildered and numb inside. There's also my growing feelings for Pierre. He was the last person I expected to grow feelings for, and I'm not sure I like this. I guess this is what's troubling me most. He was not even one of my suiters, things just happened. Then we got very naughty with each other, and I'm a grown woman and it was, it was very nice. I'm just working on clenching my heart like a fist, and denying my budding feelings for him. Why? It would be like a dying star to be rejected again. My heart doesn't need it. I should toughen up like the other girls and not be so, vonerable. I believe that Pierre will reject me if I told him of my feelings for him, because, what I know of him is that he is like Joel and loves women. So I doubt he would settle with me. I mean, I doubt he would be interested in a serious relationship with me. What I know of him personally, is that he is a wonderful, benevolent, funny mister, and he makes me smile. I'm also very shy around him, though I try to keep a cool face about me in his presence. He has not rejected me so far, but I believe if he knew of my growing feelings for him, he will reject me and distance himself from me. Though eventually I might tell him so, for I like to be honest with my friends. It is strange. I have heard that Pierre was quite the ladys' man, but he never once flirted with me, or tried to woo me until I flirted with him first. I wonder if that means anything. But I also wonder now that I am now one of the women that he has wooed and romanced, if I mean less to him. That is even if I meant more to him when he did not even flirt with me. I don't know what is up with me. I hope I'll sort myself out soon. All I know is the stuff concerning Pierre, my resent towards Ather, my resent towards myself, and my bitterness towards romance and myself. At leastI know I'm okay with everything else. I'm going home Saturday, like back to Mercy Heights for a few days. Maybe then my head will be cleared. But I do miss Mister Pierre. I miss how he held me so, gently and ran his fingers through my hair so softly and tenderly. I miss him smiling at me. I miss smiling at him. Oh for stars sake, now I'm just rambling. There. I have written the
00:51  best I could on what's become of me ever since I last wrote. It may be gappy and cramped-like, but it will stress me out if I have to explain in extreme detail how my heart broke and all that shitty sap. I'll be okay, because I have to be.

00:51 Katina Faye says, "Mind you this is a lot of trust, I rarely show that book to anyone."

00:53 You nod. "Thank you for sharing that with me."

00:53 Give it to a copy of "Ramblings of Katina Faye"?  I don't think so.

00:54 
Dear Diary,
So my suspicion has been confirmed that Pierre would not be interested in me, having a relationship with me wise. I told him not to worry for me, that I am not the weak vonerable girl that once dated Ather. But I'm only denying myself. Of course I won't go crying to the rift about my hurt feelings, but I don't know if I'll ever be tough enough to just gloss over being rejected. It is not his fault. I don't blame him, I only blame myself, because they're my feelings. He was only being honest and I am so grateful for that. What is wrong with me? I am a good pilot, I am great and strong in all else, but when one brings up the subject of Katina's romance love story, it' is cold and haunting. Why do I grow feelings for unloyal men, or men that are enamored with me, then gro bored of me, or something of that sort? The more I experience heartbreak here in the core, the more my innocent and hopeful views on love and romance are lessened and defiled. Hell I do not even believe in love anymore. I believe love is a blue rose. But as I wrote to Pierre, experiencing pilot life has made me grow and toughen in some ways. The more my innocent view of romance gets marred, defiled, and betrayed, the colder my heart gets. I mean, would you see me sleeping with men and having casual sex with them in my earlier days as a pilot? No.

00:54 Katina Faye says, "Read that page."

00:55 You nod.

00:55 You give a copy of "Ramblings of Katina Faye" to Katina Faye.

00:55 Katina Faye asks, "You read it?"

00:55 You say, "I did."

00:55 Katina Faye closes a copy of "Ramblings of Katina Faye".

00:56 Katina Faye says, "So I'm okay, Ipm peachy, just not when it comes to my romance wise."

00:56 Katina Faye says, "Urr side."

00:56 Katina Faye removes a large oval honey brown lacquered box decorated with paintings of light blue landscapes of mountains and bridges from a small lavender silk purse embroidered with scarlet cherry blossoms for a moment.

00:56 Katina Faye puts a copy of "Ramblings of Katina Faye" in a large oval honey brown lacquered box decorated with paintings of light blue landscapes of mountains and bridges.

00:56 You say, "YEah, I can understand that. Like I said, my first two relationships were crappy too."

00:57 Katina Faye says, "I bet you people that don't know me think I have a guy or I'm already taken, or if they know I'm single that it would be good to have a relationship with me. But I just think I'm just dammaged oods."

00:57 Katina Faye says, "Goods."

00:57 You say to Katina, "Same thing could be said for me."

00:58 Katina says to you, "Oh bah."

00:58 Katina laughs softly.

00:58 Katina says to you, "You and Lily is like Me and Ather."

00:58 Katina Faye says, "Together and happy."

00:58 Katina Faye asks, "How could you say the lesser?"

00:58 You say, "But the price to get there was almost unbareable."

00:59 You say, "And relaly, I'm not a good boyfriend for her. I still have no idea why she loves me as much as she does. I'm sure there are many other pilots who would treat her better than I do."

00:59 Katina Faye says, "I'm sure Ather thinks that."

00:59 Katina Faye says, "But he doesn't know how unconditional love is."

00:59 You say, "Many of us don't."

01:00 You say to Katina, "I was almost positive that if Lily ever found out the tdetails of my past relationships she'd never have dated me."

01:00 You say, "Detaisl."

01:00 You say, "Details."

01:01 You exclaim, "I'm not a saint!"

01:01 You laugh.

01:02 Katina Faye says, "He doesn't know that, even if he wasn't around much, that I'd be okay with that now. Sure I wasn't before. He doesn't know that even if he had to suddenly go, I could understand. Because when you love someone you love their flaws as well as their good, you love all of them. He'll never know how much I cherish him in my heart, or how much he hurt me."

01:02 Katina says to you, "She loves you truly."

01:03 Katina Faye says, "I love him truly. I love Ather truly. I just think loving him is, bittersweet."

01:03 You nod to Katina Faye.

01:03 Katina Faye says, "Ather is good person, you must know that."

01:04 You say, "I think we all have good and bad in us."

01:05 Katina Faye says, "You know the first time I heard Ather I was frightened of him."

01:05 Katina Faye says, "It was over comms."

01:05 Katina Faye giggles.

01:05 You say to Katina, "Sorry if you feel a little crowded sitting with me on this chair."

01:05 You chuckle at Katina Faye.

01:05 Katina says to you, "You calling me fat?"

01:05 Katina sticks her tongue out at you.

01:06 You say, "No, I'm probably the fat one."

01:07 Katina Faye says, "No I laugh at it now, I was just on a beacon and I heard him and Aisling over General, you just hear all these normal voice and then you hear a robot voice come in, and I was startled. And I was like who's that? And people on the ship said, "Just a robot. So I believed them until I saw him in person."

01:07 Katina laughs softly.

01:07 Katina bites her lip to tame a blush.

01:07 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Anyone wanna do a poacher camp at midnight?"

01:07 You say to Katina, "Hey, give me some credit here. I'm trying not to be affectionate with you while sitting on the same chair as you."

01:07 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Me."

01:07 You laugh.

01:08 You nod to Katina Faye.

01:08 Katina says to you, "Say that again and I'll shove you off the chair wiht my toosh."

01:08 Katina Faye grins at you.

01:08 You chuckle at Katina Faye.

01:08 Katina Faye gives you Hope the old sleeping small dark indigo felo.

01:08 You stroke the soft fur of Hope the old sleeping small dark indigo felo.

01:08 Hope the old sleeping small dark indigo felo meows in protest, rolls away from you, and curls up to sleep.

01:09 You chuckle.

01:09 Katina Faye says, "Dunno I just miss the times when all of us, all three of our alliances."

01:09 Katina Faye says, "Were beaconing, and doing missions, and nests, and all that sort together."

01:09 You say, "Yeah, me too."

01:10 Katina Faye asks, "That also made me want to take off work for a bit. The...help me say it?"

01:10 Katina Faye says, "The..."

01:10 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:10 Katina Faye says, "When things are apart, and not together..."

01:10 Katina Faye blushes.

01:10 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

01:10 Katina Faye says, "Brings a negative feelings in one's tummy."

01:10 You nod to Katina Faye.

01:11 You say, "But unfortunately, that's how things are right now."

01:11 Katina Faye says, "Just made me miss all of us together again, and now we're all apart and judging each other."

01:11 You sigh. "I know. I miss it too."

01:11 Katina Faye says, "If you dwell too much on it, its a bit of a negative environment."

01:11 Katina Faye says, "I guess I dwelled too much on it."

01:12 You say, "YEah, partly why I haven't been around much at work."

01:12 Katina Faye says, "I miss the olddays, the days when I was a newer pilot and we were all alright."

01:12 You nod to Katina Faye.

01:12 Katina nods softly in understanding.

01:12 You give Hope the old sleeping small dark indigo felo to Katina Faye.

01:13 Katina Faye says, "I just want you guys to just keep looking forward, to hope in the good no matter what."

01:13 You nod.

01:13 Katina Faye says, "Cause if you look down you'll feel the burden of your troubles and you might fall."

01:13 You say, "Lily's doing a better job of that than I am."

01:14 Katina smiles softly at you.

01:14 Katina says to you, "Just count your blessings when things get too much."

01:14 You nod. "I try."

01:14 Katina says to you, "Remember your friends, remember the ones that love you, remember the echoes of good happy memories and use that as a foothold to help keep you going."

01:15 Katina grins ruefully.

01:15 Shule nods and smiles faintly.

01:15 Katina Faye says, "I don't think life was ever meant to be easy."

01:15 You say, "Oh it's never was."

01:16 Katina Faye says, "But it's the good in us, and the good in our lives that can give us a boost."

01:16 Katina Faye glances down at her watch momentarily.

01:16 You nod.

01:16 Katina Faye says, "And I need to go, time is...a tease."

01:16 Katina Faye stands up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:16 You say, "If we still have any good left in us."

01:16 Katina Faye hugs you.

01:16 You hug Katina Faye.

01:16 Katina says to you, "You take care, and we'll talk again okay?"

01:16 You stand up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:16 You wave to Katina Faye.

01:16 Katina Faye waves.

01:16 Katina Faye sashays out.

01:16 Annalyn the little calico CatBot trots happily after Katina Faye with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

01:16 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:18 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:18 The ship is already moving.

01:18 The ship is already moving.

01:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:18 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:18 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:18 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:18 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

Dear Casen,
As Founder of SEAS, I would like to extend an invitation to you to consider joining Space Explorers Amidst the Stars (SEAS), an AEU Organization.
SEAS is a full facility organization with a well-equipped fleet of starships to rent as well as we have two cruisers which are supported and room for two additional cruisers at this time for qualified pilots.
SEAS has access to the Organization area's Genetics Lab and the Range office for monitoring the activity of Temporary Space Stations. We actively support and build Temporary Space Stations to promote income-producing work for AEU and all pilots who utilize those Temporary Space Stations.
SEAS encourages our members to participate in Exploration opportunities and plans to sponsor Expeditions over time.
As a member of SEAS, there is no established requirement of you to contribute earned Points or Credits. unless you are promoted to Trustee or become Cruiser qualified with a Cruiser to support. Otherwise, all contributions are voluntary as our primary goal is to help you to develop to your fullest potential. At some point when you feel that you would like to contribute towards organizational goals, you would be welcomed to but never required to unless there is some unforeseen circumstance which has depleted our resources. So far though, SEAS has sufficient enough resources to well sustain it's activities and to support it's infrastructure.
When you become Cruise
01:19 r qualified and SEAS takes on the responsibility to seek Alliance support of your Cruiser, then we would appreciate credits contributed towards its support as it costs SEAS 80,000,000 Credits per Conquest Period to maintain continued Alliance Support and this is per each Cruiser supported. Although this is an expensive sum per Conquest, We believe that it is necessary that the Corps has enough Cruisers to aid in the defense of humanity. Therefore, SEAS will support member Cruisers for as long as we are reasonably able to.
SEAS is selective in who we will choose to recruit as members. Although we enjoy socializing, we are focused and serious about our work. We want our members to represent strong ethical values as well. We have observed your progress and we believe that you represent these core values.
If you have attained 30 days as a Pilot and are interested in becoming a member of SEAS, We would look forward to the opportunity to consider adding you as a member of SEAS.
Please contact shule Elemmire, Constantine Stone or myself if you have questions or when you are ready to join and we will meet with you and if everyone is in agreement, we will invite you in.
Kind regards
Lily Kaise

01:22 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:22 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:22 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:22 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

03:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Aww sorry I missed her."

03:10 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

03:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

03:29 Lily Kaise says, "So I have learned Casen is a female. I had no idea since i've never met her and I am of the same impartiality. I want both male and female members recruited into SEAS."

03:59 You say to Lily, "You know, before you came along, I wasn't sure if I really deserved a woman like you. My two ex's left me for other man and women and one of them even wanted to marry me at one point."

03:59 Lily Kaise says, "They came to terms awhile ago, that first, I had no desire to become a doctor after four years of courses in pre-med, that I had no desire or interest but I conceded to taking business and finance-relted but I loved the stars moreso."

04:02 Lily Kaise whispers, "Sadly I could only get a certain number in this ship or in an expanded shp."

04:02 You say, "Though she loved me deeply, she knew being a pilot was not ffor her. She told me to go pursue my dream as a pilot, but to never forget hur."

04:03 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:04 Lily Kaise says, "Aww well that's a special woman who would give up a love to allow you to persue your dream."

04:05 Lily Kaise says, "So one time when we were talking about leaving an Alliance and Melinda made the snide remark that Mutuality wouldn't invite me in. That wasn't my expectation."

04:05 You say, "I'd love to help my family too, but they're very independent and don't want help from others."

04:08 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah and if I can possibly do so but likely doubtful, any family I can hurry aboard too. The AEU doesn't understand how billions taken out of their economy will affect them. They need to stop and consider that there could be amass exodus of citizens who manage to get passage to elsewhere and so on."

04:09 You nod to Lily Kaise.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

14:52 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

16:26 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

16:26 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

16:58 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

16:58 The ship is already moving.

16:58 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:58 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

16:58 You hear several odd clanging sounds, then a low scraping sound, followed by another loud clang; the sounds of the torpedo launchers being reloaded.

16:58 The computer announces, "Reloading complete."

16:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:58 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

16:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Defensive Dissidence. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

16:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:59 You are credited with 6,000,000.00 EAOS credits of bounty.
900,000.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

16:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Wow! I didn't know I could pop a corvet in 4 hits with a Patriot."

16:59 Your ship 'Defensive Dissidence' has been automatically moved into a garage.

17:00 The damage control systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

17:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

17:19 [Tactical Communication] Wendy Arroyo transmits, "One for a low tier nest!"

17:19 [Tactical Communication] Wendy Arroyo transmits, "Nevermind."

18:13 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

18:20 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

18:20 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

18:22 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

18:22 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

18:24 I don't understand that.

18:24 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:24 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:24 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

18:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:25 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

18:25 [Enter `yes' or `no']

18:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:25 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

18:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:25 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.

18:28 [Enter `yes' or `no']

18:28 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

18:28 [Tactical Communication] Clarina Taylor transmits, "Alright."

18:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:29 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Alright three more."

18:29 [Tactical Communication] Clarina Taylor transmits, "Actually, i"m sorry. I cant."

18:29 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Neeever mind."

18:29 I don't understand that.

18:29 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

18:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

22:15 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

22:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hey, gues the rest of the AEU went to go play in the simulators. They should just fly beacons for practice instead."

22:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well provided they know how to gun sure."

22:20 Please enter a valid channel to transmit on.

22:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, if they don't, he can just take them on a destroyer beacon. The pilot can evade all day and it won't matter."

22:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well some new pilots and Cadets are more comfortable in a simulated setting but guess it's a personal preference."

22:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn, the new cadet Molly just wrecked me in the sim."

[Starship "Ocean Of Diamonds"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

23:16 I can't find "chair."

23:16 [Starship "Ocean Of Diamonds"; Engineering Room]

23:16 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Ocean Of Diamonds"; Weapons Room One]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see an overstuffed deep emerald green armchair here.

23:37 She appears to be 24 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is athletic with curved hips and firm calves. She has slender shoulders and average-sized breasts. Her face is narrow, lightly-freckled, and handsome, with a straight nose and square chin. Her lips are soft and applied with creamy nude lipstick, and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are grey and wide, and enhanced with thin charcoal gray eyeliner and matte silvery gray eyeshadow. She has subtle black mascara. Her chin-length, fine hair is ash blonde and mostly drawn behind the ears. She has neatly trimmed painted matte dark red fingernails.
A small diamond stud pierces her left earlobe and a small diamond stud pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing an olive green flightsuit and a pair of supple dark brown flight boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a charred metachannel FTL communicator, a plain touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, and a small cloth sack. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

23:37 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ah, okay. Well, if you want we can have you fly one in a destroyer, Casen."
