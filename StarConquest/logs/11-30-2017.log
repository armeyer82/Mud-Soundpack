Hello, this is for those of you who went to NQ with me. I just wanted to remind you all that I'm leaving at 1400 hours Friday, tomorrow. I would appreciate it if you could all please camp out in my carrier tonight, so I will be assured that I will not be leaving you behind. This is for acomedations, since I am aware that people have different sleeping hours. For those of you who have ships docked in my bay, please leave me a note on the coffee table in my control room before you go to bed telling me that you guys are in your ship and on board. That way in the morning, I will read it and would count you present. If I do not see a note from you, and do not see you on board, I will undock your ship, and you will have to fly your ship back yourself. I'd very much like to avoid leaving with your ship docked, and without you in it. For those of you who do not have a ship to take you back, and I do not see you on board by departure time, you will have to take the spacebus back whenever you wake up and have the chance. I'll be glad to give you a lift back through the skim when you arrive, if I am around then. If not I'm sure someone else would be happy to give you a hand as well. But I'm hoping that won't happen and departure from NQ will go smoothely, which is why I'm posting this. Thank you so much for joinin
04:13 g me, I hope you guys have enjoyed your time here.

05:21 You say, "True that is."

05:22 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well yeah it's ok i'm just saying I don't seek to have others having phhotos oe me that way.

I was jsut a bit out of my element there and I never did anything like that again."

05:22 You say, "Oh, I never saw that photo."

05:22 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Heh maybe Ather has a opy of it and probably pierre."

05:22 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec laughs.

05:23 "I don't want to be controlling." You laugh. "I just ask that I be there when things like that happen. I jsut want us to experience it together is all."

05:24 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec laughs.

05:24 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well talk to pierre sometime. I don't mind as long as you understand tht it wasn't ongoing. I just had a little liberal fun that time."

05:25 "Some fun like that once in a while isn't bad." You smile at Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec. "Like I said, I'd just want to be there now. I already have a nude picture of you. I love it!"

05:25 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec squeezes you affectionately.

05:26 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec grins at you.

05:27 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "I understand but some guys might be reallyjealous even though you weren't even a pilot yet."

05:27 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Jealous."

05:28 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Oh I sure hope Katina and Michael are um let's say getting it together? They really are complementary to one another."

05:28 You say, "Some, but not me. I have my very own nude picture of you and so I don't have any reason to be jealous. You don't even want to know how many times I've looked at that. Erm, sorry. Shouldn't have sait that probably."

05:28 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec laughs.

05:28 You say, "Said."

05:28 You laugh.

05:28 Lily says to you, "It's ok Love. If it make syou happy."

05:29 You say to Lily, "I'm secure enough in our relationship that I know you won't cheat on me and as long as we both agree and go through it together, it's not cheating."

05:31 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "That's true although I really couldn't find a reason to be interested in anyone else but you Love."

05:31 You say to Lily, "Oh, when you were gone on that trip by yourself and I was here... It was one of the pictures that I have of you. I looked at all of the pictures I have of you over and over."

05:31 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Aww."

05:32 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "I didn't want to go to bed anywhere. I just crashed wheever I was because you weren't close by to hold onto."

05:32 You say to Lily, "Oh I know. I'm just saying. Like if we went to an NQ party again and you got drunk enough to pose nude like that again, I would get jealous as long as I'm there."

05:32 You say, "Er, not get jealous."

05:33 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Oh yeah but I'm just not in tht frame of mind anymore or at least lately."

05:33 I don't understand that.

05:33 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec kisses you on the lips.

05:33 "I didn't sleep in our bed either." You nod to Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec. "I just crashed in my ship. The bed felt too lonely and empty."

05:33 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Aww."

05:33 You kiss Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec on the lips.

05:35 You say to Lily, "Now, I don't know if I've ever told you every little thing that's happened, but one time, in the control room, I accidentally elbowed Melinda in the chest. She told me to watch the boob and I grinned at her and asked her if she'd tell you. She responded, heck no! Lily has my wine. I don't want to piss her off!"

05:35 You laugh.

05:36 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec chuckles.

05:36 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec exclaims, "That is too funny!"

05:36 You laugh.

05:36 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Heh one of these days when I think she and I are on good terms, I may have to just tease her about that."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

23:19 Built on a grand scale and able to accommodate a great crowd of people, this spacious octagonal plaza is a memorial to life in Old Quebec. The straight sheets of metal used in the station's basic construction are evident in the blocky contours of the walls and ceiling, but painted over them is an engaging mural of an old city with a blue sky overhead dotted with puffy white clouds. In the corners of the plaza are stands of trees from Old Earth protected by elegant fences of black ironwork, and standing tall in the center is a large metal statue with a bench encircling its base. Visible through tall arches to the north and south are wide corridors, while to the east and west are smaller, somewhat less crowded plazas. Popular businesses open here are a bar named 'Au Joyeux Caribou,' a small shop called 'Les Souvenirs,' another named 'La Boutique des T-Shirts,' and yet another displaying boots and shoes in the shop window, where a sign reads: 'Chaussures de Danse.'
You see an automatic teller machine, a large bright blue trash bin, and a small red insulated cooler here.
