00:06 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:06 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

01:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

01:58 On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from scored bark and snapped branches.

02:08 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

02:08 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

02:10 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

14:01 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

14:01 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

14:01 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

14:01 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

14:03 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nap time."

14:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:09 You venture through a side door.

14:10 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

14:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

14:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

14:31 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

14:42 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

15:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

15:05 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

15:05 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

15:14 The stage lights flicker briefly.

15:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:35 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

15:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:45 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

15:49 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morning."

15:50 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

15:51 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thorn."

15:51 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

15:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

15:56 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

15:56 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

15:56 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

15:56 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

16:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:09 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:17 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

16:21 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

16:21 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

16:21 Lily Kaise removes a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

16:21 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots onto her feet.

16:21 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Is it repairs time?"

16:22 Lily Kaise walks out.

16:22 Lily Kaise walks in from the west.

16:22 A personal hoverpallet floats in behind Lily Kaise.

16:22 Lily Kaise pushes a button on a personal hoverpallet.

16:22 A personal hoverpallet beeps and stops following Lily Kaise.

16:22 Lily Kaise walks out.

16:22 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

16:22 I see no "boots" in a leather briefcase.

16:23 You say, "Ah ok."

16:24 Nissi Valdaire notes the current location of the ship on a clear plastic tablet dotted with various points of color and bordered in scientific notation.

16:24 With a mechanical whirr, a pair of tyrian purple smartgoggles with brightly glowing lenses slowly rise from Nissi Valdaire's face onto her forehead.

16:24 Nissi Valdaire traces her finger between two points on a clear plastic tablet dotted with various points of color and bordered in scientific notation.

16:25 Nissi Valdaire flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

16:25 The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

16:25 You sit down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

16:25 Lily Kaise walks in from the south.

16:27 "Hi!" You grin at Lily Kaise.

16:27 Morris Corlew says, "Ah...I uh...wouldn't know nothin bout that. Kinda nodded off for a bit. Just woke up and peeked in there and saw the crowd. Was tryin to see if we were repairin or somethin."

16:27 Clarina Taylor says, "Lily asked and didn't get an answer, so we all trooped in."

16:27 Clarina Taylor chuckles.

16:27 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

16:27 Morris Corlew asks, "She give a distance?"

16:27 Clarina Taylor says, "Course not."

16:28 Morris Corlew says, "Couple hours."

16:28 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

16:29 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Woo."

16:29 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "What's the ETA?"

16:29 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

17:27 Lily Kaise asks, "Oh what is it?"

17:27 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I thought maybe we got in range of Hank's sense of self importance."

17:27 Morris Corlew says, "Well...we get notified for their better sensors...but we can't see it 'cause our sensors ain't seein it."

17:27 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Har, har."

17:27 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I wasn't listening now I remember."

17:27 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "His ego goes out further."

17:28 Morris Corlew says, "Well...good you won't get the Hank jokes..."

17:28 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

17:28 Clarina Taylor says, "He really isn't very nice."

17:28 Morris Corlew says, "He's not."

17:28 Morris Corlew says, "And he's proud of that."

17:28 Lily Kaise says, "Well it wakes me up and I forget to turn it off so I just keep it off most of the time."

17:28 Clarina Taylor says, "Everyone but him is wrong about everything."

17:29 You blink heavily and then doze off.

17:29 Morris Corlew nods.

17:29 Lily Kaise says, "Oh well sad for him heh."

17:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

17:29 Clarina Taylor says, "Not at all."

17:29 Morris Corlew says, "He uh...yeah, he ain't somebody you wanna deal with if you can help it. Oddly enough, he mostly behaved himself when he was in my org."

17:29 Morris says to Lily, "Nah."

17:29 Morris says to Lily, "Nothin at all like Goss."

17:29 Lily Kaise says, "Well Goss is negative."

17:29 Your nerves tingle pleasantly with every pulse of the colors surrounding the ship.

17:29 Morris Corlew says, "Not...like that."

17:30 Lily Kaise says, "Oh ok."

17:30 Morris Corlew says, "Hank is just..."

17:30 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

17:30 Lily Kaise asks, "A sourpuss?"

17:30 Clarina Taylor says, "A dick."

17:30 Lily Kaise laughs.

17:30 Lily Kaise says, "Oh gotcha."

17:30 Morris Corlew says, "Combative, egotistical, arrogant, and a jerkface."

17:30 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

17:30 Clarina Taylor says, "We tried to talk to him about stuff and well, it didn't go over well. So I stopped really caring."

17:30 Morris Corlew nods to Clarina Taylor.

17:30 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "Goss is grumpy, Hank is grumpy and unable to work with others. I can deal with the first, the second is an issue."

17:30 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

17:30 Lily Kaise nods.

17:30 Clarina Taylor nods to Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn.

17:31 Clarina Taylor says, "It bothered me when he was threatening and insulting people he barely knew or didn't know at all."

17:31 Clarina Taylor says, "That's my thing. You can do that all you want, as long as a person can at least fight back."

17:31 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm just hoping we've not taken three steps back while we've been gone."

17:31 Clarina Taylor says, "Oh god."

17:32 Morris Corlew says, "My ma had this t-shirt once. It was a joke...especially 'cause in our house pa was always right. But it had this thing bout there bein two rules. Rule 1, ma's always right. Rule 2, if ma's wrong, see rule number 1. Hank is like that...except he carries a club to enforce it."

17:32 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "Mm."

17:32 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm wondering if I'm actually still voice."

17:32 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "I think Elaine may have tried to run while I was gone."

17:32 Morris Corlew says, "We'll find out soon."

17:33 Morris Corlew laughs.

17:33 Morris Corlew says, "I can't see her winnin under any circumstances other'n she was the only pilot around to win."

17:33 Lily Kaise says, "Yup we will and I wish someone would replace me. I just am there..."

17:33 Morris Corlew says, "To run I mean."

17:33 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "Mmhmm."

17:33 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "If I'm replaced I may get some more experience and work on becoming GSL for the Fringe."

17:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "Speaking of which I still have 2 more shallows."

17:34 Lily Kaise says, "I need to do more raid stuff I don't even have enough Scout missions."

17:36 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Purr will probably fail caretaking, tell it to feed fish instead? We don't have felo food on board."

17:36 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "No she's fine she was cartaking before."

17:37 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Caretaking too well the fish that is."

18:39 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No they didn't."

18:40 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "So if she didn't actually nominate, that'd happen by default."

18:40 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If someone doesn't run, they take the office rather than it going back to the office holder."

18:40 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Oh, well, this is like...really awkward."

18:40 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Why?"

18:40 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We've seen it a number of times over the last two years."

18:40 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

18:40 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Yep."

18:40 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

20:56 From a bulky sterilised holovid: "First I would like to say that the Conservatives have been a rock for the peoples of the League since before the Subjugation, and thanks to Presidents Dietrich and Robinson our alliance was central to the Resistance that valiantly pushed the Outsiders from our space.  We were able to do so much for the League in that time, so I strongly disagree with your assessment.  The Conservatives don't see a need to fix what isn't broken, and the League has continued to grow steadily in these last years under our guidance while others have faltered.  We have a tried and true track record and plan to keep that going."

At first this appears to simply be an extremely large room, but careful observation reveals that it is bisected by some kind of almost invisible barrier at a black line on the floor and ceiling. Sound appears to pass through it, but objects are stopped. Touching the barrier gives no sensation, only the fact that your hand does not go beyond it reveals it exists at all.

[EAOS Quarantine Facility; Bio-Contaminant Visitation Lobby]
At first this appears to simply be an extremely large room, but careful observation reveals that it is bisected by some kind of almost invisible barrier at a black line on the floor and ceiling. Sound appears to pass through it, but objects are stopped. Touching the barrier gives no sensation, only the fact that your hand does not go beyond it reveals it exists at all. Several chairs are arranged on both halves of the room, with a door on the opposite side of the barrier leading northwest to the station proper, while a door this side leads west to the main gathering area.
On the other side, you see Souleater the little striped orange CatBot and Ninja the little black CatBot here.

22:18 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

22:18 Katina Faye sighs.

22:18 Katina Faye says, "Hope died."

22:18 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah.

22:18 Katina Faye says, "My felo."

22:19 Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

22:19 Morris gives Katina a one-armed hug. "Sorry."

22:19 You say to Katina, "Awww."

22:19 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I've come back form a couple of trips and found their collar and things. It's hard."

22:19 Katina nods softly.

22:19 Morris Corlew speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

22:19 Morris Corlew says, "If you're comin over, I'll free up this phone."

22:19 Morris Corlew speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

22:19 Morris Corlew says, "No."

22:19 Morris Corlew says, "One sector above it."

22:19 Morris Corlew speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

22:19 Morris Corlew says, "Ok."

22:19 Morris Corlew places a sterile white einrophone's handset back in its cradle.

22:20 Lily Kaise says, "One of mine may have gotten old while we were away but my other one is pretty young."

22:20 Katina nods softly.

22:20 Morris Corlew says, "The first one is the hardest."

22:20 Katina Faye lies down on a huge comfy couch.

22:20 Evenia Callseah says, "Sir humberton was old before we left. But Johann and I figured we'd let him kick down all the things. And play with his friends. And have the time of his little life while we were gone."

22:20 Katina Faye says, "Hope meant very much to me."

22:20 Morris Corlew nods to Katina Faye.

22:21 Evenia Callseah says, "Now the whole apartment is a disaster most likely, but kicking over things was his favorite thing to do."

22:21 Morris Corlew says, "She was a real sweetie."

22:21 Lily says: 'it sure is and ... eyes tear up my first two died so tragically and I tried to save them.

22:21 Katina smiles wistfully.

22:21 Lily Kaise says, "I tried to escape my ship. We were already in a bubble and ok but the transition to the escape pod, there wasn't enough life support for them."

22:22 Evenia Callseah says, "I still miss Nemesis, every single day. I'd give anything to have another felo like him. He was the best. Gave Morris a bruise that lasted a whole trip."

22:22 Katina Faye says, "Aww."

22:22 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:22 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I'm sure."

22:22 A synthesized voice announces, "A visitor has arrived."

22:22 Katina Faye stands up from a huge comfy couch.

22:22 Katina Faye wanders east.

22:22 Morris Corlew says, "Yep. 30 days of bruise. Folks at Dolia probably looked at me funny."

22:22 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

22:22 Morris Corlew shuffles east.

22:22 Lily Kaise says, "In my situaiton, it was before there were spacesuits for felo."

22:23 Evenia Callseah says, "It's my fault what happened to him, which is probably what hurts more."

22:23 Evenia Callseah sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

22:23 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah that happens too."

22:23 Lily Kaise says, "Poor Happy."

22:24 Evenia Callseah says, "It was a stupid. Stupid mistake I normally would never have made. But I was working on hardly any sleep. Tired. And just..."

22:25 "I loved that soldier pet of Shule's." Evenia Callseah smiles. "He was a little sweetheart."

22:25 Ather Jammoa strides in from the east.

22:25 Ather Jammoa steps up to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel.

22:25 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah he was sweet."

22:25 Ather Jammoa mashes a button on a vending machine of sterile white plasteel and receives a sealed tube of pizza-flavored nutrition paste.

22:25 Ather Jammoa frowns.

22:25 Ather Jammoa says, "What the heck."

22:25 Ather Jammoa unscrews the cap on a tube of pizza-flavored nutrition paste.

22:25 Evenia says to Ather, "The food is torture."

22:25 Ather Jammoa lifts a tube of pizza-flavored nutrition paste and squirts some paste into his mouth.

22:25 Lily Kaise says, "Well which one we had Xavier and an onyx one."

22:25 Ather makes a face.

22:25 Ather Jammoa works the nutritious paste around in his mouth, then thoughtfully swallows it.

22:25 Ather Jammoa squirts some more paste from a tube of pizza-flavored nutrition paste into his mouth.

22:25 Evenia Callseah says, "The onyx one."

22:26 Ather Jammoa rolls up a tube of pizza-flavored nutrition paste from the end, squeezing out every last bit of the nutritious paste inside.

22:26 Ather Jammoa drops a flattened tube.

22:26 As soon as a flattened tube hits the ground, it suddenly shatters into a billion pieces, never to be seen again.

22:26 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah he was a good soldier."

22:26 Evenia says to Ather, "Don't be fooled by the apple pie, or the donut."

23:14 I see no "lily" here.

23:14 Katina Faye wanders in from the south followed by Damien Alexander.

23:14 You peer east...

[EAOS Quarantine Facility; Bio-Contaminant Visitation Lobby]
At first this appears to simply be an extremely large room, but careful observation reveals that it is bisected by some kind of almost invisible barrier at a black line on the floor and ceiling. Sound appears to pass through it, but objects are stopped. Touching the barrier gives no sensation, only the fact that your hand does not go beyond it reveals it exists at all. Several chairs are arranged on both halves of the room, with a door on the opposite side of the barrier leading northwest to the station proper, while a door this side leads west to the main gathering area.
On the other side, you see Souleater the little striped orange CatBot, LuLu the old average-sized red bald felo, and Ninja the little black CatBot here.
Tobias Hawthorne, Kani Kahakai, Cheri Lindbergh, Morris Corlew, Melinda Michaels, Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft, Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys, Wendy Arroyo, Lily Kaise, Nissi Valdaire, and Keegan Wantz are here.
Tanny Hill, Elaine Moreau, Kert On'Marr, Cataleya Sandes, Pilot Katie Celayla, Sarah Bellamy, and Sean Sloan are on the other side.
You can go west.

23:14 Katina Faye stretches up on her toes and cranes her head to peak into the other room.

23:14 Katina Faye gasps.

23:14 Katina Faye says, "Oh hell no."

23:14 Katina Faye's group wanders east.

23:15 Katina Faye wanders in from the east followed by Damien Alexander.

23:15 Katina Faye says, "That's all he has to say."

23:15 Damien Alexander blinks.

23:16 Katina Faye says, "Wait till I get out of my confinement. I will hunt him down."

23:16 Damien Alexander says, "Hm."

23:16 Katina's lips press together in a stubborn line.

23:16 Damien Alexander says, "People do get lost navigating in the rift sometimes. Believe me, I know."

23:16 Katina Faye says, "Oh no, I deserve a full explaination."

23:16 Damien Alexander asks, "Are you guys... together?"

23:16 Katina Faye asks, "Sean and I?"

23:17 Damien Alexander nods.

23:17 Katina Faye asks, "Honey how old am I? How old is he?"

23:17 Katina smiles innocently.

23:17 Damien spreads his hands helplessly.

23:17 Katina shrugs in nonchalance.

23:17 Damien Alexander says, "Ya never know."

23:17 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the east.

23:18 Evenia Callseah stands up from a shapeless beanbag.

23:18 Evenia Callseah strides east.

23:18 Katina Faye says, "Not that I've ever had an brother."

23:18 Katina Faye says, "Just feel like it from what Caleb tells me."

23:18 Damien Alexander smirks at Katina Faye. "From my experience, I'd have ta say yer not missing much."

23:18 Katina Faye says, "Annoying, wonderful, annoying."

23:19 Damien Alexander says, "My brother was never much of anything besides annoying."

23:20 Katina Faye says, "I don't know I keep trying to get a feel of what siblings are like. I had a best friend once before I came here. He was my everything before he ran off. But then you don't fall in love with your brothers. His name was Noah."

23:21 Damien Alexander says, "Sorry ta hear he ran off."

23:22 Katina Faye asks, "And then I joined Morning Star, and Erik and Ali, and Gonz liked to tease but they looked out for me, so I thought is this what is like?"

23:22 Katina Faye shrugs.

23:22 Katina says to Damien, "He was my first love. First loves are rarely ever painless."

23:22 Damien says to Katina, "No, yer right about that."

23:23 Katina's face softens and she gives Damien a rueful grin.

23:23 A synthesized voice announces, "A visitor has arrived."

23:24 Lily Kaise sits down on a small metal chair.

23:24 Damien Alexander says, "Hm. Tube food."

23:24 Lily Kaise says, "Huh yeah."

23:24 Damien Alexander gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:24 Damien Alexander steps up to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel.

23:24 Damien Alexander taps a button on a vending machine of sterile white plasteel and receives a sealed tube of sweetened dough-flavored nutrition paste.

23:24 Katina Faye says, "I refuse to eat."

23:24 Katina Faye says, "Too anxst."

23:25 Damien Alexander unscrews the cap on a tube of sweetened dough-flavored nutrition paste.

23:25 Katina says to Damien, "That looks disgusting."

23:25 Katina says to Damien, "Have at it."

23:25 Damien squints down into a tube of sweetened dough-flavored nutrition paste.

23:25 Damien Alexander sniffs at a tube of sweetened dough-flavored nutrition paste. You can only wonder what's so interesting.

23:25 Lily Kaise says, "Well i'll drink the juice and tea I suppose but i've got to be starving before I'll eat that other stuff."

23:26 Damien Alexander says, "I'm really glad I had dinner aboard ship before I came out."

23:26 Katina Faye says, "I haven't eaten anything today."

23:26 Lily Kaise stands up from a small metal chair.

23:26 Damien Alexander says, "It smells okay. Very sweet."

23:26 Lily Kaise walks south.

23:26 Katina Faye says, "But I ate plenty yesterday so I'm peachy."

23:26 Damien says to Katina, "Yer not doing yerself any favours not eating."

23:26 Katina says to Damien, "Imagine sugarcoated sticky snot."

23:26 Katina says to Damien, "Now take a bite."

23:26 Katina Faye absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:27 Damien makes a face at Katina. "Now what'd ya have ta go an' say a thing like that for?"

23:27 Katina's warm hazel eyes sparkle in quiet playful deviousness.

23:27 Damien Alexander considers a tube of sweetened dough-flavored nutrition paste thoughtfully.

23:27 Katina says to Damien, "Do you have a wild imagination?"

23:27 Damien Alexander smirks at Katina Faye. "I'm pretty good at imagining things, yeah."

23:28 Katina says to Damien, "Than you can easily ignore my comment."

23:28 Katina Faye beams.

23:28 Katina says to Damien, "Eat up."

23:28 Damien Alexander says, "Kinda a sticky thought though."

23:29 A synthesized voice announces, "A visitor has arrived."

23:29 Katina grows distracted and pokes her head to peak in the other room.

23:29 Damien squeezes a small dollop of paste out onto his finger and sticks the finger in his mouth.

23:29 Katina Faye says, "Snot."

23:30 Ather says to Damien, "That's fucking disgusting."

23:30 Katina lets out a soft tinkling laugh.

23:30 Damien Alexander grins at Katina Faye. "No."

23:30 Katina Faye disbands her group.

23:30 Katina says to Damien, "What color is it? I can't see from here."

23:31 Damien says to Katina, "Paste-coloured."

23:31 Katina says to Damien, "Sure it aint' greenish brown? Brown from the sugar being mixed into it."

23:31 Katina flashes an impish smile.

23:31 Damien Alexander smirks. "Nah."

23:33 Katina turns away for a moment, brings her arm to cover her face and fanes a sneeze. "Excuse me." she says turning back.

23:35 Katina Faye nods to Damien Alexander.

23:35 Katina says to Damien, "Keep eating."

23:36 Katina Faye says, "I'm not stopping you."

23:36 Damien Alexander lifts a tube of sweetened dough-flavored nutrition paste and squirts some paste into his mouth.

23:36 Ather Jammoa steps up to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel.

23:36 Damien Alexander shrugs.

23:36 Ather Jammoa taps a button on a vending machine of sterile white plasteel and receives a tube of fruit juice.

23:36 Katina says to Damien, "That squirt looked less, stuffy."

23:36 Ather Jammoa says, "This is the only thing I'll be fucking drinking from this stupid thing."

23:37 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a tube of fruit juice.

23:37 Katina Faye grins at Ather Jammoa.

23:37 Katina says to Ather, "Sweetened pee."

23:37 Damien Alexander chuckles at Ather Jammoa.

23:37 Ather says to Katina, "Better than reconstituted shit."

23:37 Katina Faye laughs.

23:37 Ather points at the tube in Damien's hand.

23:37 Damien Alexander says, "Man, I've eaten stuff other people have thrown away. This is fine. Weird, but fine."

23:37 Ather Jammoa pats Damien Alexander on the back.

23:38 Damien Alexander says, "Better'n starvin'."

23:38 Damien Alexander works the nutritious paste around in his mouth, then thoughtfully swallows it.

23:38 Damien Alexander squirts some more paste from a tube of sweetened dough-flavored nutrition paste into his mouth.

23:38 Katina Faye says, "I dunno, I don't eat much."

23:38 Damien Alexander rolls up a tube of sweetened dough-flavored nutrition paste from the end, squeezing out every last bit of the nutritious paste inside.

23:38 Damien Alexander puts a flattened tube in a large bin with the biohazard symbol on the side.

23:39 Ather Jammoa says, "Hopefully they'll release us before remaining on a liquid diet for too long becomes an issue."

23:39 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a tube of fruit juice.

23:39 Damien Alexander says, "Hm, yeah."

23:39 Ather Jammoa sighs. "I dunno why he had to take off his helmet."

23:39 Katina Faye says, "Yes, I do not like being confined like this."

23:40 Katina Faye says, "Because he was too curious."

23:40 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

23:40 Ather Jammoa shrugs. "I just have a lot of unfinished business."

23:40 Damien Alexander nods to Katina Faye.

23:41 Katina says to Ather, "What did Katie have to say?"

23:41 Ather Jammoa says, "Nothing tangible."

23:41 Katina nods softly.

23:41 Katina Faye says, "What's driving me crazy is that I cannot scribble."

23:41 Katina Faye pouts.

23:41 Ather Jammoa strides west.

23:41 Lily Kaise walks in from the south.

23:41 Ather Jammoa strides in from the west.

23:41 Ather Jammoa gives a letter to Katina Faye.

23:41 Ather Jammoa says, "Scribble."

23:42 Lily Kaise sits down on a small metal chair.

23:42 Katina Faye says, "Meh."

23:42 Katina Faye says, "Not the same."

23:42 Katina Faye gives a letter to Ather Jammoa.

23:42 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Paper is paper wherever paper is!"

23:42 Katina Faye says, "I like the feeling of stacks of papers beneath my hands."

23:42 Katina Faye says, "That feels lonely."

23:43 Ather Jammoa says, "And it's also useful in this place if you want to say anything without worrying about being overheard, since we're most likely being monitored."

23:43 Ather Jammoa crumples up his letter and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

23:43 Ather Jammoa says, "Everywhere."

23:43 Katina Faye says, "Makes me feela shrugs in nonchalance."

23:43 Katina Faye says, "Urr."

23:43 Ather glances up thoughtfully and says, "then again, there could be secreted cams, too."

23:43 Lily Kaise nods.
