-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Merry Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event!
This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However,
we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make
sure everyone gets a gift!
First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within
the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and
celebration a little closer to the holiday!
Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes
for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that
already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action
figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos, custom hair styles, small "plastic
surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest
selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details
for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much,
please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to
add additional lines of text!
Thank you!
   Announced 6 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds ago

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

jeans, and a pair of tan suede clogs. She is also wearing a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect
solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver
wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her
head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both
hands, and waist are left uncovered.

You are at the top of a very steep slope which seems much larger than should be
possible for this structure to contain. The slope soon disappears into a dark
tunnel, and you cannot make out what might lie below. Contestants happily and
eagerly grab one of the available sleds, grow ever more hesitant as they
approach the start of the slope, then, after a long pause, are unceremoniously
shoved forward by an elven attendant and begin their swift descent whilst
gripping their sled in abject terror. In short, it looks fun!
You can go east and down.

You grab a sled and slowly haul it close to the edge, then lie down on it and
pause for a long moment. A nearby attendant elf notices your hesitation, sighs,
and nudges you forward with a shoe tipped with a bell. You shriek in terror as
your uncontrollable descent begins.
You slide straight down the sheer slope at tremendous and terrifying speed!
(15 seconds roundtime.)
Your sled diverts itself from the main track suddenly, and you slow abruptly as
the ground levels off. A small snowman looms ahead and impact seems inevitable,
but your sled continues to slow and stops just before annihilating the happy
snowy fellow.
(8 seconds roundtime.)
The small snowman studies you for a moment, then says, "You are in the realm of
Icy the Snowfish. If you wish for him to grant you favors, you must first
correctly answer a series of questions... of GRADUALLY ASCENDING DIFFICULTY.
Question the first..."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o'
Wonders; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a
small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing red and gold aquatic life and coral rocks, a
robotic chef named Nellie, a sheet of white paper, and Purr the humanoid service
robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a
small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing red and gold aquatic life and coral rocks, a

Dear Mr. Elemmire,
Congratulations! We have decided to accept your application to purchase and
operate an AW-2 AEU Flare-class Twin-Assault Vessel!
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses had your application
reviewed by the finest psychologists, and we also reviewed all records of your
service as a pilot. At the conclusion of this process, it was decided that you
were well qualified to operate this equipment.
Thank you, and we hope you enjoy your new acquisition!
Sincerely,
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses

Ather,
By now, i'm sure you are aware of the League's cessation of
Diplomatic Relations with the AEU. I honestly believe that this is
not just the AEU pilots response but moreso to do with a tendency
which I've observed amongst League pilots. Since I became a pilot, there has
always been this hostile contingent within the League who have disliked the AEU
all along and this was prior to the current state of politics within the AEU
government. This doesn't mean that we should remain complacent and not try
harder to thwart the current administration but the league are adept at acting
upon what they can because they merely can and often without any rational basis.
Case in point when Melinda lied about our meeting on andy's. She did not give me
an opportunity to discuss the issues moreso to gain a better understanding of
the issues. If I had it to do all over again, yes I would have tried then to
negotiate with Johann to bring us back instead of the next morning. I was
hesitant being that it wasn't my own ship which we were flying in and not under
my iminent control. Johann had an upgrade to obtain on tom Town. We drifted off
course on the way to Andy's so it took longer than usual for us to find the
beacon. We really didn't just 'have fun' during this trip as once we got to
Andy's we met with Melinda and immediately left for Tom Town where we recharged
since we had expended most of the ship's charge aboard Johann's Galleon.
Additionally,
I was representing the AEU and not the League and so Melinda
exploited this to her advantage.
You have already likely noted that due to the current circumstances, that for
those of us who own
League Battlesuits, that they are not available to us now.
We've lost our access to perhaps not as much more
We've also been excluded from participation on building Temporary Space Station
for not just SEAS but for all AEU organizations. Still, amongst the three
organizations within AEU, we can certainly establish our own and I can tell you
that LIBS will likely be
willing to participate with us as they were willing to when SEAS
was cut off before. However, i never asked LIBS to contribute.
I believe that we should explain to newer pilots
that we likewise should not contribute to work which generates
income to the League as well.
As current Temporary Space Stations which AEU organizations
contribute to go offline, I will certainly build our own. If
Invaders would like to participate, please let us know. We would
establish a Battle Scanner, A Salvage Processor, look for an
alternative Asteroid Cluster and if it's justifiable, a Xenology
Station.
Regards,
Lily Kaise
