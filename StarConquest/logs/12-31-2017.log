03:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:15 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:16 The ship is already moving.

03:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:17 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Dear Lily and Shule,
I need some help. I am struggling how to handle my reaction to people's judgement and criticism and gossipping. It has stressed me out so much that I am considering retiring. I mean, these people used to be my friends, but now that I've closed up to them because of some tramatic event that happened to me, and because they gave me a blow and gave me reasons not to trust them anymore, they don't take it kindly. Instead I'm being judged and criticised for what I do, sugarcoated when I'm with them, and being very discouraged. It's not making my life as a pilot very enjoyable. It isn't fair, and I shouldn't feel the need to retire because of childish gossipping people who deprive you of what you want to do. To be frank I wish to know how you guy can stand to be around and stick through things, and these people? I mean to be honest from hanging around with my league mates you guys aren't very liked, but I just don't see why. Or maybe I do. Maybe it's because it's the same reason why I'm on their ganging up on side. Because I don't like to be controled by them or suck up to their faces.. I guess I'm just looking for some encouragement or comfort, and a reason to stay. I'm reaching out for help. I'm Katina, shy, hard to stand up for myself, and care too much what people think. I don't want to retire, I love being a pilot, I just wish people would leave me alone. I want to see the kind people around here, I don'
03:18 t often see them. Only the drama stirer upper people. Please help me? I'm asking to meet up with you guys and talk, or perhaps talk through exchanging letters if you don't have the time or want to meet up and talk about it. I've sent you both the same letter because I didn't know who to send the letter to.
sincerely,
Katina

03:18 Dear Shule,
I've returned your calls, sorry I haven't returned to them sooner. A lot has happened as you guys probably have seen what with the league dissolving the pact with AEU. I'd really like to talk. Please can we set up a date and time for me to meet up with you guys.

04:11 --
Dear Lily and Shule,
I need some help. I am struggling how to handle my reaction to people's judgement and criticism and gossipping. It has stressed me out so much that I am considering retiring. I mean, these people used to be my friends, but now that I've closed up to them because of some tramatic event that happened to me, and because they gave me a blow and gave me reasons not to trust them anymore, they don't take it kindly. Instead I'm being judged and criticised for what I do, sugarcoated when I'm with them, and being very discouraged. It's not making my life as a pilot very enjoyable. It isn't fair, and I shouldn't feel the need to retire because of childish gossipping people who deprive you of what you want to do. To be frank I wish to know how you guy can stand to be around and stick through things, and these people? I mean to be honest from hanging around with my league mates you guys aren't very liked, but I just don't see why. Or maybe I do. Maybe it's because it's the same reason why I'm on their ganging up on side. Because I don't like to be controled by them or suck up to their faces.. I guess I'm just looking for some encouragement or comfort, and a reason to stay. I'm reaching out for help. I'm Katina, shy, hard to stand up for myself, and care too much what people think. I don't want to retire, I love being a pilot, I just wish people would leave me alone. I want to see the kind people around here, I don'
04:11 t often see them. Only the drama stirer upper people. Please help me? I'm asking to meet up with you guys and talk, or perhaps talk through exchanging letters if you don't have the time or want to meet up and talk about it. I've sent you both the same letter because I didn't know who to send the letter to.
sincerely,
Katina

04:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident hugs Katina Faye.

04:12 Michael says to Katina, "We might be in the same boat, I didn't take note of all you said, just red it a couple times."

04:12 Katina Faye asks, "Did you guys keep a copy?"

04:12 Say to whom?

04:12 You remove a sheet of lilac scented stationery from a leather briefcase.

04:12 Say to whom?

04:13 Lily says to Katina, "I'm so sorry it's taken us so long to get back with you and I suere wanted to talk with you but we've not been at work much lately and then... all of this other stuff."

04:13 Katina Faye says, "Yeah."

04:13 You say to Katina, "Seems you were frustrated with all of the criticism and gosipping and usch."

04:13 Katina nods softly in understanding.

04:13 You say, "Gossiping."

04:13 Katina Faye says, "75% voted to dissolve the pact."

04:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well and then the severance of relaitons... that's jsut evil."

04:13 You say, "Wow."

04:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We did our very best."

04:14 Michael Kennedy sighs. "And fringe having a meeting about the very same thing as well."

04:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I honestly believe some don't truly understand the gravity of that action."

04:14 You say to Michael, "So are the Fringe going to disolve the pact too?"

04:14 Katina Faye says, "I don't think it was aimed at the pilots specificly, I think we dissolved the pacts to send a message to Best more."

04:14 You say, "Rihgt, and it's the pilots that face the consequences."

04:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'yeah but you all are hurting us."

04:14 You say, "I mean, right."

04:15 Michael says to you, "I can only speak for myself, as for me, I wouldn't say it's the best move, but will see if i'm outvoted."

04:15 You nod to Michael Kennedy.

04:16 Lily says to Katina, "So which battery are the League going to use in place of the Revo?"

04:16 Michael Kennedy says, "Guess the uh, what's it called."

04:16 Michael Kennedy gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:16 You ask, "And did they lose access to the Jackrabbit?"

04:16 Katina Faye says, "Yeah I was outvoted. I voted for the friendly vote. But each vote had it's consequence to try and get a message across that withdrawing from accord was a bad idea."

04:17 You say, "But that's already been done. There's nothing that can be done about that. Our government made that very clear to us."

04:17 Michael Kennedy nods.

04:17 Katina Faye says, "Honestly my vote didn't matter because if the friendly vote won, they would have ramped up to dissolving the pact anyways if there was no change with in your alliance in 60 days."

04:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah well I don't really think they care as much about the JackRabbit though I've seen many League ships with the other Grid."

04:17 Michael Kennedy says, "Sadly we fringe cant even get revo, government has been slow to respond about barnams."

04:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh wow."

04:18 You say, "Really>]."

04:18 Katina Faye says, "I don't know about batteries and what not. I was still able to get the revo from Istanbul..."

04:19 You say to Katina, "Anyways, I'm sorry people are being jerks to you."

04:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident hugs Katina Faye.

04:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Me too."

04:19 Katina Faye hugs Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:19 Katina says to you, "May I read that letter think it will help me remember what I was upset at specificly."

04:19 You give a sheet of lilac scented stationery to Katina Faye.

04:19 You say, "There you go."

04:20 Katina Faye gives you a sheet of lilac scented stationery.

04:20 You smile.

04:20 You put a sheet of lilac scented stationery in a leather briefcase.

04:20 Katina says to Michael, "I'm sure you can remember? I blew a gasket, remember? And I never do that."

04:21 Lily says to Katina, "We'll not be going to NQ tomorrow obviously since we both feel really awkward about asking Nissi to take us."

04:21 Michael says to Katina, "I'd have to see the letter to refresh my memmory."

04:21 --

04:21 Dear Shule,
I've returned your calls, sorry I haven't returned to them sooner. A lot has happened as you guys probably have seen what with the league dissolving the pact with AEU. I'd really like to talk. Please can we set up a date and time for me to meet up with you guys.
Katina

04:21 You remove a sheet of lilac scented stationery from a leather briefcase.

04:21 --
Dear Lily and Shule,
I need some help. I am struggling how to handle my reaction to people's judgement and criticism and gossipping. It has stressed me out so much that I am considering retiring. I mean, these people used to be my friends, but now that I've closed up to them because of some tramatic event that happened to me, and because they gave me a blow and gave me reasons not to trust them anymore, they don't take it kindly. Instead I'm being judged and criticised for what I do, sugarcoated when I'm with them, and being very discouraged. It's not making my life as a pilot very enjoyable. It isn't fair, and I shouldn't feel the need to retire because of childish gossipping people who deprive you of what you want to do. To be frank I wish to know how you guy can stand to be around and stick through things, and these people? I mean to be honest from hanging around with my league mates you guys aren't very liked, but I just don't see why. Or maybe I do. Maybe it's because it's the same reason why I'm on their ganging up on side. Because I don't like to be controled by them or suck up to their faces.. I guess I'm just looking for some encouragement or comfort, and a reason to stay. I'm reaching out for help. I'm Katina, shy, hard to stand up for myself, and care too much what people think. I don't want to retire, I love being a pilot, I just wish people would leave me alone. I want to see the kind people around here, I don'
04:21 t often see them. Only the drama stirer upper people. Please help me? I'm asking to meet up with you guys and talk, or perhaps talk through exchanging letters if you don't have the time or want to meet up and talk about it. I've sent you both the same letter because I didn't know who to send the letter to.
sincerely,
Katina

04:21 Katina Faye says, "Yeah guess we'll all be sitting in front of our holivads watching religious episodes or something however she put it on the board post."

04:21 You say to Michael, "Would you like to read it again?"

04:21 Katina laughs quietly.

04:21 Michael Kennedy says, "Yes, thanks."

04:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

04:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's bittersweet though."

04:22 You give a sheet of lilac scented stationery to Michael Kennedy.

04:22 Katina says to Lily, "Did you like your Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event gift I got you?"

04:22 Michael says to Katina, "I remember."

04:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks.

04:22 You say, "Yeah, and guess we won't be going to NQ either."

04:22 Michael Kennedy gives you a sheet of lilac scented stationery.

04:22 You say, "ER, the NQ party."

04:22 Katina says to Michael, "Ah, what tipped me off?"

04:22 You put a sheet of lilac scented stationery in a leather briefcase.

04:23 Lily says to Katina, "I never got it but yeah I probably would have loved it."

04:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:23 You say, "Awww."

04:23 Katina Faye says, "Oh."

04:23 Katina Faye blushes.

04:23 Katina Faye glances down at her watch momentarily.

04:23 Michael says to Katina, "Remember when we came back from the green ranger's something or the next? And they gangged up on us saying it was better we spent the time at the bubble, and made it out as if we were ediots for doing so."

04:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Jerks."

04:23 You exclaim, "Sheesh!"

04:23 Katina Faye says, "Oh yeah."

04:24 Michael Kennedy says, "The thing is, neither us, or sean artifacted there before, so we went for the experience."

04:24 You nod to Michael Kennedy.

04:24 Katina Faye says, "We went out on adventure with Sean, and we came back and they were talking over comms saying "I don't know why they decided to go to Green Ranger's down fall, instead of the bubble." as if we could not hear them."

04:24 Katina Faye says, "Over general."

04:24 Katina Faye says, "It was Mel Erik and Morris."

04:25 Michael Kennedy says, "So they were all over us, saying that we should have went to the bubble, we would have gotten more from it, and apparently, it was a topic for days."

04:25 You say, "That doesn't surprise me that it was them."

04:25 Michael Kennedy says, "Then said they weren't judging, but the way they were speaking, it was clear that they were."

04:25 Katina Faye says, "So I confronted them about it and said that it felt like they were judging."

04:25 You nod to Michael Kennedy.

04:26 Katina Faye asks, "And they snapped at me and said "No, just because we disagreed, doesn't mean we're judging." but obviously they're judging when they can't ask us themselves ffor an explaination, and talking about us as if we couldn't hear them. Isn't that judging and gossiping or not?"

04:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I don't like morris or Erik because they are hot-heads who think they know everything but are clueless about much. Melinda is a bullshitter. I have gotten on well with her in the past and I try to maintain some decorum but there you have it."

04:27 You nod to Katina Faye.

04:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "She lied about our encounter at Andies too when they wanted me to come back."

04:27 Katina Faye says, "Honestly I wsa close to Mel once, until after the rift incident."

04:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep I understand."

04:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "She is a fairweather friend."

04:27 You nod.

04:27 Michael Kennedy says, "My main problem with all of them is, they smile at you, and act all buddy, buddy in your face, and say the worse things about you, behind your back."

04:27 Katina Faye says, "Then all the sudden when I grew distant from her, rumors started spreading about me, and speculations. It used to not be that way when I was close to her, so I think it was her doing."

04:27 Michael Kennedy nods.

04:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Of course it was."

04:28 Katina Faye says, "I've a nickname for her. Manipulinda."

04:28 You nod to Michael Kennedy.

04:28 Katina Faye giggles.

04:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Katina Faye.

04:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "And what might that be?"
Katina's eyes flash sarcastically.

04:28 Michael Kennedy says, "She's the controling sort, and if she cant control you, she gets upset, so poisons others against you."

04:28 Katina says to Lily, "Manipulinda."

04:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh definitely."

04:28 You chuckle at Katina Faye.

04:28 You say, "I like it."

04:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

04:29 You say, "From now on, that is her official nickname."

04:29 Michael Kennedy grins.

04:29 You grin.

04:29 Katina Faye grins.

04:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I call morris more ass."

04:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:29 You say, "She does."

04:29 You grin.

04:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I call Erik Earache."

04:29 Michael Kennedy grins.

04:29 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior pulsates gently.

04:30 You say, "I just think of creative things I'd like to do to them to torture them."

04:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

04:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah if we go to war..."

04:30 Katina Faye says, "And Morris, just blows everything out of perspective and argues so he upsets me too, and I'e tried to be patient with them and give them chances to trust them, but it's not working. Not when they're talking sugary to me on the phone or in person one moment, then verbally backstabbing me over general and alliance the next."

04:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I will have no mercy upon some and I am not a violent person by nature."

04:30 You nod to Katina Faye.

04:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well you know they are attention whores."

04:30 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

04:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Pardon my language."

04:31 Katina Faye says, "Oh no I've called them worse."

04:31 Michael Kennedy grins at Katina Faye.

04:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Katina Faye.

04:31 You grin at Katina Faye.

04:31 Katina Faye says, "But it's just all childish."

04:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Of course it is."

04:31 Katina Faye says, "This is what the league does they sit on their asses most of the time in the lounge and gossip about other people."

04:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is why I keep General muted about 80 percent of the time."

04:31 Katina Faye says, "And on my alliance channels."

04:32 You nod.

04:32 Michael Kennedy says, "I'm just counting my luckey stars i'm not league, so it's easy for me to avoid them."

04:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh yeah and when I was on the trip to feng Wo they said stuff about others like Evenia and others."

04:32 You grin at Michael Kennedy.

04:32 You say, "Yeah, but we do that and we're separatists."

04:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh and Johann Nissi really bad-mouthed him."

04:32 You frown.

04:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't know what he's done in the past but that's the past."

04:33 You say, "Avoid the League that is."

04:33 Katina Faye says, "And if Melinda has a problem with somebody, she calls them out over alliance where all her face sucker uppers can gang up on me, or whoever, instead of being a grown woman and having a private confrontation. That's the other thing that upsets me."

04:33 "Yeah, she does do that." You nod to Katina Faye. "She did that to Lily too."

04:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Yeah who are being separatists?"

04:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well that is because she can't handle intraction one on one."

04:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Interaction."

04:34 Katina Faye says, "I once asked about a battery I wanted to get, and Melinda told me to leave it alone. And I told her that she can't tell me to leave something alone that I have the right to access."

04:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

04:35 You nod.

04:35 You say, "Sounds like her."

04:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That's a control tactic right there."

04:35 You nod.

04:35 Katina Faye says, "It's the elitism that lessens my enjoyment of being a pilot."

04:35 You say, "That's understandable."

04:36 You say, "Then again, they probably claim that Lily's controling of me."

04:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I know... but I refuse to allow others to beat me down."

04:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh."

04:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.

04:36 Michael Kennedy says, "I've heard that."

04:36 You chuckle at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:36 Michael Kennedy says, "From them."

04:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well Shule is his own man."

04:36 Katina Faye says, "I mean if we had the proper chance to withstand against them, I think it could be more durrable but that's not really possible when they're all kids and attention hores and they all suck up to Melinda or a popular figure."

04:36 You say, "I'm sure. Doesn't surprise me."

04:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I respect himf for that too."

04:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Katina Faye.

04:37 You nod to Katina Faye.

04:37 You say to Katina, "Yeah, they just like attention and to kiss each other's...."

04:37 You say, "Ahem."

04:37 Katina says to you, "Shitholes?"

04:38 You grin at Katina Faye.

04:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh that business on the exploration message board where it seems Melinda had that meltdown."

04:38 You say, "One way to put it."

04:38 Katina says to Lily, "What melt down."

04:38 Michael Kennedy considers a royal blue touch einrophone thoughtfully.

04:38 Michael Kennedy navigates his royal blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When I responded what my reaction was for their not going forward with the trip."

04:38 Michael Kennedy says, "Ah yes."

04:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Melinda obviously didn't hear what she wanted."

04:38 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

04:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I had absolutely no problem with the delay. In fact I was releived as we did have our issues to deal with here."

04:39 Katina Faye says, "I used to be on their bandwagon till I started seeing the cracks in the walls. They'd say stuff about you guys that I found hard to believe. And others. And the more I saw the more I realized, and then they did it to me, so I was like no, I can't do this. And so I closed up to them, and now I'm one of their favorite topics to talk about when they're sitting in the lounge sweating their butts."

04:39 Katina Faye says, "Because I defy them."

04:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

04:39 You nod to Katina Faye.

04:39 Katina Faye says, "And they don't like it."

04:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well i'm convinced that they do this just because they can and even if it has no rational basis."

04:40 You say, "I'm sure they do."

04:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Case in point disolving the NAP."

04:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When it's us pilots they deal with not the aEU Government."

04:40 You say to Katina, "You guys have access to the AEU battle suit?"

04:40 Katina Faye says, "I just wish they were decent."

04:40 Michael Kennedy says, "They don't."

04:40 Katina says to you, "No."

04:41 You say, "I didn't think so."

04:41 Michael Kennedy says, "And it's funny to see them do repairs in a league suit."

04:41 Michael Kennedy chuckles.

04:41 You chuckle at Michael Kennedy.

04:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Oh I'm sure!"

04:41 Katina laughs quietly.

04:41 Katina Faye says, "And I feel a little bad talking shit about my own league mates but it's not shit, it's true, so I shouldn't be sorry."

04:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think we can get around not having a suit to lead in. It won't be easy but i've given it some thought."

04:41 You exclaim, "YEah, repairing with that armor sure works!"

04:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:42 Michael Kennedy says, "I'll try to encourage fringe not to follow league, I like AEU suits, if that's reason enough."

04:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Michael Kennedy.

04:42 You nod to Katina Faye.

04:42 Katina Faye says, "The only true friends I have over there is Ali and Sean. The rest I don't care to be close with anymore."

04:42 You say to Katina, "They're being asses to everyone, including their own league pilots."

04:43 I don't see that here.

04:43 You say, "YEah, Ali has always been nice to me."

04:43 Katina Faye says, "Because it strokes their ego."

04:44 Katina Faye asks, "So as I asked in your letter, how do you deal with all of this? Normally I have a soft heart, but I've been frustrated and bitter and angry lately. How do I not let them get to me?"

04:44 You say, "Honestly? I just surround myself with the people who can be positive. Forget everyone else."

04:44 Michael Kennedy gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

04:44 Katina Faye says, "That's easier said than done."

04:44 You say, "And second, my love for Lily keeps me going."

04:45 Katina Faye says, "The second is luckily more in favor for me too."

04:45 You nod to Katina Faye. "I know."

04:45 Katina gives Michael a tender smile.

04:45 Lily says to Katina, "Well as I told you before, it does bother me and Shule knows my true feelings but I was taught to be tough from my upbringing."

04:45 Michael smiles encouragingly at Katina.

04:45 You say, "And believe me, I've had my angry moments."

04:46 Katina nods softly. "Well, I wish I didn't care what they say. But they know I do care. so they take advantage of that."

04:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

04:46 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He keeps me going too."

04:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Trust me I have almost wanted to go home more than one time."

04:46 You say to Katina, "It is tough."

04:46 You say, "Same here."

04:47 Katina Faye smiles.

04:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You see we come form explorers who broke off from Old Earth and our ancestors had hard times and so they pretty much passed on the philosophy to us."

04:47 You say, "On numerous occasions, in fact, I did go home once for a day or two to think things over."

04:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

04:47 Lily says to you, "But not since we've been together."

04:48 You say to Lily, "Nope, not since then."

04:48 Katina Faye says, "I'll never be charter unless I suck up to Cat's face, and good luck with that."

04:48 You say, "Yeah, I probably never will either."

04:48 You say, "Though I'd love too."

04:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah can you believe when I was between when I left Starseekers and forming SEAS that I actually wanted to be part of Cats? Not now."

04:49 You say to Lily, "Oh dear. You would have lasted... what? two days?"

04:49 Katina Faye says, "It's this whole elitism. You suck up to our face, your stroke our ego, you get access to charting. You do things your own ways, we'll call you stupid and jump on you."

04:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I actually could chart at one time."

04:49 Katina Faye says, "And you'll be lmitted on what you can do as a pilot."

04:49 You nod to Katina Faye.

04:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I had a head injury though and lost that part of my memory."

04:49 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

04:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I could chart in Spinward."

04:50 Katina Faye says, "Oh wow, that is so cool."

04:50 Katina Faye says, "The charting."

04:50 You say, "I think it's funny that in one sentence, people were telling Lily that nobody reports to her and then the next sentence, Melinda is like, I'm going to wield the `hammer of power."

04:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It was but you know... I'm pretty good at navigation and I can generally manage without it."

04:50 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's something I do miss though."

04:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh yeah."

04:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:51 Katina Faye says, "Yeah well, If Ali wasn't in our org I think I'd leave."

04:51 You say, "I wanted to say, and we don't report to you either."

04:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They hate it that I speak for myself and beat my own drum."

04:52 Katina Faye says, "The org."

04:52 You nod to Katina Faye.

04:52 You say to Lily, "Yeah, you and I are too independent."

04:52 Michael Kennedy says, "My org cant get anymore peaceful, last words spoken was probly a week or 2 ago."

04:52 Michael Kennedy grins.

04:52 You chuckle at Michael Kennedy.

04:53 Katina Faye says, "Erik calls Fringe dumb and stupid, and he has expressed many times how he can't stand lilly. But I've told him I don't see what's so wrong with them. They've been nice to me the times I've known them, and Shule stood up for me when Vernos was not being nice that one time when I was a cadet."

04:53 Katina Faye says, "Oh."

04:53 Katina Faye smiles.

04:53 You say to Katina, "When? I do't remember."

04:54 Katina says to you, "Ages ago. Rememer when Vernos wouldn't let me fry a gunship beacon?"

04:54 Katina Faye says, "Fly."

04:54 You say, "Oh."

04:54 You say, "Heh, that was ages ago."

04:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

04:54 Katina Faye says, "Still it was enough to not let thier gossipping seep in."

04:54 Katina Faye says, "Thier."

04:54 Katina Faye groans. "Sorry mumbling, I'm a little sleepy."

04:54 You say to Katina, "I trusted you more flying than Vernos."

04:54 Katina stifles a laugh.

04:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I so want to tell Erik how many consider him to be a flaming idiot."

04:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:55 You laugh at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And it wasn't even instigated by me."

04:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Who ended up in a heap on the landing pad?"

04:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

04:55 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

04:55 Katina Faye says, "Erik just says he likes to eat popcorn and watch the drama unfold, and he likes to stick a hand in every now and then to stir up the drama, but as long as he's not caught up in the drama, he enjoys it."

04:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure."

04:55 Katina Faye says, "He said that over the org channel."

04:56 You say, "Whatever, he's just as much part of it."
Katina Faye says, "It was a complete idiotic thing to say."

04:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But he is also very vitriolic. If he ust wanted to stir up drama, he wouldn't be so."

04:56 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:56 Katina Faye says, "It doesn't matter, it's stupid. Drama's so...unnecissary. Especially with these kids in the core."

04:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Definitely."

04:56 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

04:56 You say, "For sure."

04:56 You say to a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, "You have an opinion on this matter?"

04:56 Katina says to Michael, "Tell them about what morris did the other day."

04:56 Michael Kennedy says, "Oh yes."

04:57 Michael Kennedy says, "So."

04:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He wouldn' put SEAS on the Asteroid processor in 288 and I don't know why Melinda didn't tell him he was required to."

04:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "She didn't stand up to him."

04:57 Katina says to Lily, "Because Erik sucks up to her face so she doesn't care to and lets it slide."

04:57 Michael Kennedy says, "My friend jada and I, were going GMG, we've known each other for a bit, so we're just ok friends, morris knew this, he was on the landing pad and saw it all, but."

04:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Had I held out on any org because I had issues with them, Melinda would have taken SEAS off in a heart-beat."

04:58 Shule turns and listens to Michael.

04:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Michael Kennedy.

04:58 Michael Kennedy says, "So when katina woke up, he asked her, but I thought you went GMG with michael, in a way to suggest that I went GMG, but not with her, he wanted to imply that I went GMG with another woman, and I didn't want katina to know."

04:59 You exclaim, "Seesh!"

04:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wait GMG is work though."

04:59 Michael Kennedy nods.

04:59 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

05:00 Katina Faye giggles. "It was funny. I was like."

05:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I used to go out there with Damien Alexander a lot but there is no way I would have ever dated him."

05:00 You say, "Exactly."

05:01 "It was funny." Katina Faye giggles. "I was like, Oh yeah, he's probably with Jada."

05:01 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

05:01 "It was funny." Katina Faye giggles. "I was like, Oh yeah, he's probably with Jada."

05:01 You grin at Katina Faye.

05:01 Michael Kennedy says, "We just ok friends, nothing like that, I'm happy with who I am with, and she likewise."

05:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I might go out there with him now if I have time but i'm not at work as much anymore so even if Shule and I could go across the skim, I don't know when we would."

05:01 Katina Faye says, "Because I trust Michael and we're too close for anybody to turn us on each other. But my nonchalant answer wasn't what Morris was expecting. He was expecting me to flake out. So his reaction of miftness made me giggle inside."

05:02 You say, "Just because two people go to GMG with each other doesn't mean they're dating."

05:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Katina Faye.

05:02 Katina says to Lily, "You could always call me I could give you guys a lift. Gladly."

05:02 Katina Faye says, "Across the skim."

05:02 Michael says to Lily, "Whenever you two decide you want to go, and want someone to pop you cross the skim just call me, my number on the registry, and I can give you it as well, I'd be happy to."

05:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's just because they always want to create drama out of nothing."

05:02 You say, "I mean, Lily wanted to take Constantine. I wasn't jealous. I know who she comes home to at night."

05:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

05:03 "But I told Michael, we'll be just like Lily and Shule." Katina Faye smiles. "Unbreakable from each other, and not let people get to us."

05:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Absolutely."

05:03 You grin.

05:03 Michael Kennedy says, "Also, I found that you could accidentily rift across too."

05:03 Michael Kennedy grins.

05:03 You say, "Thanks Katina and Michael, I really appreciate that."

05:04 You say, "Yeahm, I used to know the heading, but I don't anymore."

05:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I don't know the heading if someone owuld share that with us..."

05:04 Katina Faye says, "I often encourage Michael and Jada to go do something when I need to salvage and stuff, I trust them very much, and i'm not controling of Michael. We're equals. Though I'm sure rumor has it that I have him under my thumb."

05:04 Katina Faye giggles.

05:04 You grin at Katina Faye.

05:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods and smiles at Katina Faye.

05:05 You say, "Yeahm, just like Lily has me under her thumb."

05:05 You chuckle.

05:05 Katina Faye says, "We found out how to rift across the skim from the other side, but not from gateway."

05:05 Michael Kennedy says, "I'll play around with the rift and give you guys a heading, we were trying to get to roger's bar, and on our way back, ended up on the other side at tandem station."

05:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, OOCly, "I don't like ooc asides but experiencing a lot of network lag here."

05:05 Katina Faye says, OOCly, "Me too, thought it was my net."

05:05 You nod to Michael Kennedy. "But don't share that with us in public."

05:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

05:06 Lily says to Michael, "Yeah we'll keep it confidential."

05:06 Katina Faye says, "And this whole approving creddit transfers."

05:06 You say, "But I know one can rift form Tandem and/or from The Torus, but I don't remember theadings."

05:06 Katina Faye says, "Dumb."

05:06 You say, "Headings."

05:06 You nod to Katina Faye.

05:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I actually don't think Mutuality care if we know but we just don't want it getting back to the AEU Navy or otherwise."

05:07 You say, "Yeah, I hate it."

05:07 Michael Kennedy says, "All I could remember, it's a bit northeast ish, and yes this transfer this is dumb."

05:07 Michael Kennedy says, "Thing."

05:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

05:07 Katina Faye says, "You guys can blame Morris and his mouth for that."

05:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Of course."

05:07 You ask, "What? Why?"

05:07 You say to Katina, "What did Morris say that caused that?"

05:08 Lily says to Michael, "Ok so let's see."

05:08 Katina Faye says, "A while ago there was board posts about giving cadets and people money and spoiling them with it. And also the whole Ather giving Aisling money, and the Mutuality took it as bargaining, when he was just giving Aisling creddits as a friend."

05:08 A long chartreuse soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a shark.

05:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "My number is: 0010-71115."

05:08 Katina Faye nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Please don't share it."

05:08 Michael Kennedy nods.

05:08 Katina says to Lily, "Don't plan on it."

05:08 Katina Faye smiles.

05:08 Michael Kennedy says, "I only share with katina, and since she already has it, no need to worry."

05:09 Katina Faye says, "Yeah, he's looked at my phone and everything, we're really close with trust and all the romance sapppy stuffs..."

05:09 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

05:09 Katina Faye blushes.

05:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We have a problem now though."

05:10 Katina Faye raises an eyebrow at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No access to league so we'll have to figure out a workaround."

05:11 Katina Faye asks, "Whuh?"

05:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What."

05:25 I can't find someone with the name 'evangeline'.

05:25 Michael Kennedy says, "And not surprisingly league didn't try to persuade her to stay, just told her to come to the lounge to say goodbye."

05:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'who evangeline."

05:25 Katina Faye says, "Yeah because they're fuck tards."

05:25 Michael Kennedy nods.

05:25 Katina Faye says, "I mean they're kids."

05:25 Michael says to Lily, "Yeah her."

05:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

05:25 Katina Faye says, "League."

05:25 You say, "If I threatenedto retire, the League would probably throw a party."

05:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Very much so."

05:25 Katina Faye says, "It was so cruel."

05:25 You nod to Katina Faye.

05:26 Lily says to Katina, "What are your colors."

05:26 Katina says to you, "And thanks that would be so helpful. They really do get to me, and I'm working hard to ot let them. But they know I care about what they think, so they use it againt me. Consiquences of being close to them at one point and letting them see your weaknesses."

05:26 Michael Kennedy says, "My view on the matter, it isn't worth it, to punish pilots because of a government they cant control, it's like burning down the child's home, because the parents are criminals."

05:26 You nod to Michael Kennedy.

05:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Precisely."

05:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When we could be the ones helping everyone."

05:26 You nod to Katina Faye. "I know."

05:28 Katina Faye says, "And while we were all watching Vernos on hthe holivad they wer tisk tisking about every little thing about him."

05:28 Michael Kennedy says, "Specially goodwin."

05:28 Katina runs her hand through her hair in peeved irritation.

05:28 Katina Faye says, "Goodwin's a dork."

05:28 Katina Faye rolls her eyes.

05:28 You say to Katina, "That's an undersr statment."

05:28 You say, "Statement."

05:29 Katina says to you, "It is."

05:29 Katina Faye says, "I used to think he was alright. Now I just tollerate him because he's my org mate."

05:30 Michael Kennedy says, "Join an org with just one other person, drama free."

05:30 Michael Kennedy beams.

05:30 Katina Faye says, "That's why I said I'd leave the org if Ali wasn't in it. Don't like hearing Erik in my ear when he gossips. Drives me crazy."

05:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah we're pretty ok in SEAS I probably cause the most drama."

05:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

05:30 Michael Kennedy grins.

05:30 You laugh.

05:30 Katina says to Lily, "Who all's in your Org?"

05:30 You say to Lily, "Oh, I could help create drama if you'd like."

05:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "But Constantine came in today and was totally baffled like what now?"

05:30 You chuckle at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:31 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

05:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes the soft fur of Mischief the old large black felo.

05:31 Mischief the old large black felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

05:31 Michael says to Mischief the old large black felo, "Causing any mischief?"

05:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

05:31 You laugh.

05:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh she has."

05:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around Mischief the old large black felo.

05:32 You say, "Of course she has. She learned form Lily."

05:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

05:32 You say, "From."

05:32 You laugh.

05:32 Lily says to Katina, "I'm so happy ou two are together."

05:32 You say, "I tried to be a good example, but... oh well."

05:32 You grin.

05:32 Katina Faye says, "Thank you guys for being my friends. This whole being on guard and treading on unknown ground because I don't know anymore who would backstab has made me not myself. I miss being soft relaxed Katina."

05:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident hugs Katina Faye.

05:32 Katina says to Lily, "Me too."

05:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh how I know."

05:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I miss being my happy-go-lucky self too."

05:33 Katina says to Lily, "It's so nice to be treated the right way for once."

05:33 Katina Faye blushes.

05:33 Katina Faye gazes steadily at Michael Kennedy.

05:33 Michael Kennedy smiles at Katina Faye.

05:33 Michael Kennedy kisses Katina Faye.

05:33 Katina says to Lily, "He's so good to me, he's so kind, and gentle, and he never neglects me and he endures me when I'm grumpy."

05:34 Katina Faye giggles.

05:34 Katina Faye says, "I tell him he's crazy."

05:34 Katina Faye kisses Michael Kennedy.

05:34 You say to Katina, "I tell Lily she's crazy for dating me too."

05:34 Katina Faye grins.

05:34 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

05:34 Michael Kennedy grins.

05:34 Katina Faye says, "He is."

05:34 Katina Faye says, "I'll never understand."

05:34 Katina Faye giggles.

05:34 Katina Faye grins.

05:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

05:35 Katina Faye says, "So if you guys need anything, I'll gladly mail it to you, or give you a lift through the skim. Just send me a letter or a ring."

05:35 You say, "Yeah, I still to this day have no idea why Lily had an interest in me when she wasn't even wanting to be in a relationship."

05:35 Katina Faye says, "I want to hear it."

05:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well he was that special guy..."

05:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

05:36 Katina Faye asks, "What is your love story?"

05:36 Michael Kennedy grins.

05:36 Katina's eyes sparkle.

05:36 Lily says to Katina, "Thank you that means a lot and if there's anything we can do."

05:36 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

05:36 You say, "I flirted with her, she told me no. I backed off, next thing I know we're dating."

05:36 You laugh.

05:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

05:36 Katina Faye says, "You guys are doing a whole lot by giving me some peace that I'm not alone, that not everybody's brainwashed by Melinda."

05:36 You smile at Katina Faye.

05:37 Katina Faye laughs at you.

05:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm not easily brainwashec by anybody, not even ather."

05:37 You say to Katina, "She'd have to give us drugs to brain wash us."

05:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "For sure."

05:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

05:38 You grin at Michael Kennedy.

05:39 You exclaim, "Of course you two are odd, but in a good way!"

05:39 You grin.

05:39 Katina Faye asks, "They were criticizing use oer going to green ranger's downfall over general right? So I was like okay fine give me the heading to hall of pain, so you won't be wondering why I didn't go to a place that is worth less than the bubble. And guess what?"

05:39 Katina Faye says, "Nobody on general gave me the heading to Hall of Pain. Why? Because nobody wants to jump off the bandwagon to help out the person that they others are chewing on. Peer pressure."

05:40 Shule nods sadly to Katina.

05:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh I could have."

05:40 You say, "Yep, Lily knows the heading."

05:40 You say, "Heck, we could all go out there and artifact for a while."

05:40 Katina Faye says, "It was unbelievable. It was like okay you're judging me on why I I did this or that, so tell me the right way. No dyce. Because all they were interested in was making us look like fools."

05:41 Katina Faye says, "It was quite indecent."

05:41 You nod to Katina Faye.

05:41 Katina says to you, "We totally should."

05:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's a bit west of the 'oh they just love to do that because they can."

05:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just like this disolving relations thing."

05:42 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:42 Shule stifles a yawn.

05:42 Katina says to Lily, "I think you may have had your general muted. It was the voltures that were gnawing on us."

05:42 You say, "I'm sorry, but I should go to sleep soon. You all can stay and chat though."

05:42 You grin.

05:42 Katina says to Lily, "And yes it is so true."

05:43 Katina Faye nods to you.

05:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ye-katina they love to sweep their own dirty business under the rug too."

So I'm gonna try my goodest to be at the party, but I do not yet have a getup. So, I will let the highest bidder put together an outfit for me to wear to NQ. The outfit does have to have clothes involved (where's the fun if there's nothing to take off?) but can be as layered as you wish and may involve paint and the like. Proceeds will go towards the League reconstruction fund, and I'll even match the highest bidder's donation. Reply to this post to make a bid! Bidding starts at 50 million League credits.
