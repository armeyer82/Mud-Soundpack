00:29 [Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

02:40 You peer out...

02:40 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den" and the four-person mule "Daisy May" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

02:40 [Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]

02:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, Emmylou the humanoid service robot, a hefty indigo felo, a medium-sized indigo felo, and a red soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing in a stupor.
You can go south and out.

02:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

02:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

02:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Sort of dozed off here but wow we did something so coool!"

02:41 You laugh.

02:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh too I wanted to check my office."

02:41 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:41 You say, "Yeah, I should too."

02:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok be right back."

02:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

02:41 A red soldier felo marches south.

02:41 A medium-sized indigo felo stumbles south.

02:41 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:41 [Starship "Daisy May"; Airlock]

02:41 You see a felo nest here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:41 You exit the ship.

You can go north, up, and out.

02:41 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

02:41 You can go north, east, south, and west.

02:41 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

02:41 You can go north, east, south, and west.
You rapidly enter a few numbers into a keypad next to the door.
You open the door.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

02:41 You can't go that way.

02:41 You hear the sound of numbers being entered into a keypad, followed by the door to the Ground Squad Leader's office opening.

02:41 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
This office is small but elegant, the recessed lighting shining softly over pale green carpet, silvery white walls, and a modestly sized modern steel desk with an ergonomically designed mesh and leather chair behind it. Arranged in front of the desk are several other chairs, while ferns in white pots occupy the corners of the office, and on the walls are framed images of sleek AEU starships. The door is open.
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

02:41 You remove the 08:00 31/12 AEU space defense report from a brushed steel desk.

02:42 In addition, there appears to be some writing on the 08:00 31/12 AEU space defense report...

02:44 You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, Emmylou the humanoid service robot, and a hefty indigo felo here.
You can go south and out.

02:47 A frisky obese red felo stumbles in from the south.

02:50 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

02:55 A frisky obese red felo stumbles out.

02:57 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:57 You can't read a secondary pilot command access unit.

02:57 You put a secondary pilot command access unit in a leather briefcase.

02:57 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:57 Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings Everyone! I am pleased to report that we've completed our first Starship Boarding Operation -- Congratulations go out to Ather "Goodness" Jammoa, Shule Elemmire and myself for earning a very interesting Battlesuit. Thanks to Damien Alexander from Fringe who kindly assisted with leading with his League Paladin. We certainly want to complete more of these Starship Boarding operations and are here to assist. I know that the new Testudinidae Battlesuit will be a very strong Battlesuit and one that I am proud to own! I see others working hard out there on nests and Low Deployment Missions as well. In the meantime, fight hard on the ground! [01:57  7 January 2318 GST]

02:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh I don't want to toss this report into the heap!"

02:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, keep that one."

02:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or put it into the filing cabinet."

02:58 There appear to be about 19 pilots recently active.

02:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I did."

02:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Fortunately there's not much in the cabinet but this is an historic event so it's worth keeping that paritcular report in my own humble opinion!"

02:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Particular too."

02:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I agree."

02:59 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:00 I don't see "lily" here.

03:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

03:00 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

03:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That suit is really nice the more I think about it."

03:00 You say, "Yeah, I like it."

03:00 You grin.

03:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The only thing is that top weapon takes a long time to fire but it's no worse than some of those plasma abilities."

03:00 You nod.

03:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I went with the top 2. If I really have to, I'll downgrade to the one that fires in 3 seconds."

03:01 You nod.

03:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Which did you order?"

03:01 You say, "I think it'll be fine."

03:01 You say, "The top two I could get."

03:01 You grin.

03:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

03:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The armor will dampen the micro stuff but it's same as with the league. Some may just want to go with no armor and use it similar to a Rats or EAOS."

03:03 You say, "I thought micro abilities aren't dampened by armor."

03:03 You say, "Like on the rental suits."

03:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it's repair so I thought it worked similarly."

03:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Guess we'll find out!"

03:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:03 You say, "Nah, I think it's just minidrones."

03:03 You grin.

03:03 A big red soldier felo marches in from the south.

03:03 A hefty indigo felo rubs up against a big red soldier felo, and both animals purr softly.

03:04 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:04 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:06 You say, "Maybe one of these days, I'll hop over to Tesla and try out the new suit."

03:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah same here."

03:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The damage it can take is really impressive."

03:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "900 just wow."

03:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:18 The ship is already moving.

03:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:19 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:19 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Daisy May! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:19 You say, "NAh it really wasn't that bad."

03:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's nothing at all like the Mother Nest."

03:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:19 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "So not holding my breath!"

03:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Daisy May. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.
You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:20 You laugh.

03:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just glad we were able to get ours when we could."

03:20 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

03:23 New Minor Changes:

Certain factions should be less inclined to hang out in places they're not mad at. Also, if they do, they should no longer drop interdictors for the fun of it, although those interdictors shouldn't have affected anyone they were friendly with anyway.

03:23 Recent Major Changes:

-----
Two new advanced battlesuit classes are now available.

One is available through a mission that has to do with a certain mythical bird of unlikely composition, because the AEU needs a battlesuit to fill its role rather urgently. Though the mission and the battlesuit are available only to AEU players at present, players of other alliances are mechanically able to assist with the mission if they so choose. An equivalent Accord mission will come relatively soon.

The second new battlesuit is available through the Megapod raids and also fills a role that certain ground combatants may be missing, though its need is not as urgent. It's available among the possible loot of the newest raid type. Please look forward to arguing over who gets it first!

Ships with base block attachments must now detach them before landing.

RATS nests will now be found amongst debris fields only. The previous generation pattern was something of a holdover from the older sector system, and we feel this change will make more sense thematically.

Starship first aid kits have been modified to be kinder to the server. The new way to use them is with the USE command!

03:24 Star Conquest Help: Space Market
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Space Markets are structures floating in space, generally above capital worlds and stations, that enable pilots to buy and sell items. The things you find here can be difficult to acquire elsewhere: crafted items, blueprints, items from raids, and so on. You might also just find cheaper hand-me-downs!

You can also access the Space Market remotely with a remote Space Market interface from your local FTL communications store. This is also available as an einrophone addon. Any purchases you make remotely will be sent to you after about ten minutes.

If you wish to sell an item remotely, first place everything you wish to sell into a mail package and send it to Space Market. You may then use your remote interface to complete the listing process.

You do not automatically receive your profits from selling. Make sure to go and collect your proceeds periodically!

Note that physical Space Markets contain sections for books, films, and other visual media. These sections are not accessible remotely, but there are many good things here, so check them out!
