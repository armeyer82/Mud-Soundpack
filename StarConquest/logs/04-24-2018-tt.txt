Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany
bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a
navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it,
a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a
bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a
large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies,
Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement
communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach
chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and
Turbo the arachnoid security robot here.

hammock. Keegan Wantz and Nissi Valdaire are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany
bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a
navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it,
a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a
bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a
large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies,
Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement
communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach
chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and
Turbo the arachnoid security robot here.
Constantine Stone is seated. FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn is lying on a nylon
relaxation hammock. FCI Scout Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and
turquoise paisley floor pillow. FCI Scout Morris Corlew is sitting cross-legged
on an oval navy blue area rug. Ryan Thomas and FCI Scout Clarina Taylor are
sitting on a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered. Keegan Wantz, FCI Scout
Nissi Valdaire, and FCI Scout Melinda Michaels are sitting on a charcoal gray
velvet sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later,
it emerges again and all is back to normal.
The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later,

The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.
A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you
finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.
Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene
to formless mist.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a

The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.
A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles
overhead.
The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.
The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
Listen. You need to be careful.
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
Remember what I said.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as
one, finding a new updraft.
The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
Steam begins to slowly drift upward from the river, then bubbles rise to the top
-- the water is boiling!
The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
[PA] FCI Scout Morris Corlew: "Yep."
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
[PA] FCI Scout Morris Corlew: "Sensors down to 81%."
The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in,
obscuring your vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of
brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked,
"GO!"
Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the
entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey
reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey,
before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] FCI Scout Melinda Michaels: "Don't do the inside with them."
[PA] FCI Scout Morris Corlew: "Ok."
[PA] FCI Scout Keegan Wantz: "Yeah."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.

The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing
that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless
desert plain is all around.
The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to
mist.

Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene
to formless mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the
drain, obscuring your vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The
scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding
you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through
billowing clouds.

The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.

A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly

dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you

it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The
scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.
Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding
you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through
billowing clouds.
[PA] Nissi Valdaire: "Anybody know how far we traveled before dropping out
before?"
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn: "Uh... not sure."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as
one, finding a new updraft.

You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Subject: FCI stuff, reading is manditory
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 16:16 21 April 2318 GST

First thing, welcome to the FWOOF-FOOM FCI. Now lets get the good stuff out of
the way.
We are here as a group to do what we can to make peaceful contact with this
race. This means, evasion methods should be practiced should we come across
something that isnt friendly. We have brought along the combat ships as a
precaution because we simply dont know for sure what is out there. The hope is
that the outsiders have cleared out and we have a nice safe trip in. In other
words, hope for peace but be ready for defense.
Next, behave like sensible adults or you could have a nice ride home in a pod.
While we want everyone to relax and enjoy the trip, it is one of a very
important and serious nature. Typical drama and other methods of causing tension
and anger within the crew will not be tolerated.
If we can land and begin to learn about this race, please do not be stupid. We
dont know their likes, dislikes and what may make or break the start of a good
relationship. This means that we must be smart as we attempt to communicate and
learn more about them.
Know your place. This is Nissis ship, therefore she gets to pull rank over all
of you if necessary. Myself, Pierre and Alexander are the mission managers, not
you. Speaking for myself, I can say that I have done a lot of prep work to
ensure that this mission goes off smoothly. I ask that you do your utmost to
assist us with this mission rather than hinder it. I selected you as a
crewmember because I thought you would be an asset, dont prove me wrong.
Our goal is to make contact with FWOOF-FOOM, gain some trust, and hopefully make
some more friends in the fight against the outsiders. We may be able to share
ideas and even tech that could better both our positions in this fight. So,
lets make a good effort and hopefully come away with a good start to a friendly
relationship and foundation for strengthening us in the fight that really
matters.
This will be our first run using the new rift link technology. If you wake up
and see we are out of the rift, don't touch the controls. We will want to get
confirmation that both ships have a working rift drive before we attempt to take
off. We will have people who are there for navigation and they will know who
they are. Also, you will know if you are on the initial landing team. This team
will make sure everyone is good to leave the ships and make initial contact. We
will also hopefully have negotiations ongoing and you will know if you are on
that team. We will do our best to make sure someone is appointed to be in charge
of the ship as we go along. For example, when I go to bed, I will let people
know who has the reigns and wish for others to do the same. Lastly, be nice to
the EAOS techs!

If you know how far we traveled before stopping during the storm, post it here.
We absolutely need to know this when we're going somewhere we can't chart.

All I know is we'd gone about 14.5 when we dropped out the first time. Then a
total of probably 3 or 4 more LTC for the other repair stops combined. No idea
how far we'd gone when we stopped the first time or this last time. Hope that
helps.

It was 18 before the drive break yesterday. I believe you have that one?
We then went 14.5 LTC's when Cartes broke down. It was another 2.2 LTC's when
they broke down again.
If there were breakdowns or stops after that, I don't know as I went to bed soon
after this second breakdown.

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany
bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a
navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it,
a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a
bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a
large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies,
Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement

FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.
Ryan Thomas asks, "Because I'm sure we've gone a hundred or two today. Just over
30 since repairs. So I'd guess, what, actually 90 tops?"

most of the time."

it."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Me too but who is caring for it. I did see Lillian
on the comms a few days ago but haven't since."

The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey
reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey,
before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.
The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place
isn't right.

likely we'd get a rapid on a third high gunship beacon when we'd already had two
without one. Can't think who it was asked me if that meant the chances went up
as you launched more beacons."
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "But that's not the same thing at all!"
Wendy Arroyo says, "There are three rapids..."
Morris says to Nissi, "Not quite. But if you have say...a three outta four
chance of gettin a rapid on a beacon, and you've had two beacons with no
rapids...then the chance you'll actually get one on the third is higher overall
than if you hadn't done any at all."

what's it gonna be on the next toss?"
FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "The person asked was it higher...I said no, but

Ali Candan says, "You might as well get another one without a rapid. It's all
just chance, and it's just 3 out of 4."
Ali says to Nissi, "You're cheating if you get 10 heads in a row."

Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany
bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a
navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it,
a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a
bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a
large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies,
Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement

                            OUTSIDER PATROL EVASION VIA NISSI VALDAIRE
                            
So a patrol is going along doing whatever the fuck it is Outsiders do when
suddenly a ship signature shows up on their sensors. It's probably a pretty big
signature, too, cause exploration ships are usually big and we're almost always
at full trim. So they throw down their Outsider Go Fish cards or whatever and
run to their control room. This is when they change direction and pick up speed,
which is when you'll see them too.
Now remember, they also just saw you, you're pretty much at the maximum range
they can detect you. So what you need to do immediately is reduce your
signature. Yellow alert does that, so does reducing trim and turning off
nonessential systems. At that moment they've lost you.
But they know the direction you were going and they know where they saw you, so
they are going to check those areas, Which is why you also change direction. You
need to find the quickest possible speed away from where they saw you, in a
direction also that isn't going to run into them as they move. But pick your
direction early and stick to it, You can wiggle it a little sure, but doubling
back or going on a right angle is going to shrink the distance you achieve.
I've seen the Outsiders go straight to where they first sighted you and I've
also seen them go out and try to intercept your original course and then double
back. Hope they try to intercept cause that gives you more time. But either way,
Your goal is to be far enough away from where they first saw you that they can't
pick up your reduced signature once they get there themselves.
At some point the computer will report that they're back on their original
course, You just keep crawling away. And you can slowly increase trim. Don't go
full bore all at once or you'll have to start all over. And that's about it,
you'll sort of have to get a feel for it. Just don't freak out, Stay the course,
literally. Even as they ping and ping and get closer than you can believe. Just
as long as you save yourself enough time to turn weapons and stuff back on.

push it to 17, you could come up with two AEU between you all."
FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I think that's correct."

This chamber contains no viewport. As a weapon's room, utility is the rule: a
large display console shows detailed spacial relationship data and various
status information beside a starmap half the size of that found in the control
room. Smaller sub-displays for lock status and weapon readiness are below the
starmap. The interface for the ship's weaponry is unrefined, but easy to grasp
with even a little piloting knowledge. The setup of the control boards is less
for aesthetics and more for ease of use. Lights overhead indicate that the ship
is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside
the riftflow.

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

FCI Scout Lily Kaise (asleep)
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap, a light blue shipsuit with white trim around
the collar and cuffs, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. She is also
wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset
with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a clear camera with a saucy strap, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria. Her face, both
eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Morris says to Constantine, "Ours give the size of the energy signature and what
direction and distance it was last spotted."
