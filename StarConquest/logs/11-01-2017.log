01:55 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at Fringe Salvage Processing Nuclear Transmitter from the two-person light transport "Evil Eye". The organization has earned 347,881.52 credits.

02:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Holy cow you guys have been busy!"

02:12 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

02:12 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

02:12 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:12 There is one board post.

02:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:57 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:57 You're already sitting.

02:57 The ship is already moving.

02:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:57 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:57 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:57 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

02:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:58 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:58 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

02:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:58 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:58 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

02:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:58 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

02:58 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

02:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:59 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:59 You scramble to your feet.

02:59 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

There are at least a couple of individuals who may not show. Then I hear Hakeem retired so his slot is open but that will probably go to Kim if she has asked. Still I suggest we put everything we need into my ship but take yours over as well and see how things go. Then whatever you need of your items, you can always move to your ship."

13:43 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Do you mean you've done a character concept and want to do a profile now? If so, all the helpfiles in the profile category are really helpful."

13:44 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Well, read them, and no, not sure i've done the concept. I miss the how. I mean, I know what to do, almost, but I miss how to do it."

13:45 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well the profile you do by typing profile."

13:45 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "They didn't do concepts when I was doing this so I don't know how to do that. Maybe type concept?"

13:45 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The profile and the concept are two separate things that you submit separately, the concept before the profile."

13:47 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh you just meant the command. Sorry, I don't know either."

13:47 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "No, concept doesn't work. That's exactly why I ask. I know what to do, but the helpfile says nothing about how, or I can't read. Profile command work."

13:47 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "*laughs*."

13:48 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yeah, maybe if you type profile it'll tell you what you'd have to do to submit your concept?"

13:53 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "No, but since I have already used the profile command, it now says the concept is queued *sighs*."

13:54 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.

13:54 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "So, the profile is the concept that is the profile. I'm not sure if that is logic, but that's how it is *smiles*. Thanks all."

18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It really doesn't matter whether you take the northeast or south exit of the spaceport. Both are on level 2 of it."

18:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. I didn't realize there were two exits, so I'm not even sure why I specified a direction."

18:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.

18:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Our current president has arranged for us to leave the Accord of Free Worlds."

18:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A lot of people are worried that doing so will weaken the Union."

19:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Anyone arranged for his resignation and application form to the nuthouse yet?"

19:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.

19:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I assume accord of free worlds has stuff we use, so leaving would be a bad thing."

19:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Bah!"

19:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Do we as average citizens get a say in this?"

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That may be true, but it's not really about the stuff."

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It has stuff that we as pilots use, yeah, so it will be bad for us. The citizens of the AEU likely see the Accord as a pointless credit sink."

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Heh no? Does a bear shit in a crystal toilet?"

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is why Best had the massive support he needed to do this, I imagine."

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. we had a say in it when folks voted for the president that said he wanted to do it."

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "If you give him a crystal toilet, he might."

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin laughs.

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Hmm! Have to try with aytheor next time he's around."

19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Leaving the Accord might actually improve our economy in the short term, or even in the long term. But I think the main issue is that humanity's best chance against invasion by the Outsiders is presenting a united front."

19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "And, I can officially say, I didn't vote for best. I didn't vote at all, was too young."

19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We actually fought for months to stop it actually. With lots of escalations."

19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Why are you always picking on aytheor."

19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley laughs.

19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Because he picks on me? Swings and. Uh, what's the saying swings and... something or other."

19:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade giggles and transmits, I guess that makes it fair. and yeah constantine, I have to agree that if we're going to fight outsiders, it should be a united front, so I can see why this might be an issue

19:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm hoping that if they do come for us, Best will know that our only chance is to throw everything we have in with everyone else's efforts."

19:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And that if they come for the Union specifically, the Accord and other alliances will still help out."

19:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "You think?"

19:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "The AEU will be a high priority target, that goes without saying. And considering the accord seems to have a bigger navy than we do, I'm not liking our chances. Considering further, the outsiders took on all three alliances before the revolution and won? I don't like our chances."

19:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Yeah... it doesn't sound good at all."

22:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That minimod would protect against some of the damage."

22:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I've seen bari do similar things as well."

22:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah. I guess that will be useful when nesting then."
