Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;
Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a
glass top here.
You can go out.

to do some before my... absence. but alas, never got round to it. I must unpack
now, and get this ship back in order, *the sound of crash and then a smash*, as
you can no doubt here, it's rather a mess. Alas, engineers are not the kindest

doing all he can to remove the AEu from the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Uh, why?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Who can know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, the AEU pours
about 500 million credits a week, plus personelle into the Accord, but those are
all necessary things if we want to defend against the IFS and the Outsiders.
However, President Best seems to -wrongly- think that the Outsiders and the IFS
are no longer a threat. He'll change his tune soon enough when they inevitably
launch invasions that will lose billions of credits in ships and who all can
know what else. It's a matter of time before he and his administration tries to
salvage what will ultimately be a pretty royal fuckup."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Quite! What's he
smoking, and can I have some?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't think you'd
want some if it's making him act -that- stupid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "At least he's not so
anal as to have tried to directly take out that station.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "My father thinks the
outsiders aren't in chaos, you know. He thinks its a front."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, they're very
real. I fought them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Mhm, but you know
how some people think killing that overlord through them into chaos? He doesn't
agree."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "He's not dead."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "He's imprisoned."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Is he being milked
for information?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We don't really know
what the EAOS is doing with him. Maybe they're using his lifeforce to power the
Torus for all I know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Oh for the love of.
Either milk him, and keep him alive, or kill him. Honestly!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Where ever he is, I
hope it hurts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "I think
those three options apply to most living things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "3?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "Milk, let
live, kill."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Hey, don't forget
screw, too. That's important..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "Doesn't
that count as milking?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Depends how its
done, I suppose.."

done right, I suppose it would."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pair of blue low rise denim jeans and a pair of white leather
clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an
orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone
in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold
ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a
pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', and a star print mandolin case. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a
letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, a letter, a soft blush pink cotton bra
decorated with a tiny ribbon rosette in the center, and a short-sleeved aqua
sailor top with a soft white bow here.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
^J2OFzMDkti;1!KqB$SnV_<]@0lUqlS*]lP]uw77
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a short-sleeved aqua sailor top with a soft white bow, a pair of
blue low rise denim jeans, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of
glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white
blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a
perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the
side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a star print
mandolin case. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
