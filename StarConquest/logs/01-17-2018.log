-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

03:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go out.

03:27 I don't see "lily" here.

03:27 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:27 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:27  You are wearing a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

03:27 You are carrying nothing.

03:27 You exit the ship.

03:27 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

03:27 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

03:27 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:27 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:27 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated red sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:27 You can't take an insulated red sleeping bag.

03:27 You quickly roll an insulated red sleeping bag up and and tie it securely with the conveniently attached straps.

03:27 I see no "breifcase" here.

03:27 You pick up an insulated red sleeping bag.

03:27 You put an insulated red sleeping bag in a leather briefcase.

03:27 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Beta.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:28 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Weapons Room]

03:28 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go west.

03:28 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:28 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Storage Room]

03:28 You see a simple cardboard box labeled 'Kaise, Lily' here.
You can go northwest.

03:28 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:28 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:28 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:28 There appear to be about 29 pilots recently active.

03:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:28 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 644" has jumped into the sector.

03:28 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 644! Welcome to home space!"

03:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello SEAS."

03:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:28 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:28 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:28 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:28 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

03:28 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

03:28 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:29 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 967" has jumped into the sector.

03:29 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 967! Welcome to home space!"

03:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:29 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:29 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

All active AEU organizations are a part of this scanner, but the scanner itself is not the best that it can be, and probably won't be unless and until we can get Kim available to see which ones starseekers qualify for. In the meantime, if you want to do decoy beacon drops, west of steel phoenix command is the way to go. [01:31 17 January 2318 GST]

03:37 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

03:37 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:38 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:38 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

03:39 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:39 I can't find "sofa."

03:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:39 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

03:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:40 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Vortex Industries 281" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:40 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

17:39 [Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.
You can go north and south.

18:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The landing pad, like all exterior portions of the facility, is covered with a giant Faraday cage which keeps out the electrical blasts that are hurled down from the sky on a regular basis. To stand in when the cage is opened, such as when a starship is departing or arriving, a number of tall lightning rods surround the pad, each attached to a drooping grounding wire that buries itself in the ground.

19:52 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

19:52 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The landing pad, like all exterior portions of the facility, is covered with a giant Faraday cage which keeps out the electrical blasts that are hurled down from the sky on a regular basis. To stand in when the cage is opened, such as when a starship is departing or arriving, a number of tall lightning rods surround the pad, each attached to a drooping grounding wire that buries itself in the ground.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

22:20 I don't understand that.

22:20 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:20 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

22:51 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

22:51 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
