-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Merry Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event!

This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However, we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make sure everyone gets a gift!

First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and celebration a little closer to the holiday!

Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos
00:11 , custom hair styles, small "plastic surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much, please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to add additional lines of text!

Thank you!
   Announced 2 days, 20 hours, and 43 minutes ago

00:11 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated red sleeping bag here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on an insulated red sleeping bag.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
