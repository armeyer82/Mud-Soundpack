Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a pair of
tan suede clogs here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

a sleeping atrophied orange soldier felo
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely wolf-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is small in size and covered in short, striped orange fur,
possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, curved white claws,
visible only when not retracted. A black, arrow nose sits below a pair of clear
indigo eyes with vertical pupils. It appears to be sleeping.
A sleeping atrophied orange soldier felo suddenly sneezes, bolting upright. It

and told her how things were with me and why I closed up to her and stuff."
'Ah ok
You say, "Ah ok."

You ask, "And what did she say?"
Katina Faye says, "Well I told her all the things that pissed me off about her.
And why I closed up. But right um, when I mentioned her not telling me where the
heading to the hall of pain was, she claimed that she probably turned off her
comm durring that arguement over general."

pain."

Morris."

something going on with Jada."

'I remember thaqt.
You say, "I remember thaqt."

You say, "That."
Katina Faye says, "But me being good hearted and trusting, was like "Pfff,
whatever, he'd never do that.""
'Let me guess, he was with Jada?
You ask, "Let me guess, he was with Jada?"
Katina Faye says, "And he convinced me that they were good friends for the
longest time, so...I dunno. Guess I bit the bate."
'Awwww
You say, "Awwww."
Katina Faye says, "But now that we're not together, I thought he'd move on. In
fact I was very sure of it, that it wouldn't take him long at all."
'right
You say, "Right."
Katina Faye says, "And it hasn't, it's just the person he supposedly has a thing
going on with is what caught me off guard."
'Is it Jada?
You ask, "Is it Jada?"
Katina Faye says, "Which is Jada. And he says that she is keeping it on the down
low, until she talks to Caleb about it. So right now, if they're doing anything
more than friendly she's basically cheating."
Katina Faye says, "So I guess I was right to break up with Michael because one
of the reasons being that I felt like I couldn't trust him to be loyal. But it
just makes me wonder, what did they do when they were doing things together,
especially when he was upset with me, or I upset at him. I wouldn't and didn't
suspect athing."
'wow!
You exclaim, "Wow!"
Katina Faye says, "When we were together that is."
'I'm so sorry!

whatever happened to me with the rift, did have affect on him."
Katina Faye says, "But."
'Ah ok.
You say, "Ah ok."
Katina Faye says, "We couldn't be together because his view is that the
government decides if we should have arelationship or not."
nod 'I see.
You nod. "I see."
Katina Faye says, "And since there is discourse between the league and AEU, well
we can't be together."
'right
You say, "Right."
Katina says to you, "Everybody has their opinion, but do you think that's right
or wrong?"
'I personally don't agree with him. I think if you two want to be together and
are willing to deal with the consequences, so be it.
You say, "I personally don't agree with him. I think if you two want to be

'I understand where he's coming from.
You say, "I understand where he's coming from."
Katina Faye says, "Which is Joel and Mel. I'd tell ali about it, but he'd just
roll his eyes inwardly and tell me to fuck Ather and that I'm stupid to waste my

You chuckle.
Katina Faye says, "But yes, Ather's views on relationships makes me feel
worthless to him, but I..."

on trying to let go."

Katina Faye says, "He says because of the way our government is and the pirate
thing, he will encourage his alliance mates to not have a pact with the league
if he can help it. So before he was wanting to work something out as far as
government goes, but now he doesn't want to work anthing out with us."
'Anyways, I really shouldn't because of the fact that there is tention between
the two alliances.

opening her mouth to try and say her words.
'Please what?
You ask, "Please what?"
: waits patiently.
Shule waits patiently.
Katina says to you, "That is Ather's view on what iniciates his relationships,
but even though I respect his decisions, I would...It's just cruel, so please
don't have the same mind set as he does. In some relm of possibility, if you
were in the situation that I am with Ather, you'd make the girl feel very
heartbroken and inferior. I do not think it is the right mind set to be in. But
forgive me if that offends. When you have feelings for someone, you're supposed
to appreciate them for their heart, not their government status."
Katina Faye says, "It might as well be saying."
'Oh I very much agree with you.
You say, "Oh I very much agree with you."
Katina Faye says, "I like you because you are sickly rich, so screw you if you
ever get poor."
Katina averts her gaze.

You say, "Oh, I thought you were asking has anyone ever made me blush."
'IO miss heard your question.
You say, "IO miss heard your question."
Katina Faye says, "Well I gave one reason, I'm bored. The other reason now is
because I'm curious now."

You smile at Katina Faye.
'I'm glad.
You say, "I'm glad."
Katina Faye says, "I've had strong feelings for Ather still, for 4 months after
he let me go, and I'm just cursing myself at how hard it is to get over him."
Katina Faye says, "I don't understand why I feel this way."
'It can happen when we care about someone very deeply.
You say, "It can happen when we care about someone very deeply."
Katina Faye says, "Well, I wish I was amuned to romance. It would be better to
deal with heartbreak, because there wouldn't be any."
Katina Faye giggles.
Katina Faye says, "I could care for someone as friends, and brothers and
sisters, and it might be grand, the thought of it anyways in my head."
'Maybe, but then you'd never know the joy of being with someone that you truly
love and truly loves you. Lily didn't want to date at all when she became a
pilot. Now, she would give anything to remain with me.
You say, "Maybe, but then you'd never know the joy of being with someone that
you truly love and truly loves you. Lily didn't want to date at all when she
became a pilot. Now, she would give anything to remain with me."
Katina says to you, "I'm just afraid to go on a relationship with someone
because I don't want to get my heart broken like I have with Ather. Yet I want
to feel valued and treasured so it's a bit hard to say no when somebody wants to
take me out on a date."
nod katina I understand.
I don't see that here.
nod katina 'I understand.
You nod to Katina Faye. "I understand."
-katina Remember, Lily told me in no uncertain terms that she wasn't looking for
a relationship when I first flirted with her.
You say to Katina, "Remember, Lily told me in no uncertain terms that she wasn't

'It will be

You say to Katina, "You're a good person and good things will come to you."
Katina Faye says, "The past is our ghost because it haunts us. The future is our
hope, because it is something to look forward to. And the present is a gift,
because it is a reminder of our existence, and that we've made it through to the

I don't understand that.
Katina says to you, "Oh blah. Don't be so pessimistic about yourself."
Katina Faye asks, "What have you done that makes you feel that way?"
Katina Faye asks, "Have you murdered anyone? Abused anyone?"
-katina Just being realistic is all. I've broken my fair share of hearts in the
past.
You say to Katina, "Just being realistic is all. I've broken my fair share of
hearts in the past."
Katina Faye asks, "Deliberately?"
Katina Faye asks, "Did you get sadistic pleasure out of it?"
-katina Whether or not it was deliberate or not, it still hurt people.
You say to Katina, "Whether or not it was deliberate or not, it still hurt
people."
Katina Faye shrugs. "Shame is alright, but shame is our caution and a sign that
we've learned from a mistake we've made or lesson or another."
Katina Faye says, "It shouldn't be a taunt to ourselves to bring us down."
Katina says to you, "Okay, you've made mistakes, I've made mistakes. But chin up
a little, the person that you make mistakes with isn't perfect either. We're
humans and we can't run from our flaws. I think when we learn from our mistakes
and try to do better about it, then that is what gives it a bit of justice. Or
do you not think I make any sense, and am most likely rambling?"
Katina laughs quietly.
Katina Faye says, "You seem sorry about your mistakes. I think that is enough to
keep you from going to the evil place that people might end up wherever. That
place is for those that have no regret for their wicked deeds."
'Hopefully
You say, "Hopefully."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser

Lily Kaise glides in from the south.
Lily Kaise glides out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, the navy
sends a lot of ships to help, but the cruiser method is probably the best
method. It will leave the cruiser vulnerable while we destroy the battleship
though."
Lily Kaise just entered the ship.
Lily Kaise kisses you.
Lily Kaise glides out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily, we're waiting
for you in the lounge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm still short
lock evasions for a cruiser."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Note: this will
probably take at least an hour to an hour and a half. I hope you all have the
time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I should be
good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The cruise ris taken
care of."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The guy won't
talk to me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Why not?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The guy on Steel
command?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure. He
says he doesn't think I can be of any help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Interesting. I wonder
what the requirements are."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "What's your Ground
Combat Constantine?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "1538."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I need
1800."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Does the suit
only come as a tier 5?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Doubtful. That makes
no sense since there are lower tiers of those suits available."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm that should be
sufficient for more than the lowest tier at the minim and yeah what Ather said."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You don't think
it's the ship I went there in?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Doubtful. I think I
went there in uh, my destroyer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But feel free to
try."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah I don't even
remember but yeah maybe I did go over in a gem but it shouldn't ever matter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nope."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, I think I
kind of remember talking to him some time ago."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder what
changed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Did you maybe assign
the mission then?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't believe
so, as I have none pending."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess I
can't be sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's not an officila
mission like all that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there any way
I would check?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily, come to the
lounge. Let's head out there and see what happens."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You too,
constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I genuinely hope you
did not assign the mission back then, or we're going to have some pissed off
naval officers later on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think I
did."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That doesn't
sound like something I would do."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its

Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has

A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings politely as it receives a

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry about that
guys, I was using only minors before they replicated but they still hit me a
couple times."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then I couldn't
keep up once there were 4 of them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No wor-r-r-rr-r-r-rie

-n-n. We wen-n-n-nt wr-r-r-rong somewhere, and I need t-t-t-to figure out-t-t-t

A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough yellow tendrils slowly waves its

Sorry folks."
[Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Oh uh, forgot to say,
yeah."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles
around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a
plastic flower with red petals.
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with narrow dangling tendrils and an

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alright, I think next
time things will go much more smoothly! Take heart, take heart!"

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling
bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red
aquatic life and coral rocks, a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling
ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice
Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, a small dusky pink trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid
security robot, a small Bari-shaped tidbit, and Purr the humanoid service robot
here.

a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. Its stomach is bulging, but it
seems content to slowly digest its large meal.
