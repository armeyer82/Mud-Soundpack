Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a pair of violet red leather boots decorated with neon red stars, and a pair of tan suede clogs here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.

04:59:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a short-sleeved baby blue and white striped v-neck tee and a pair of tight light blue denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side,
04:59:01  and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" in her right hand.

08:18:00 You scramble to your feet.

08:18:01 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo slides to the floor.
[Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

08:18:11 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

08:18:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

08:18:12 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

08:18:16 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

08:18:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

08:18:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

08:18:27 The ship is already moving.

08:18:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

08:18:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

08:18:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:18:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

08:18:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:18:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

08:18:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

08:18:35 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:20:32 You can't go that way.

08:20:36 [Chetumal Spaceport; Garage]

08:20:36 Starships of various sizes and shapes are parked here. The area is large, able to accommodate hundreds of starships, and the ceiling is high, interlaced with the high-pressure pipes and mechanisms of the massive hydraulic system that moves ships between the garage and the landing pad above. Though the hydraulics are noisy and echo loudly through the area when activated, you can still hear the footsteps of pilots and travelers as they make their way along the wide metal stairway leading up to the landing pad and down to lower levels of the subterranean spaceport. A well-lit stairway here provides easy access to the pilot lounge.

08:20:49 Board what?

08:20:53 Board what?

08:20:53 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

08:20:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Well, it's been rain free here for a couple of days now, and waters are finally starting to recede. thank you all for your thoughts and prayer. We somehow got away with no problems in the end, despite their being people just a mile away who's houses are underwater
i realize at this late hour that this post should have probably gone in general general, sorry about that

08:23:21 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

08:52:41 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

08:52:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

Hello Kim,
Shule and I are following in the convoy to Andy's which leaves tomorrow at 0200. At this time, we don't plan to return with Johann and Sean as we want to go to an artifacting field near Tom Town called Sea of Fears. SEAS has nearly 1500 Exploration so we'll each artifact to add to that balance.
While we're away, as of this date and according to the Range Office, the Asteroid Processing station in Alpha 285 will go offline in just under 5 days and the Salvaging Station will go offline in about 9 days. I know we won't be back before the Asteroid Processing station goes offline and may not have returned to deploy the replacement Salvaging station.
We'd really appreciate your assistance with deploying the replacement stations. I have built both stations aboard Herding Cats, my constructor so all that needs to be done is to fly the constructor out to Alpha 285 and to deploy each station when needed. I have enclosed a key to Herding Cats for you to use for this purpose.
Thanks for your assistance and we'll be more than happy to return a similar favor when needed.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

09:09:45 Lily:
For the last few weeks you have been saying repeatedly that there is nothing more important than stopping Outccord negotiations and getting the AEU back on track. However, on September 5, when we asked you to join the protest that we were holding as an attempt to encourage the government to stop Outccord negotiations, you chose to replace a temporary beacon rather than assist your fellow pilots. Your choices not only infuriated me, but infuriated all of the other pilots who were present. All of the other pilots who witnessed your true feelings about the alliance that you claimed to love.

The issue is not so much that you just flat out refused to attend the protest. it's that for the longest time, as I said earlier, you have been preaching about how important it is for the AEU to remain in the Accord, and to get back to the way it was. Yet when we ask you to help with it, you choose to sit back, go restore the temporary beacon to some stupid artifacting and salvage site, rather than actually help us with our efforts. You need to figure out where your priorities lie. Until then, I requested from all organizations that they revoke your access to all of their warehouses, and stop using your organization's station parts for the foreseeable future. Odds are, when you get this letter, we will still be protesting. You can jump on comms, jump on the boards, and transmit or write one of your usual rants. I am curious to see 
09:09:45 how it will be received by members of other alliances, who chose to attend this protest over working and setting up temporary stations. Unlike you, a member of the AEU who chose to set up temporary stations, over supporting your own alliance.
Take care:
Ather
