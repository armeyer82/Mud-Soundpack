-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

17:11 You're already sitting.

17:14 You remove a starship requisition application from a leather briefcase.

17:14 You scan the questions written on a starship requisition application and begin filling them out.

17:14 (15 seconds roundtime.)

17:14 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

17:14 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:22 You entered: First, I attempt to destroy any interdictors that may impede my escape. Following that, I engage any ships that would prevent my departure such as any chaining ships or ships that are interdicting. I then engage and attempt to destroy  as many of the remaining ships as I can one at a time. My first and foremost goal is to do everything I can to ensure that I have the ability to leave the sector if necessary. Second, I want to destroy as many of the enemy ships as I can so as to prevent them getting closer to civilian locations and providing a very real threat.

17:22 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:23 2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

17:23 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:29 You entered: I would still take the same approach as in the question above with the exception of the fact that I would alert everyone over tactical regarding my location, number, and class of ships. I also would request others to respond to assist. With it being a civilian location, it is my duty and responsibility to do everything I can to protect and defend it. Therefore, I would fight as long as necessary until the enemy is repelled or I run out of ships to fly.

17:29 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:29 3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

17:29 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:33 You entered: I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships depend largely on grid, I don't like running out of grid and the engineer can improve the recharge time of the grid by using advanced tools. Since the engineer needs to be settled in order to use them, I prefer to have the engineer always be ready to recharge the grid or patch the hull in case the ship is hit. 

17:33 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:33 4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

17:33 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey guys."

17:42 You entered: I notify everyone over tactical of my situation ensuring that I state number and classes of enemy ships. I then attempt to clear a way for me to leave the sector by destroying any interdictors if there are only a few of them and I try to destroy any ships that have me chained to them. If there are many interdictors and they are too spread out, I may not be able to destroy them before more are launched. My best option here then is to keep constantly moving away from the enemy to give the engineer time to repair the hull and for reinforcements to arrive. Landing in the sector is really the last thing I would do unless I felt I had no choice as the engineer cannot use advanced tools to patch the hull.

17:42 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:42 5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

17:42 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:45 You entered: We destroy any small ships that may have accompanied the mothership and leave the sector and notify both Steel Phoenix Command and Accord and don't return without a cruiser that as PDB shielding and battle suits. The last mothership could not be destroyed by conventional weapons so attacking it would be futile.

17:45 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:45 6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

17:45 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:49 You entered: My priority would be to protect primary beacon sectors and capitol planets. Primary beacon sectors are gateways to capitol planets and the enemy could inhibit a our ability to defend and protect the capitol planet by interdicting primary sectors. Capitol planets have the highest population of civilians and is home to our government and therefore should be protected.

17:49 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:49 7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?

17:49 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So how do I get to this beacon chain?"

17:51 You entered: I would carry out any orders the commander issued  and encourage my crew to do the same within reason.

17:51 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:51 8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issued missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?

17:51 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:53 You entered: I have flown in several salvage ops against, Omega Cartel, "Lambda Cartel and Merry Band ships. I have also responded and fought against siege forces both in AEU space and in other alliance space.

17:53 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:53 9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?

17:53 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:56 You entered: I still get hit more often than I'd like.
Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:56 10. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?

17:56 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:58 You entered: I expect it to stay undamaged less than a day as I plan to take it out and test it in a beacon as soon as I obtain one. I often get hit at least once during a decoy beacon drop.

17:58 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:58 11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?

17:58 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:59 You entered: I'm going to do everything I can to ensure it does not get destroyed, but if it does, it will most likely be during an invasion.

17:59 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:59 12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?

17:59 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

18:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also where are the new fighters?"

18:04 You entered: Defensive dissidence. I have the title of Phoenix Dissidence , and I obtained this ship to help defend the AEU.

18:04 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

18:04 13. You must choose a theme song that you will completely rock out to while fighting. What song do you choose?

18:04 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

18:05 You sign several notices and affirmations on a starship requisition application.

18:05 (60 seconds roundtime.)

18:05 You must be in a ship store to submit a starship requisition application

18:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sorry, I was filling out an application and you can get the new fighters on New Earth at the Blazing Trail place."

18:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, no worries."

18:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What are you applying for?"

18:08 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

18:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Constantine, just read the info which Melinda posted on the General Exploration messages Board. Initially though, just go to Campeche and one south to access the first beacon which is 271 It's been awhile so you actually might need to start fromCampeche itself. Then just follow the chain to 273 or 274. I forget which as I didn't pay a lot of attention to the messages since don't plan to go. Then after you get through the last beacon in the chain, use the heading posted."

18:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "So you progress from either 270 to 271, to 272, then to 273 or whichever beacons are applicable."

18:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "If you do plan to go, please hold off and I'll put up a Xenology station which will give the org some command at least even if you don't contribute points or funds and that will help us."

18:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay cool. Just didn't know it was Campeche. And will the ship follow the beacons automatically, or will I have to navigate to each one?"

18:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hold off on submitting artifacts that is."

18:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure thing."

18:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "It will if you don't intervene and press the fTL button."

18:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool."

18:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "As they are auto-nav."

18:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Any idea how long the chain is timewise?"

18:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've only taken it once and I want to say it was 4 hours or so, but I don't really remember."

18:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, it's an approval ship."

18:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

18:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Forget that."

18:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup one has to submit an applicaiton for one. I plan to try but my Bastille kind of beats me up a bit so hopefully I can better develop my solo skills as this seems like such a funship to fly."

18:38 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battle-Scanning Battery-Powered Temporary Station at Exploration Waypoint 51565 is now on emergency power.

19:08 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

19:13 [Tactical Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Ifs in a-19."

19:13 [Tactical Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Aries."

19:26 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:26 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:26 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:26 You're already sitting.

19:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:27 The ship is already moving.

19:27 The ship is already moving.

19:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Beacon A-19. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Spinward Cluster."

19:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:27 Streams of stellar gases and glittering clusters of debris unfurl in every direction in nearby space.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:27 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon A-19."

19:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:27 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

19:27 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

19:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:27 Via general sector communication, Beacon A-19 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Deadly Strike.' Welcome to Beacon A-19."

19:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:31 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

19:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:31 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

19:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:31 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

19:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

19:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

19:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:32 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

19:32 I don't understand that.

19:32 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:32 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:33 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:38 Minor Change: Starship ventilation ducts now require tools to open.

21:08 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

22:08 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

23:10 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

23:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of gravitic boost here.
You can go up and out.
