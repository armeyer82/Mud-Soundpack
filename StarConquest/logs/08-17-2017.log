01:09:54 [Starship "Effervescent Zephyr"; Control Room]

01:09:55 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

06:55:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

06:56:36 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Work that beautiful dark chocolate magic for us again Evenia."

06:56:42 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chortles.

06:56:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

06:57:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sorry bruh, an artifact is calling my name."

06:57:21 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Ruuuude ass artifact."

06:57:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli, do you think driving passengers around is against the spirit of the strike?"

06:57:25 [General Communication] Joel Kringle snickers.

06:57:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

06:57:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or is that okay since they're private citizens."

06:57:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

06:57:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. it doesn't bring in resources, but it does bring in infustry."

06:58:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."

06:58:41 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

07:05:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, by the way Constantine, SVP is fine too, since that's part of the Accord."

07:09:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, wish I could still do those."

07:10:41 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

07:12:18 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:12:34 [General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.

07:12:55 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "What is the theory behind black sunshine, then?"

07:12:59 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ooh.. this is nice. I approve of this rift."

07:13:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The theory behind black sunshine, is that she' sblack and shoots lots of lasers."

07:13:20 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Looks like I'm in a spider's nest."

07:13:41 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles.

07:13:41 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

07:13:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And the sun is a deadly laser."

07:13:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Now I'm trying to think of more shipnames to pick at."

07:14:43 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oo. What's the theory behind um...Is it horizons hope?"

07:15:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I already told you the reason for that one."

07:15:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah, but I don't remember."

07:15:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, for one, she was originaly going to be an exploration ship, but the idea is that when she crosses the horizin into a battle, she inspires hope because a cruiser just arrived."

07:16:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's right. I remembered the exploration part, but not that part."

07:16:40 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Also I just like the name Horizon Hope, damnit."

07:16:59 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I think tempered dragonfly is probably my favorite of your combat ship names though, other than sunshine."

07:18:19 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Actually wait, I lie. I love the name of your combat scout too."

07:20:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Owwww....broken arm first thing in the mornin....BoltSong's out for blood...ouch..."

07:20:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:20:47 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well then. Um...good painful wakin' cycle, Morris?"

07:21:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good mauling."

07:21:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh God! It's broken!"

07:21:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Owwww...yep..."

07:22:47 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The worst thing is when you're half awake. And you reach out to pet the felo that's all purring and rubbin' on the side of the bed. Only to realize too late. That it's evil. And you just got chomped."

07:22:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm. God, it hurts!"

07:23:38 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "When I was half asleep. I used to confuse lemnay and irokki all the time. Seein' as how they're both gold. That wasn't fun."

07:23:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

07:25:52 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Chomp."

07:26:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Right? Then you're awake."

07:26:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Quite."

07:26:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I dunno how many times I considered donating billions to my apartment complex to get them to install a medical facility."

07:26:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

07:26:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I hear ya on that one."

07:26:57 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Why not just buy your own personal medical creche."

07:27:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hey, that could work."

07:27:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well I'd do that too. If they were available, they'd certainly make money out of me."

07:31:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Would anybody be interested in a couple large aquariums of aquapedes?"

07:31:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You just said my weakness. I'll take 'em."

07:31:38 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I would take one."

07:31:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Where are ya Caleb?"

07:31:51 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I just would need to find a place for fish food."

07:32:09 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Bubbling but shall be on my way back soonish."

07:32:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Awesome caleb, you take at least one. I'm fish crazy."

07:32:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well if there's any left I'll take one, I don't have any."

07:32:52 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Eli can have the other Morris, if Caleb doesn't want them both."

07:32:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. Eve, you have a key to the tug. Caleb I'll send ya a key. There's a small aquarium and two large ones. Y'all two figure out which of the large ones ya want. I'm givin away the entire aquariums."

07:33:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok."

07:33:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eli. You close?"

07:33:52 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Alrighty."

07:33:56 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Thanks a lot."

07:34:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure thing."

07:34:55 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "One of these days, I will beat Eve to the claiming of adorable living things."

07:35:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

07:35:11 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Pillows are nice."

07:35:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hey. I gave up my claim. You want fish. I can give you fish. I've got way the fuck too many as it is."

07:35:39 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Funny thing is, I'm pretty sure that Eve has like eight and a half milion aquapeds already."

07:35:52 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er aquapedes."

07:36:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eli, if you're near Old Earth, you can come look at 'em."

07:36:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Otherwise I'll send ya a key."

07:36:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I do. Which is why I gave up my claim. I'm only hunting gold ones. Or ones with certain shells. And I've got tons of eggs I could share. No charge."

07:36:29 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I thought Caleb was taking them?"

07:36:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's two."

07:36:44 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But he's not taking both?"

07:36:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."

07:37:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah. That's why I said to Morris you could have the other one, when you called for it."

07:39:14 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I actually have a wall aquarium I've been considering giving away, fish and all."

07:39:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm makin keys now Eli, you want one or you wanna come over?"

07:39:58 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "One of those would be nice if I had an apartment."

07:40:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You can fit them inside a scout I think. But...I gotta cut down my fish somehow."

07:41:24 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I have space for fish."

07:41:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well then. We can talk fish. When I'm not bubbling. I'll gladly shair."

07:42:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah coughs. "Also share."

07:42:42 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the north.

07:43:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, lookin to trade soldiers with folks if anybody's up for it. I've got all red and dark red, so it's time for some new genes."

07:43:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "A few months ago. Sean was like "Hey Eve. I don't want these aquariums. Will you take them?" I said yes. not realizing how freaking many he had."

07:43:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wow."

07:44:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Exactly. I mean at least he did the right thing by the fish like. Not just starving them. But I'm overrun."

07:44:18 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

07:44:26 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "As for soldiers...Want some steel? I have steel."

07:44:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure."

07:44:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm kinda loathe to part with the dark reds as I ain't seen many of them, but I could probably part with one."

07:45:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm not too worried. These guys are breeding so much I'm getting a little worried about overcrowding, so I'll just give you some."

07:45:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's the key Caleb. In case I ain't round when ya get back."

07:46:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, I'm full too actually."

07:46:08 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:46:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'd have stuck around Morris, but I need to go buy fish food."

07:46:18 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "In that case...I'll just take a couple of the red."

07:46:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. Why I was thinkin bout tradin."

07:46:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok."

07:46:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And that's fine Eli."

07:46:42 Shine the big white glowing felo stares curiously up at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

07:46:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Caleb, feel free to hold onto that key. I let folks hang onto keys for the tug so in case nobody around who has felo of their own needs 'em for bari."

07:47:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "For some reason I can't figure out, the steels breed like crazy."

07:47:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "These guys do too. My soldier line's generally healthy but I have had some smaller and smaller sizes lately."

07:48:14 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "OH I also have a three-eyed somewhere here."

07:48:19 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I saw the most adorable tiny one when I checked on them when you were away. I was very tempted, but I didn't touch it."

07:48:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Go ahead if ya see one. I don't mind folks switchin 'em out."

07:49:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've got some really super-friendly ones on here too, includin at least one dark red."

07:49:15 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll remember that. I'd always trade for another of course."

07:49:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's fine."

07:49:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Now where'd that three-eyed felo disappear to...?"

07:49:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's watching you."

07:50:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I seriously can't find it."

07:50:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Not in the head?"

07:50:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. I found it. Lil nut nodded off in the gunner's chair."

07:50:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, you can have that one if ya want it too."

07:51:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "L trough."

07:51:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew coughs.

07:51:55 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks. When I get back I'll bring over the tug, and pop in a couple steel, and grab a couple of the red. I'll leave the dark red alone. Just let me know if you get a pile more of 'em."

07:52:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok."

07:52:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm also gettin vermillion on the HLV."

07:53:00 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I love that color. It seems to be the good luck color. My oldest pet is vermillion. She'd be over a year now."

07:53:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, me too. It's a nice color."

07:53:44 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I like how it looks with her armor plates."

07:53:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."

07:54:42 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

07:55:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Keegan, how's Scherzo doin?"

07:56:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oww...dang."

07:56:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

07:56:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man."

07:57:05 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Pizza party like a rockstar? I love you."

07:57:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Corvette beacons are worth so few points."

07:57:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But what can you do."

07:57:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The outsiders aren't going to space themselves."

07:58:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli, would it be insanity to outfit a carrier with a rift drive and enough sensor upgrades to fly out to a remote artifact field carrying a scout and a module scout."

07:58:42 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

07:58:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Set up a temp xenology station, and just live out there for a few days?"

07:58:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do people do that?"

07:59:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess it's moot since the carrier is the one ship I probably have no way to get to farport."

08:02:42 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

08:09:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, there's no reason why you couldn't do that, but you'd probably want to know what field you were going to first, the sensors on a carrier aren't too great for that. I believe they are classified as utility sensors."

08:10:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I figured I'd ask for a heading and go out to a known field."

08:10:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And yes, I believe thre's soem folks that do that. Aslo, there's not really any reason why you would even need to build the xenology station, you can always turn the artifacts in when you get back."

08:10:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that's true. I mainly just figured the station would be a good place to park the carrier."

08:11:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess all the xenology module would do is make its battery drain faster, though, huh?"

08:11:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But it's not a bad idea to do it. I think folks usually just plan artifact trips and go otu in groups though."

08:11:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I wouldn't want to be out for days alone."

08:11:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah it would, but again, it doesn't have to last for a week or anything."

08:13:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you have to have 300 exploration to get points for an alien artifact?"

08:13:42 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

08:13:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No idea on that one. I would imagine that if you can do it at the bubble, you can do it furhter out."

08:14:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but I'm wondering about people with like 40 exploration."

08:14:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they'd get anything."

08:14:30 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner". The organization has earned 576,094.02 credits.

08:14:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I don't think they would. But they can always hold onto the artifacts until they have enough."

08:14:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I imagine I'm the only person in the corps with more then 300 who would actually want to do this, since you, Shule, Lily, et al. Probably have thousands."

08:14:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Number of points doesn't always matter bud."

08:14:56 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 22,687,500.00 credits from a xenology submission.

08:15:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Certainly not, but it's still a whole lot of work for something you don't really need."

08:15:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Exploration and artifacts and things like that are my passion. I would do something like that are my passion."

08:16:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like I could kiss the bubble goodbye as soon as I have enough points to lead expeditions."

08:16:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "Oh constantine, I think you are slightly underestimating the number of points you need for certain exploration upgrades."

08:16:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And just do those."

08:16:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though maybe that's just because I've been doing it every day."

08:16:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh really? From Ather's book it looks like 3000 gets you everything."

08:16:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "To get the best probes, you need 20000."

08:16:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that not the case?"

08:16:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow."

08:16:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

08:17:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. What were we talking about that required 20000 points?"

08:17:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Exploration points are probably the main ones you always need, if you want to do those kinds of things."

08:17:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Planetary probes."

08:17:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, interesting."

08:17:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Lander probes require 15000 and the best lander requires 20000."

08:17:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So even if I got 3000 exploration in the next month, my probes would be terrible."

08:17:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Probes sound like a lot of fun."

08:18:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And my expeditions wouldn't be lucrative or enticing to most people."

08:18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actualy the 3000 probes are decent."

08:18:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that's good to hear."

08:18:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But folks don't get credit for them unless they qualify for them."

08:18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

08:18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So, maybe it would be good for someone to lead some with lower tier probes."

08:19:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like on the expidition I went on, I got credit for al the probes used that were under 5000, but I didn't get credit for any of the 5000 ones that got used."

08:19:09 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Uhhh, sleeping."

08:19:18 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Haven't seen any plants in a bit."

08:19:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you can carry different kinds of the same ship?"

08:19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."

08:19:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool."

08:19:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's so much about expeditions I don't know."

08:19:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The more you get it to love you, the more you'll see it do."

08:19:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Seems to be when they're in a new environment they don't do it quite so easily for awhile. But just wait till he stares into your heart and soul."

08:19:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That too."

08:20:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Right? The soul stair is...somethin' else."

08:20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And even if folks don't qualify for the spectrometry stuff, they'll still get at least partial credit for planet finds, even if they don't qualify for the surveyor."

17:58:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Excuse me is this just amongst a select few and if not, why weren't we all notified?"

17:58:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, since he didn't bother sending a communicator notice about it, and there was only like two of us here or something when he said it, you think you could send out a communicator notice from your terminal when you get a chance?"

17:58:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, good idea."

17:58:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, sure."

18:03:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

18:03:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Who knows, Lily. Maybe you are right about it being in his head? He did kinda seem like he just rolled over and said it and then went back to sleep. Hopefully it was not something he was supposed to confirm to Lambeth. There's always a chance we'll show up and no one will come because it wasn't confirmed."

18:04:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:04:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Right but we should show up in good faith at least."

18:07:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "When I was Voice, I don't remember ever seeing any sort of written agreement concerning the QSA or the Accord. However this doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. Just that prior Voice of the Corps individuals didn't maintain a hardcopy. I read everything in the file cabinet as tedious and as time-consuming as it was. Still its important. So yeah would likewise be curious about the prior agreement."

18:46:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Come to think of it, he did say it was about the Mutuality."

18:47:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok."

18:47:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I just assumed it was specifically about the negotiations."

21:43:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep."

21:43:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Does one give the terroreroticism vessel exploration-grade sensors?"

21:43:25 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:43:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep."

21:43:46 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:44:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's just a scaled won version of the platform, so I'm almost positive that it does."

21:44:13 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Anyone up for a nest?"

21:44:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It would but I'm not sure it would be worth the trouble."

21:44:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, maybe not."

21:44:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it would be faster than an exploration scout."

21:44:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't think the charge is that much on that particular ship?"

21:44:42 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "If it's a very simple one, I'm knackered."

21:44:52 [General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.

21:44:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not as fast as a void piercer, but at least the terroreroticism vessel would have guns."

21:45:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:45:06 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Like, if I can point and shoot, then yeah."

21:45:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Our scout is a much better ship for that class I'd think."

21:45:45 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "All I have to say is blame Rogue."

21:45:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You could put a plant on it to get it close to the speed, but yeah I agree with Lily on this one. Our long-ranged scout is pretty sweet."

21:45:57 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Why Rogue?"

21:46:11 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You might find out and you'll want to blame someone."

21:46:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you don't think it's armed enough, then you can get it augmented over at emerging technologies to give it six turrets."

21:46:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Our Scout is also faster."

21:46:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'll blame you."

21:46:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is it? I'm just going by the max cruising speed numbers in Ather's book."

21:46:56 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "That's a good fall back plan."

21:47:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.

21:47:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes it is not the Combat scout, our Exploration scout."

21:47:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, no max cruising speed bonus is listed for it."

21:47:23 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "What are we doing?"

21:47:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Is it Lily? The sped seems about the same as a gemini."

21:47:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's not really the armaments I care about, Eli."

21:47:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

21:47:35 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "A nest I guess."

21:47:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No it's not go look at the Status report."

21:47:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's just the max cruising speed."

21:47:53 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Angel, did you get a kitten?"

21:47:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though having at least one gun is handy."

21:48:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Otherwise the void piercer would be a no brainer."

21:48:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might still get one just for bubbling."

21:48:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll go look, but I'm fairly certain Ijust checked this the other day."

21:48:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The Void Piercer is faster but not that much faster and it has no weapons."

21:48:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but I think I could deal with the no weapon problem fairly easily out at the bubble."

21:49:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

21:49:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Normally I would gree, but the problem is that if pirates drop interdictors at the temp station, you are stuck."

21:49:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true, but I don't actually use my scout to fly to and from."

21:49:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I see."

21:49:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I keep it parked at the beacon. If hostile ships are present, I switch to a bastille."

21:50:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What I really need is for Best to stop being so shortsighted and sell me an Arrow."

21:51:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "For the Scout it is: Maximum velocity: 29630."

21:51:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do you have on that thing?"

21:51:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's not that far off form the Void Piercer. I sold my Void Piercer."

21:51:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As in what?"

21:51:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like even a 10% speed boost would save me tons of time, especially over hundreds of artifacting runs."

21:51:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

21:52:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well that's not the scout's base speed."

21:52:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mine doesn't go that fast."

21:52:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that with a plant?"

21:53:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I forget which plant this is it may be a sensor and speed plant but it doesn't increase it that much and what battery are you using and which engine?"

21:53:27 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

21:53:28 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock.

21:54:45 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

21:54:46 You can't go that way.

21:54:47 I don't see "lily" here.

21:54:48 You can't go that way.

21:54:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

22:03:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well there you go."

22:03:11 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "M e too."

22:10:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, Lily's scout's speed is about 11% more than mine."

22:11:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would expect that's the difference that a double-speed plant would give."

22:11:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I really don't know."

22:11:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

22:12:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My understanding was that the advanced upgrade only added guns at the cost of battery life."

22:12:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I reverted mine form advanced to it's original form. I didn't like it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But that does seem like an incredibly raw deal, considering there's an even better combat scout."

22:12:53 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Anybody need an expert damage output boost blueprint?"

22:12:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So maybe there are other bonuses."

22:13:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think the deal there, is that you need less points to get the advanced scout."

22:13:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that makes sense, then."

22:13:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nope. Though if blueprints could get warn out, mine would be."

22:13:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles.

22:13:46 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Mine would have been ages ago."

22:13:53 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't have any advanced blueprints."

22:13:57 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How much would you like for it?"

22:13:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And if I'm correct, the advanced scout would still be an exploration ship, and the combat scout is not."

22:14:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that makes sense."

22:14:15 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "1.5 billion credits."

22:14:16 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You won't be able to use it for awhile I image but consider it a gift."

22:14:35 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, thanks Mel. But what do I need to use it?"

22:14:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

22:14:54 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "5000 industry."

22:15:04 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah. I'm a ways off from that."

22:15:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident begins reading in a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

22:15:20 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But trust me. It'll come in very handy when you can use it."

22:15:36 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I found one of those the last time I went to GMG."

22:15:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there some tier between basic and expert?"

22:15:37 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "If you can get the parts to use it."

22:15:41 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's the output boost thing I always use on our beacons."

22:15:45 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Advanced."

22:15:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Improved."

22:15:48 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

22:15:54 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do those also come from GMG?"

22:16:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Basic, improved, advanced, expert."

22:16:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yes."

22:16:26 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But there are people that will craft things for you, if you ask nicely."

22:16:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You also need parts from GMG to make some of the stuff."

22:16:26 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ugh, I gotta get out there. My basic energy dumps aren't cutting the mustard."

22:16:33 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I wish I had the advanced tool set."

22:16:44 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

22:16:47 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

22:16:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I can make ya one Caleb."

22:17:00 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I could craft you that. I'd have to charge though. Those toolsets take a crap ton of parts."

22:17:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

22:17:13 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "That's cool how much morris?"

22:17:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lemme see."

22:17:45 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Constantine, what's your industry at the moment?"

22:17:56 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Also need an arti detector if anyone is trying to make some cash."

22:17:57 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "3440, but progress will be slow for a while."

22:18:04 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For political reasons."

22:18:04 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I can do that."

22:18:08 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I have the blueprint but don't have the parts."

22:18:14 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Yay."

22:18:25 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm still looking for the blueprint."

22:18:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "What parts do you need?"

22:18:44 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "In that case...You can use all the expert tools if I remember right, other than the output boost."

22:18:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You got any parts Caleb?"

22:18:59 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I think that's right, yeah."

22:19:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It takes glyph replicators, glyph energy sources and alien maintenance tools."

22:19:07 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Hmm let me see."

22:19:11 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool."

22:19:12 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I can get you an interrupt and sensor."

22:19:44 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Chat to me later dude and I'll craft you a set of experts."

22:20:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If ya have no parts, 350 mill Caleb. If ya do, we'll work it out."

22:21:20 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome, I will."

22:21:46 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I just need the small self-sustaining power source, passive quantum foam sensor, and autopilot override1 mel."

22:21:59 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

22:22:03 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Do you have any of those blueprints?"

22:23:22 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Better yet, 200 mill for the detector that I have crafted."

22:23:31 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Not that I see here, but I could be missing it."

22:23:38 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Cool."

22:23:38 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay."

22:23:44 [General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.

22:23:45 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Where to meet."

22:23:56 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am on the old earth pad."

22:26:08 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

22:26:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did they say what the meeting is about?"

22:26:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "As constantine said, its about the mutuality."

22:26:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok."

22:26:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok."

22:26:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And the botched skim negotations."

22:27:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."

22:27:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

22:28:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

22:28:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yeah good ridance loser!"

22:28:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Riddance."

22:29:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lily, shule. Has constantine had his talk with you two?"

22:29:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And you yourself Vernos are responsible for the 'regardless' part of your announcement. You did damage to our two best pilots."

22:29:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Or most senior who are active in the least!"

22:29:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What talk?"

22:30:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have I been having talks with people?"

22:30:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You were supposed to tell them what I asked you to about the eyes."

22:30:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The eyes, the eyes."

22:30:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm racking my brain."

22:31:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay I'll just spill it out."

22:31:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:31:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What drugs is this dude flipped out on?"

22:31:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think I remember."

22:31:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Because you are dissidents and in office, they will be watching you very closely."

22:31:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I think he is being paranoid. I wouldn't pay it any mind, honestly."

22:31:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:31:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That is always how it is Constantine. That is nothing new."

22:32:03 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

22:32:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:32:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That is a given Vernos whenever one is holding any Liaison position."

22:32:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah, I remember discussing this. I didn't think you meant for me to warn them."

22:32:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though yeah, I think office holders are always under scrutiny."

22:32:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I mean extra closely beyond that Lily."

22:32:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:32:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We are."

22:33:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Constantine it goes beyond the normal scrunity."

22:33:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They said this to you?"

22:33:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yup."

22:33:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's what Imentioned to you yesterday, about how the disiidents will be closely watched if they hold office and are being given a second chance to show that they were being manipulated by the rogues."

22:33:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What eli said."

22:34:03 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

22:34:11 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

22:34:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Because, you know, you guys wre totally manipulated."

22:34:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So my only concern with that is that it sounds like they'll use the dissidents taking office again to show that the corps now supports the government."

22:34:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's my concern too Contantine, but I suppose there's nothing that can be done about it now."

22:34:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The scrutiny doesn't sound like a big deal to me -- what is Lily going to, accidentally lead a ground mission in a really dissenting fashion?"

22:34:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:34:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well They know me fairly well by now and that I am probably one of the most independent individuals around which annoys many so I won't lose any sleep ofer this."

22:34:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they don't like the officers they'll remove them again."

22:35:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Until that happens it should be business as usual."

22:35:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:35:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yup."

22:35:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:36:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:36:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I didn't because that is not what I said and since I know what I said, I am comfortable with my own self."

22:36:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Just watch yourselves in office."

22:36:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That was my only warning."

22:36:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Tensions were high after the negotiations. Let's look forward to the meeting tonight and come up with a plan afterwards."

22:36:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well intention wth the warning."

22:37:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:37:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Vernos I have been a pilot long enough to know how to behave or not and how to face whatever consequences of my own actions occur. I've held every office here except SDC so."

22:37:39 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

22:37:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

22:38:03 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

22:38:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Besides, I haven't officially participated in the strike and i'm not worried about Eli or ather so he's just making a lot of rediculous noise and trying to stir up bullshit hehe."

22:38:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

22:38:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You've also held every office."

22:59:39 You say, "Held."

23:02:03 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

23:45:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

23:47:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You know Vernos so-called advice makes o sense. First off, Eli wasn't robued entirely for beind a dissident. Had neither of then gone on the expedition with aisling, I doubt they would be Rogued."

23:47:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Rogued that is."

23:49:05 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:49:30 You say, "Yeah, they probably wouldn't have been."
