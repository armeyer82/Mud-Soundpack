00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How's it going?"

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Medium well."

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It's going good!"

00:23 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What do you two have planned, or are considering in doing?"

00:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Wait, there's a plan?"

00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not really."

00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Well..."

00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. not really."

00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm... so close to getting that battery from frontier processor..."

00:27 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And, then I can get the junkdrive."

00:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You got rescued Constantine?"

00:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, Eve came and got me."

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What happened?"

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, like a dummy, I didn't realize that there were no inserters pointing back from 287."

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh damn, I'm sorry. I probably should have known that."

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eh, no worries. Now we know."

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How did you even get in touch with anyone?"

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Space telepathy?"

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

00:31 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "By good fortune."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well at least you probably god some good roids ou there."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. yeah."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nope."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, no, cause there's not even an inserter going from 287 ro 288."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To, rather."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. need a rift drive to get out there."

00:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well shit, sorry man."

00:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It was no big deal. At least we weren't stuck anywhere dangerous."

00:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Either of you want to git a Nest or.. someting?"

00:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Reminder to all pilots. A proposal of importance is up on the AEU voting machine. Vote on it, tell your AEU friends to vote on it too. It could determine a lot!"

00:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So close.. I can taste it!"

01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs assaults your ears with a burst of static and screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs, "WOO! 200!"

01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Now... where was that spacejet.. Torus?"

01:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."

01:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sweeeeeetness."

01:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey, constantine. It's 3000 industry OR 300 exploration."

01:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

01:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was thinking it was AND."

01:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh no. Like I was saying earlier, I got the industry first."

01:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Because that was easier for me."

01:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's a relief.... sort of."

01:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Do have to say though... a fair good price for it."

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The rift drive?"

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, they're costly."

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Half a bil."

01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The improved anchor is 250 industry.."

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, not too bad."

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yep."

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The fast engines are a serious boon, though. Last time I hauled I didn't even have the EAOS reactionless mark 2, and it was so much faster today."

01:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Fast engines are a boon to everything."

01:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's true."

01:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Fast engines, good battery."

01:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's all is needed for exploration, on a ship."

01:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh... and autovector."

01:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."

01:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For artifacting at least. I don't know how often those get used for other exploration."

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Besides the battery, obviously."

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Which? Autovector?"

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, does that get used on expeditions much?"

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I assumed expeditions were just rifting 90% of the time."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "No idea. Possiblely."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It can for artifacting, but no, not really."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Still useful to have, of course."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I think people used autovector to gather artifacts."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, and a pittance in cost compared to the other stuff you're likely to bring."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They did, but that doesn't always happen on expiditions."

01:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you're trying to hit a goal for example, you don't want to spend too much time doing anything else before you get there."

01:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's still something good to have if you need it, but for the actual just exploring part, you mostly just need rift drive and some good sensors."

01:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And cahrge, lots of charge."

01:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

01:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Scouts could be rented, right?"

01:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Having said that, I would still be pretty surprised to see an exploration ship without it heh."

01:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think they rent one at Tannhauser?"

01:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think it's for combat though, not really exploring."

01:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's' what I was wondering."

01:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Just calls it a deep space scout."

01:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm I don't know."

01:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hmm?"

01:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "About the rrental scout."

01:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It's 3.89 mil to rent.. for an hour. Not sure i'd use it for exploration..."

01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't want to be a bother... but do either of you want to go looking for local artifacts?"

01:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't currently. I'm probably not going to be doing much for the next 12 hours or so."

01:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Besides resting."

01:36 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

02:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Our performance was up 18.2% from the last Conquest period."

02:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm trapped on a station filled with bari."

02:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Currently having a cocktail with a bari."

02:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "How?"

02:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I was just kidding."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not really trapped."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm at the frontier cluster."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can leave but I won't be able to land again."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Was going to say, just launch."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right after I finish this Feng Wo dark."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Well.. I am so far east of battle of mir beacon. That I've run into... no more debris."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh nice."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We're there too but too lazy at the moment to do much so probably later today."

02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "He can leave, as long as the bsari don't eat him before he gets a chance too."

02:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

02:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "By the way, hello AEu."

02:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule."

02:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Any idea what the Pulsar's laser bonus is like?"

02:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ummm, 10 percent I think, but don't quote me."

02:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Anyone know how many sectors it is, before the debris ends? I've lost count."

02:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not sure, but there are mileage and mileage reset buttons on your console you can use to keep rough track of how far you've gone."

02:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think 20 sectors, but you should use your mileage meter."

02:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's also a really handy beacon autostop unit you should look into. Start your search by going down one, then in any direction, and when you're ready to go home just go up and return in the opposite direction."

02:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And you'll stop when you get back to the beacon."

02:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Unfortunately... right now it's too late to reset it."

02:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there any point in minicannons on a pulsar?"

02:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess you could use them if you want to save grid."

02:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, precisely. I use them to save grid at times."

02:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there any interesting torpedo that might be good on it?"

02:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or not really."

02:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The highest one is good, but I don't like weapons that require ammo."

02:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess there are those 5 second, 10% hull change guided torps."

02:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I feel you there."

02:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I only used torp launchers when I was pretty new at piloting becaus the lasers were a little on the low side The Eaos torpedo Launcher is very nice though. We may not be able to get those later on though."

02:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "HAving been stuck on a cruiser that ran out of ammo twice on a high beacon... I don't like ammo much. I was engineer for one of those times and we had a heavy assault chasing us all over the sector and we were chained. We couldn't shoot back at all."

02:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn."

02:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Who's ship was that?"

02:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, Ather had to come in with his flare and break us free so we could repair and rearm."

02:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or when the captain forgets to check ammo prior to departure and I've been in that predicament too and it was scarey as we had absolutely no ammo."

02:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice. Lasers to the rescue!"

02:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The flare is so strong."

02:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I love the flare!"

02:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sounds like league or fringe..."

02:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It was League ship and yeah Lily, it'snot fun."

02:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I'll be quiet as seems i'm just talking to myself anyway. Have a good morning."

03:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I responded toyou hun."

03:03 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

03:04 You glance at your communicator's screen.

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "777 all day."

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh..."

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Battle of mir or 777."

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I should've went to 777."

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The best part about 777 is that if you have a rift drive the direction you fly in doesn't matter."

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "777 unless they have totally changed it to some other Ftingy name."

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can just rift back to 777 when you're done."

03:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah. Nice."

03:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Glad that AEU pilots discovered it at least."

03:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Try AEU too1."

03:19 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

03:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Well, I'm... 20 some sectors east of battle of mir.. and only found one."

03:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah they are rather sparce in that area."

03:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So i've noticed..."

03:25 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.

03:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the north.

03:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Finding one more would be worth all this effort and time..."

03:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes all of her clothing, placing it carefully in a small suitcase.

03:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a small suitcase in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

15:31 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

15:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:31 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, sec."

15:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:32 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:32 Battlesuit Information:

15:32 
Active Battlesuit: EAOS Conjurer (Tier 4) [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
Stored:            League Templar (Tier 4) [New Earth]
                   Fringe Huscarl (Tier 4) [New Earth]
                   AEU Combat Universalist (Tier 5) [New Earth]
                   Fringe Hunter (Tier 2) [New Earth]
                   AEU Utility Combatant (Tier 3) [New Earth]

You have a total of five battlesuit slots.

15:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:32 Which sector did you mean?

15:32 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

15:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

15:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:32 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:32 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

15:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:32 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:32 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

15:32 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

15:32 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:32 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:33 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

15:33 You can go out and enter into the ship.

15:33 You exit the ship.

15:33 Board what?

15:33 [The Torus; Garage]

15:33 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

15:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:35 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:59 Star Conquest Help: Aerial Fortress and Deployment Station
--
Category: Ground Combat
--
An aerial fortress and deployment station (known more simply as an aerial fortress, or 'airfort') is a base of operations for a group of battlesuits. Aerial fortresses must also have a ship capable of transporting to the fortress to a mission area.

You can purchase an aerial fortress at any capital planet. The ship which can transport a fortress is classes as a "mule," and must be found elsewhere.

EQUIPPING AN AERIAL FORTRESS

First of all, you do not need your own aerial fortress, particularly if you're just starting out. There are probably a handful of aerial fortresses already owned by people in your alliance, and early on you will just be joining other pilots on one of these.

When or if the time does come to purchase your own aerial fortress, you can do so at the same facility where you purchased your battlesuit. You must already own a fortress-transporting ship in order to purchase a fortress.

There are some things you must buy in order to prepare your aerial fortress for combat.

* Synthesis supplies: An aerial fortress will synthesize all battlesuit ammunition from this as needed, so make sure you have plenty on board.
* Ammunition: Your fortress will often have to fight off defenders as it approaches a mission site. Its weapons require ammunition.
* Vehicles: If you're going to be performing more dangerous missions, you will often want surface assault vehicles and fliers on your fortress. Don't forget the ammunition that goes with them.
* Other supplies: Other items, like demolition charges, are quite good to have on board.

One thing you do not have to supply are battlesuits. Pilots will all bring their own when they board your aerial fortress.

DESCENDING TO A MISSION AREA

Once you have found a planet, space station, or other structure that can be attacked, you must move an aerial fortress to it with the help of a fortress-transporting ship (for instance, the Masterson Mule transport).

Once there, move into the aerial fortress's control room and type DESCEND.

At many locations, your fortress will be attacked as it descends! Fortunately, it has a starboard and port turret that can fend off attackers.

Weapons at each turret are:

* Lasers: For firing on targets alongside the fortress.
* Missile rear/forward: For firing on targets ahead of or behind the fortress.
* Grapeshot rear/forward: More of a passive defense that your target may fly into as it moves.

You must fight off your attackers by successfully keeping track of their position and firing weapons as appropriate from the correct turret.

As the aerial fortress takes damage, someone aboard should go into its engineering room and type REPAIR. Repairs will be ongoing as long as this room remains manned.

ARRIVING AT A MISSION AREA

Once you are
15:59  at a mission area, the first thing you will probably want to do is type REMOTE. This will send your airfort transport off to an adjacent sector where it is hopefully less likely to be disturbed.

Next, type SCAN. Your fortress's computer will analyze the situation provide you with one or more missions. On planets, your fortress will take time to move to the next mission.

FINISHING A MISSION

Once all battlesuits have launched and are back aboard, someone should type CLEAR to return them to storage. The fortress will also set about repairing them.

ONTO THE NEXT MISSION

Often the attack is over with the completion of a single mission. Operations on planets, however, are often much more complex. Return to the fortress control room and type SCAN once again to pick another mission.

LEAVING THE MISSION AREA

Once operations have concluded or you're done for the day, type REMOTE again to call back your fortress's transport. Once it has arrived, type ASCEND to return your fortress to the transport.

15:59 Johnathon Triggs's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What's the Nest?"

15:59 You press a button on the remote starship control board, sending the four-person mule "Lidia's Pride" safely away.

15:59 You press a series of keys, initiating a scan of the nest's interior. The strategic analysis computer churns through the information for a few moments, searching for the best point of entry.

15:59 A chime announces that the mission parameters have been entered successfully.

15:59 [Aerial Fortress "Stellar Haven"; Control Center]

15:59 The aerial fortress appears to be hovering just inside the entrance of a RATS nest. A screen is currently displaying a tactical map of a "Destroy Moderate RATS Nest" mission.

You see Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

15:59 An AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour suddenly splits down the front and deposits Johnathon Triggs.

15:59 You can't go that way.

15:59 You can't go that way.

15:59 Johnathon Triggs says into the PA microphone, "Fun."

15:59 Johnathon Triggs waves.

15:59 There is no battlesuit assigned to you present here.

15:59 Johnathon Triggs presses a button on an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

15:59 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves a Fringe Hunter from storage and sets it in front of you.

15:59 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.
The sounds of the aerial fortress's repairs abruptly cease.

15:59 You press a button on a Fringe Hunter, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

15:59 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

16:00 (20 seconds roundtime.)

16:00 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

16:00 (20 seconds roundtime.)

16:00 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

16:00 [RATS Nest; Drop Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This is just inside a location where the nest is open to space. Before you extends a series of tunnels, which are strangely organic-looking, yet clearly crafted from metal.
You can go west.

16:00 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour).

16:00 You peer west...

16:00 
[RATS Nest Interior] (inside a battlesuit)
This is the interior of the nest. There is no light here save that provided by battlesuit torches. Tunnels twist here and there, many too small for you to navigate. The walls possess a manufactured regularity, while the layout seems organic and unpredictable.
You see Sentry Horde Replicator and Enhanced Warrior Alpha here.
You can go east and west.

16:00 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant).

16:01 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Constantine Stone (League Infantryman).

16:01 Constantine Stone says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Yes."

16:01 You ask, "Ok, does anyone have sonics?"

16:01 Constantine Stone says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "How are you?"

16:01 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Negative."

16:02 Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

16:02 You say, "Ok, this ought to be interesting."

16:02 Constantine Stone says, "A moderate nest with no regen."

16:02 Constantine Stone laughs.

16:02 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah."

16:02 Johnathon Triggs says, "Uh.."

16:02 Constantine Stone asks, "How did we get moderate?"

16:02 Johnathon Triggs says, "I have some regen."

16:02 Katie grimaces.

16:02 Constantine Stone asks, "What tier is your fringe?"

16:02 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

16:02 Constantine Stone says, "Cool."

16:02 Johnathon Triggs says, "It's not a sqad regen."

16:02 Johnathon Triggs says, "Just a reconstruction ability."

16:02 You say, "Tier 2."

16:02 Constantine Stone says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Okay, I'll let them know."

16:03 Constantine Stone says, "Well, I believe in us."

16:03 "we can only do our best." Katie says, her accent growing thicker with tention.

16:03 Constantine Stone says, "Okay, I guess regen me when ready."

16:03 You nod.

16:03 Johnathon Triggs says to Constantine Stone, "Let me know when or where to hit you with a Reconstruction."

16:03 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Who's tanking."

16:04 You say, "Constantine is."

16:04 Johnathon Triggs says, "Constantine."

16:04 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Understood."

16:04 You say, "Hang on a sec."

16:04 Johnathon Triggs says, "He's point."

16:04 You say, "Give me a moment."

16:19 This is the interior of the nest. There is no light here save that provided by battlesuit torches. Tunnels twist here and there, many too small for you to navigate. The walls possess a manufactured regularity, while the layout seems organic and unpredictable.
You see Sentry Horde Replicator and Enhanced Warrior Alpha, Overseeing Replicating Kinetic Sentinel Beta, Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant) (in cover), Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour) (in cover), an energy bottle, a small pile of half-synthesized metals, a portion of a RATS constructor, and a portion of a RATS deep space battery here.
You can go northeast, southeast, and southwest.

16:20 Johnathon Triggs sighs.

16:20 Cadet Katie Celayla sighs.

16:20 You say, "It's rarely a good idea to take cover. Better to launch out."

16:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So do we have any hope of doing this?"

16:20 I don't understand that.

16:20 Try this instead:  repair

16:20 You detach a one-use repair drone.

16:22 Johnathon Triggs speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Can we launch, then try this mess again?"

16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They're both back."

16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I imagine we'll never beat them, but I'll try again if you guys want to."

16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "28%."

16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "WE canm, but we need Constantine to come down and flare so we can get out. Or we'll all pop."

16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can do that."

16:22 You detach a one-use repair drone.

16:23 Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour) (in cover) detaches a one-use repair drone.

16:23 Overseeing Replicating Kinetic Sentinel Beta charges northeast!

16:23 Sentry Horde Replicator and Enhanced Warrior Alpha charges northeast!

16:24 You say, "Launch."

16:24 You say, "Now."

16:24 Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour) (in cover) appears from behind a thick conduit lying across the floor.

16:24 Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant) (in cover) appears from behind a thick conduit lying across the floor.

16:24 You say, "Go."

16:24 Johnathon Triggs lights his battlesuit's ascent rockets and begins speeding upwards.

16:24 Cadet Katie Celayla lights her battlesuit's ascent rockets and begins speeding upwards.

16:24 You appear from behind a thick conduit lying across the floor.
Repair drone wears off.
(2 seconds roundtime.)

16:24 You light your battlesuit's ascent rockets and begin speeding toward the waiting aerial fortress.

16:24 (20 seconds roundtime.)

16:24 Wait 12 seconds.

16:24 Wait 3 seconds.

16:24 Wait 2 seconds.

16:24 Wait 1 second.

16:24 [Aerial Fortress "Stellar Haven"; Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

16:24 The aerial fortress appears to be hovering just inside the entrance of a RATS nest.
You see Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour) and Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
You rocket through the fortress's entrance hatch and stumble to a stop on the deck.

16:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Launch constantine."

16:24 [Aerial Fortress "Stellar Haven"; Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

16:24 The aerial fortress appears to be hovering just inside the entrance of a RATS nest.
You see Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour) and Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

16:24 An AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour suddenly splits down the front and deposits Johnathon Triggs.

16:25 [Aerial Fortress "Stellar Haven"; Deployment]

16:25 You see a Fringe Hunter here.
Johnathon Triggs and Cadet Katie Celayla are standing here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
You collect the items you retrieved from the battle and place them into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.
A crane descends from the ceiling and efficiently returns all battlesuits in the area to storage.

16:25 Constantine Stone abruptly rockets in through the entrance hatch, having returned from the surface, and stumbles to a stop on the deck.

16:25 I don't understand that.

16:25 A League Infantryman suddenly splits down the front and deposits Constantine Stone.

16:25 You say, "Wow."

16:25 Johnathon says to Constantine Stone, "They went looking for you."

16:25 You say, "Yeah, thought they might do that."

16:25 Constantine Stone says, "Nice."

16:25 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "They looooove you."

16:25 You chuckle.

16:25 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Repair and reenter?"

16:25 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Sounds good ta me."

16:26 Constantine Stone says, "We can try, but I doubt we'll be able to handle them now, especially."

16:26 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Or we could go find another est.."

16:26 Constantine Stone says, "Since they'll be waiting as soon as we land."

16:26 Johnathon Triggs nods.

16:26 You nod.

16:26 Cadet Katie Celayla nods.

16:26 Constantine Stone says, "That just smells like me being at 40% before anyone else even gets out the drop pod."

16:26 Johnathon Triggs says, "That's if they're together.."

16:26 Constantine Stone says, "They are."

16:26 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "New nest. Then."

16:26 You say, "They will be."

16:26 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "They're more chummy than princess league and, well, nevermind."

16:27 You say, "It'll be similar with this set up."

16:27 Constantine Stone says, "I don't think I've ever seen that pairing on a moderate."

16:27 Constantine Stone says, "We almost had it."

16:27 You say, "I actually think we should have taken out beta first."

16:27 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, you should have said. I had no idea which would be better."

16:27 Johnathon Triggs says, "We took down the shrew.. then we were taking to much damage when you popped."

16:27 Constantine Stone says, "I assumed the shrew would die faster."

16:28 Constantine Stone laughs.

16:28 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I saw."

16:28 You say, "I wasn't sure though."

16:28 A quiet beep serves to notify you that the aerial fortress has completed repairs of all stored equipment.

16:28 Johnathon Triggs walks northwest.

16:28 You say to Katie, "Do you have preemptive?"

16:28 Johnathon Triggs walks in from the northwest.

16:28 Johnathon Triggs says, "Suits are repaired."

16:28 You nod.

16:28 Cadet Katie Celayla asks, "Pre what?"

16:29 Constantine Stone says, "Preemptive repair."

16:29 You say, "Preemptive repair."

16:29 Cadet Katie Celayla asks, "No?"

16:29 Johnathon Triggs says, "Not sure that I can..."

16:29 Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

16:29 You say to Johnathon, "It's an AEU suit ability."

16:29 Johnathon Triggs says, "Ahhh."

16:29 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

16:29 Johnathon Triggs says, "Wonder what the Rental can do.."

16:29 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Not to my knowledge. Only ability I have is minor repair."

16:30 You say, "Ok."

16:30 Cadet Katie Celayla sighs.

16:30 Johnathon Triggs says, "We... really need a higher tier AEU suit for this.... hole."

16:30 You say to Johnathon, "What all do you have on your suit?"

16:30 Johnathon points northwest.

16:30 Johnathon Triggs walks northwest.

16:31 You say, "I can't see all of the abilities."

16:31 Johnathon Triggs's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Microrestroration, Reconstruction Mircrodrones."

16:31 Johnathon Triggs walks in from the northwest.

16:31 You say to Johnathon Triggs, "Did you keep reconstructive microdornes going?"

16:32 You ask, "Or just did it once?"

16:32 Constantine Stone says, "I should have asked them both to repair me at all costs once I hit 80%."

16:32 You say, "I couldn't tell. I was too busy shooting."

16:32 Constantine Stone says, "Though maybe you both were."

16:32 Johnathon Triggs says to you, "It takes time to recharge."

16:32 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "I was repairing as much as possible, but mine has a ten second cooldown."

16:32 Constantine Stone nods.

16:32 You nod to Johnathon Triggs. "I know."

16:32 Johnathon Triggs says, "I know I was using microrestoration as much as I could."

16:32 Constantine Stone says, "Well, it was a tough pairing."

16:32 You say, "Ah, ok."

16:32 Constantine Stone says, "Without regen that's pretty tough."

16:32 You say, "I figured as much."

16:32 Johnathon Triggs nods.

16:33 Constantine Stone says, "I'm not surprised they got us."

16:33 You say, "If we do another nest, we need to try different suits or it'll be similar."

16:33 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

16:34 You say, "Sec."

16:34 You see a League Infantryman here.
Cadet Katie Celayla, Constantine Stone, and Johnathon Triggs are standing here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

16:34 Johnathon Triggs says into the PA microphone, "Blind the SHREW, take out the ORK, and see how that would work?"

16:34 You say, "Yeah, that sounds like it might work."

16:35 Constantine Stone says, "We can try it if you guys want, but again, they'll be waiting as soon as I land."

16:35 You say to Constantine, "Be reeady to take cover."

16:35 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Perhaps try that in a new nest..."

16:35 You say, "Actually, everyone."

16:35 Johnathon Triggs says, "So we need to launch together."

16:35 Constantine Stone asks, "So we should cover up immediately?"

16:35 Johnathon Triggs presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour from storage and sets it in front of him.

16:35 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

16:35 You nod.

16:35 Constantine Stone says, "Okay."

16:35 Cadet Katie Celayla presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AEU Light Combatant from storage and sets it in front of her.

16:35 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

16:35 Constantine Stone presses a button on a League Infantryman, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

16:35 Johnathon Triggs says, "Yeah."

16:35 Two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend from the ceiling and close around Constantine Stone (League Infantryman). The sealed drop pod is quickly hauled into position at the launch tube, then disappears at a high rate of speed.

16:35 Cadet Katie Celayla presses a button on an AEU Light Combatant, which splits open down the front. She carefully climbs inside.

16:35 You press a button on a Fringe Hunter, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

16:35 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

16:36 (3 seconds roundtime.)

16:36 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

16:36 [RATS Nest; Drop Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This is just inside a location where the nest is open to space. Before you extends a series of tunnels, which are strangely organic-looking, yet clearly crafted from metal.
You see Sentry Horde Replicator and Enhanced Warrior Alpha, Overseeing Replicating Kinetic Sentinel Beta, Constantine Stone (League Infantryman) (in cover), and Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour) (in cover) here.
You can go west.

16:36 Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant) quickly takes cover behind a boulder-like lump of metallic slag.

16:36 Johnathon Triggs says, "Hello, gents.."

16:36 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant) (in cover).

16:36 Constantine Stone says, "Actually if I had used a second drone earlier in the fight I think we would have won handily."

16:36 Constantine Stone says, "I just didn't think about it until I was at 80%."

16:36 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "This scene looks familiar."

16:36 You chuckle.

16:37 Constantine Stone asks, "Okay, ready?"

16:37 Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

16:37 Constantine Stone says, "Give me a change to flare before you guys pop out."

16:37 You nod.

16:37 Johnathon Triggs asks, "What about detonators?"

16:37 Cadet Katie Celayla asks, "I have a couple deternators, they any use?"

16:37 You ask, "Targeting beta?"

16:37 Constantine Stone says, "Yep."

16:37 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "When, and when, heheh."

17:11 Cadet Katie Celayla presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

17:11 [Starship "Lidia's Pride"; Control Room]

17:11 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a gold destination finder here.
Johnathon Triggs and Cadet Katie Celayla are standing here.
You can go south and out.

17:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:11 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm worried we'll be clearing mother nests before long."

17:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:11 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

17:11 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:11 Cadet Katie Celayla stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Gah.. can you imagine that suit on a Mother nest?"

18:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Woo. 201 ground."

18:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs cheers.

18:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"

18:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yep! Laser rifle!"

18:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I wonder what I get for chainguns..."

18:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm.... lasers.. or chains... had choice."

18:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never used a suit with chains."

18:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't like the idea of buying ammo... But.. it's not bad in most cases. Expect for Bari."

18:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Lasers aren't really great against bari either."

18:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But at least you won't run out of ammo, true."

18:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But... but.. if you see the damage output on this repeating rifle.. man.. oh, man... I'm drooling."

18:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, ".... wow.... this makes short work of drones in a hurry..."

19:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Though, the fire time between shots.. and that of a laser, doesn't make all too a differance.. in the end."

19:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Think... I'll definately stick with lasers. But, it's fun to trash drones with these chainguns."

19:16 [MTTS] usfolks: Sorry to repeat the traceback. I thought I mistyped it. No clue why that would traceback...

19:19 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

19:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Was Frontier Processor ever purged, yet?"

20:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What's a reasoable alloted time to explore for artifacts, Eli?"

20:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "With auto-vector?"

20:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You may be asking the wrong person, because I just tend to do it and do it unti li have some other reason to stop."

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So my answer would be, um hours."

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ahh."

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I guess I am mainly looking for a minimum time frame."

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you aren't having any luck, try changing your direction, or even just moving up or down a few sectors and head back the other way."

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I tend ot travel in a downard spiral. I make a full circuit, changing after each artifact, then drop down one and start it over."

20:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But that's just me, I think a lot of olks just head straight. Also it can get confusing to get back that way unless you are near an auto-travel destination."

20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't think I'll be doing much local artifact gathering till I can get autovector... unless I go with someone else. Doing the way I was doing it, was very tedious."

20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And painful."

20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I mean doing it without auto-vector is doable, but having it is almost a must for efficient artifacting."

20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes."

20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I traveled close to 60 sectors without autovector... and only found artifact. Took me three hours. I was pained."

20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Erm.. only found 1 artifact."

22:45 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:45 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.

23:16 This is a letter. It is addressed to Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident, and was sent by Evenia Callseah.

23:16 --

23:16 Shule,
This letter is to let you know that there are starving felo on Effervescent Zephyr.
I've seen you going in and feeding them, so I'm writing to you.
If you're tired of doing it which I wouldn't blame you for, send me the key so that I can take them to the sanctuary, and she can just get more if anyone will give them to her.
This is not how felo should be treated.
If you do want to continue caring for them, please come and fix this as soon as possible.
Thank you,
Evenia Callseah.

23:16 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:16 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:16 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:16 You crumple up a letter and throw it in a nearby garbage can.

23:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:16 The ship is already moving.

23:16 The ship is already moving.

23:16 The ship is already moving.

23:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

23:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:16 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

23:17 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:17 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

23:17 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

23:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:17 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

23:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:17 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

23:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:17 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:18 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:18 [Starship "Effervescent Zephyr"; Control Room]

23:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad.

23:19 Tamra Swenson (asleep)
She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and has freckled skin. Her body is a bit thinner than average with attractively curved hips and pleasantly curved calves. She has angular shoulders and slightly smaller than average breasts. Her abdomen is firm and punctuated by a small navel. Her face is heart-shaped, lightly-freckled, and subtly asymmetrical, with a delicate nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-grey and narrow. Her shoulder-length, wavy hair is coppery red and swept back from her face into a mass of tousled curls. She has long clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a vividly painted red and gold dragon mask with gleaming white teeth and curved golden horns, a short dark red cotton tee with a glittery shooting star printed on the front, a tasteful silver watch with diamond accents, a silver link chain with a red jasper rose suspended from it around her waist, a pair of faded red low rise cut-offs, and a pair of cross-strapped light brown leather sandals. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a light metallic gray flightbag with a multicolored spiral galaxy on the side, a tyrian purple swivel einrophone in a golden brown reinforced plastic phone holster, a compact metallic royal purple camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the front wi
23:19 th a glittery royal purple camera strap, a metachannel FTL communicator, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, a black velvet backpack, a black silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered red dragons, a silver link bracelet decorated with small black and red jasper roses, and a bright orange 'FENG WO' canvas shopping bag. Her head, both eyes, neck, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, left wrist, both hands, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

23:19 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

23:19 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:19 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:19 You sniff absently at the air.

23:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

23:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:20 Which sector did you mean?

23:20 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

23:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:20 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:20 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:20 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

23:20 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:20 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:20 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

23:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:20 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 419" has jumped into the sector.

23:20 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 419! Welcome to home space!"

23:20 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 419" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

23:20 The ship's current engine speed is 6857 km/s.

23:20 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 5.2 seconds.

23:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:21 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

23:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:21 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

You slide a pair of white socks onto your feet.
You pull a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers onto your feet.
You've put on everything that you can here.

23:27 [Starship "Israel Hope"; Shower]

23:27 This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go out.

23:27 [Starship "Israel Hope"; Living Quarters Block]

23:27 You see an overstuffed black sofa and a cherry coffee table here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

23:28 You can't go that way.

23:28 [The Torus; Garage]

23:28 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

23:28 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

You can go south and out.

23:28 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:28 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

On the east side of it is a squarish white building, its plain facade decorated with a painted arch formed of the colorful silhouettes of small cat-like creatures. In the center of the wall is a small door with a large sign that you can LOOK at beside it and a bright red box marked 'Donations!' beneath it.

23:39 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

23:40 The starship is already moving.

23:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:40 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:41 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:41 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:41 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Slow Money! Welcome to home space!"

23:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:41 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
