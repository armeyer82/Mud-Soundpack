00:01 Keegan Wantz says, "Charging should be done any moment now."

00:01 Keegan Wantz strides north.

00:01 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Someone want to salvage a little bit?"

00:01 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Looking at these superheated masses."

00:01 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Should be ready to move in about four minutes, I think."

00:04 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Oh. Sure."

00:04 Clarina Taylor wanders north.

00:06 The blast chamber shuts down, having fully charged the starship.

00:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:22 Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.

00:22 Clarina Taylor sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

00:34 Hawthorn Dunn presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

00:35 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:35 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Onward!"

00:35 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:35 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:35 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

00:35 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

00:35 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

00:35 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

00:36 The starship has left a unique area of space.

00:36 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

00:36 Keegan Wantz strides north.

00:36 Hawthorn Dunn waves.

00:36 Ryan Thomas waves.

00:36 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

00:37 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "We still have outsider friends?"

00:38 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

00:38 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nah, they fell off a long time ago."

00:38 Hawthorn Dunn navigates his slate blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

00:38 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

00:38 Keegan Wantz strides north.

00:38 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gonna offset for about 15% of the charge."

00:39 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Yup! Gotcha."

00:39 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Then we'll have almost seven and a half days of charge to get home."

00:39 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Should be plenty, if we don't hit a calm."

00:39 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

00:39 Keegan Wantz strides north.

00:40 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

00:40 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Think we can get back faster if Ather uses his chart thing since we're not uh... gonna be zigging and zagging?"

00:40 Hawthorn Dunn waves.

00:40 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Charts have a finite range, it's only about as much range as the short range NDB."

00:40 Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

00:40 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Right, but as soon as we get in that range I mean..."

00:40 Hawthorn Dunn shrugs.

00:42 Keegan Wantz nods.

00:42 Keegan Wantz says, "Won't be for a bit."

00:42 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Gonna take a quick shower, back in a bit!"

00:42 Hawthorn Dunn waves.

00:42 Keegan Wantz says, "Keep an eye out for more patrols, we're not out of the woods yet."

00:42 Keegan Wantz strides north.

00:50 Blake Madison chuckles.

00:50 Blake Madison places Tony Cross on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

00:50 Blake Madison places Simon Collins on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

00:50 Blake Madison says, "If those quarters weren't locked, we could put them on the bunks."

01:05 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

01:10 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

01:12 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

01:12 Keegan Wantz stretches.

01:12 Keegan Wantz strides north.

01:13 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

01:13 Blake says to Keegan Wantz, "Feel better?"

01:13 Keegan Wantz nods.

01:13 Hawthorn Dunn says, "We didn't explode in fiery death, just so you know."

01:13 Keegan Wantz says, "I noticed."

01:13 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

01:17 Keegan Wantz asks, "Did everyone enjoy my silly tales?"

01:17 Keegan Wantz applauds sedately.

01:17 Blake Madison says, "Absolutely."

01:18 Blake says to Keegan, "Where did you get the ships from?"

01:18 Keegan Wantz says, "Icy, I think."

01:18 Keegan Wantz says, "I didn't ask for them, in either case, but I think they were a nice touch."

01:18 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

01:19 Blake Madison grins.

01:21 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

01:31 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

01:34 Keegan Wantz says, "I like this one."

01:34 Hawthorn Dunn says, "It's the best I've seen."

01:34 Keegan Wantz says, "Reminds me of space creatures."

01:34 Keegan Wantz yawns.

01:35 Keegan Wantz says, "With all that excitement earlier, gonna take a relatively short nap."

01:35 Ryan Thomas says, "Space squids."

01:35 Ryan Thomas exclaims, "So much excitement!"

01:35 Keegan Wantz says, "Wake me up in a few hours if I'm not alive by then."

01:35 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

01:35 Ryan Thomas says, "Will do."

01:35 Keegan Wantz strides north.

01:35 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

01:35 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:35 Keegan Wantz says, "Won't hit 15% charge for a long while."

01:35 Keegan Wantz says, "Er, 85%."

01:35 Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

01:35 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I shall hold down the fort. Wait, are we in a fooh, no, we're inside of a submarine right now."

01:35 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he sighs.

01:36 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Hold down the fort!"

01:36 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Indeed!"

01:36 Keegan Wantz strides north.

01:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:36 Lily rubs her eyes.

01:37 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

01:37 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

01:42 Lily Kaise stands up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

01:42 Lily Kaise glides north.

01:42 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters after Lily Kaise.

01:57 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

01:57 Lily Kaise sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

02:01 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Why is there a robot moving!?"

02:01 Blake Madison says into the PA microphone, "Huh?"

02:01 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, it was probably feeding someone's dumb animals."

02:01 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh uh I mena, lovely animals."

02:03 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Yes my glorious fishes and anyone elses."

02:04 Clarina Taylor switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

02:04 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "She was going to go shortsheet your bed Jammers."

02:07 A massive sphere looms ahead of the hovertruck, soon becoming evident as a slow-rolling ball of tentacles. The truck moves around it smoothly.

02:17 The hovertrailer carrying you fishtails briefly.

02:20 Lily Kaise stands up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

02:20 Lily Kaise glides north.

02:24 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok hot tub is reassembled in the room adjacent to the Weapon Room called happy. Enjoy!"

02:25 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

02:25 Lily Kaise sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

02:28 A giant spider dashes up to the hovertruck bed, coming from behind at terrible speed. It crawls over you quickly and disappears into the distance.

02:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

02:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:36 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Mhm."

02:36 Hawthorn Dunn scrambles to his feet.

02:36 Hawthorn Dunn ambles west.

02:38 A giant spider dashes up to the hovertruck bed, coming from behind at terrible speed. It crawls over you quickly and disappears into the distance.

02:39 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

02:39 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

02:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:54 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

03:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:15 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

03:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:25 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

03:32 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

03:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:42 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

03:46 The room grows a bit warmer.

03:48 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

03:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:52 Lily Kaise takes off a reactionless spacesuit jet.

03:52 Lily Kaise puts a reactionless spacesuit jet in a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

03:57 Alko Delovega schlepps north.

04:19 Blake Madison says, "Yaes."

04:19 Blake Madison says, "Yes."

04:22 Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:22 Keegan Wantz strides north.

04:22 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

04:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:33 Something tickles the back of your neck.

04:33 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in.

04:33 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the north.

04:33 Hawthorn Dunn ambles west.

04:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

04:41 The room grows a bit more chill.

04:42 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

04:43 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

04:43 Keegan Wantz stretches.

04:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:12 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

05:20 Gonzales Bourne sprints in.

05:22 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

05:23 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

05:25 Keegan Wantz says, "Well, maybe can do another thing tomorrow around midnight."

05:25 Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

05:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:28 Keegan Wantz says, "Hum."

05:28 Keegan Wantz strides north.

05:34 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

05:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:44 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

05:44 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

05:44 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

05:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:14 A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to a viewport.

06:20 Gonzales Bourne disbands his group.

06:20 Gonzales Bourne sprints north.

06:21 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the north.

06:25 The curtains of silken webbing billow outwards as if blown in a wind that can't be felt.

06:27 You say to Lily, "I'm going to head to bed I think."

06:46 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

06:46 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

06:46 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

06:47 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

07:49 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

07:49 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

07:50 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

07:50 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

07:50 You begin dry heaving.

07:51 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

07:52 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.

07:52 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

07:52 The room begins spinning around you.

07:52 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

07:52 You gag slightly.

07:53 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

07:53 You gag slightly.

07:53 The stage lights flicker briefly.

07:53 The room begins spinning around you.

07:53 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

07:53 The room begins spinning around you.

07:53 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "This 'roid cluster is destroying us."

07:54 You begin dry heaving.

07:55 You gag slightly.

07:55 You gag slightly.

07:55 You hear a wet tearing sound.

07:56 You gag slightly.

07:56 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

07:56 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

07:56 Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:56 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gotcha."

07:57 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

08:17 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

08:18 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

08:18 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

08:18 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

08:18 The starship has left a unique area of space.

08:18 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

08:18 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

08:48 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

08:58 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

09:09 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

09:19 A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.

09:21 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

09:21 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

09:34 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo, who all's awake?"

09:46 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

09:56 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

10:07 Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.

10:18 The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and closing. It then abruptly swims off.

10:21 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

10:22 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

10:23 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

10:44 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Riftstorm."

10:44 Matteo Hapta's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What shall we do about it."

10:44 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ignore it."

10:45 Matteo Hapta's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

10:45 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We might run into it."

10:45 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh!"

10:51 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

11:01 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

11:11 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

11:21 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

11:22 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

11:22 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

11:52 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

12:02 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

12:13 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

12:23 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

12:23 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

12:24 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

12:25 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

12:52 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

13:02 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

13:13 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

13:23 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

13:25 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

13:25 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

13:54 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morning."

13:55 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

14:01 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Location."

14:01 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Veil of pride?"

14:01 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Probably artis, want to bring us in?"

14:03 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

14:03 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

14:03 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

14:04 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

14:05 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

14:15 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

14:21 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

14:21 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

14:22 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

14:24 Flames flicker on either side of the conveyor belt as the air grows hot.

14:24 The heat lessens just slightly.

14:25 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

14:25 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

14:26 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

14:26 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

14:26 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.

14:27 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

14:27 The room begins spinning around you.

14:28 You begin dry heaving.

14:28 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

14:29 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

14:29 The crowd stands up to jeer. The room seems to spin rapidly around you.

14:29 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

14:29 The room ceases to spin.

14:29 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

14:29 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

14:29 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Such a short fun."

14:30 You gag slightly.

14:30 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

14:30 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That thing is going to knock out our sensors I think if we hit it."

14:30 You begin dry heaving.

14:30 You hear a wet tearing sound.

14:31 You gag slightly.

14:31 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

14:31 Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

14:31 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

14:31 Lily Kaise glides out.

14:32 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Grade eighty and 90 shiprecks."

14:32 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

14:32 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

14:32 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

14:32 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

14:32 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "See you later Gonzales!"

14:34 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey Gonzales will you be about at all in the next few hours? I'm not really sure how focused I'm gonna be today, feeling off."

14:34 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Unfortunately not."

14:34 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "But people should start waking up soon."

14:34 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay. Okay."

14:34 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ahem."

14:34 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Don't mind me, I'm sounding funny."

14:42 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

14:43 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

14:43 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

14:43 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

14:43 The starship has left a unique area of space.

14:43 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

14:43 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

14:43 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

14:43 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

14:43 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Do worms have vesiles which enter humanholes?"

14:43 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Uh..."

14:44 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes? Also we're gonna need repairs it seems."

14:44 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeh."

14:44 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

14:48 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're inside."

14:48 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup!"

14:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:53 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Off we go."

14:53 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

14:54 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

14:54 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

14:54 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

14:54 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

14:55 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

14:56 A card is slapped down next to the ship. It reads, "All Special Effects Nullified!"

14:56 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

14:56 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

14:57 Dice roll, and the ship is advanced around a corner of the board.

14:58 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

15:24 You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.

15:34 A strange-looking starship approaches from behind, being lifted and placed by a giant hand one square at a time. It advances a few spaces beyond your ship and stops.

15:34 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morning!"

15:35 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi."

15:35 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi storm."

15:35 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's baaack!"

15:45 You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.

15:45 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Do we have muffins?"

15:54 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

15:54 Listen. You need to be careful.

16:23 It's not always about where you're going.

16:24 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

16:24 Do you know what they want?

16:25 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heart heart heart."

16:35 You should keep your room locked while you sleep.

16:37 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

16:47 The computer announces, "Incoming QE message from AFW Command."

16:47 They stare at you. Of course they do.

16:51 The computer announces, "QE message from AFW Command received."

16:52 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That was... enlightning."

16:52 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think they meant okay?"

16:57 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nah, might've just been OH."

16:57 Remember what I said.

16:57 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

16:57 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh."

17:10 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alright I have to doze off for a couple hours just so everyone knows."

17:27 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

17:34 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

17:34 Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

17:34 Lily Kaise pulls a dark pink synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars printed on the chest off.

17:34 Lily Kaise puts a dark pink synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars printed on the chest in a small suitcase.

17:35 Lily Kaise removes a pair of skinny stonewashed purple lowrise jeans with amethyst and deep purple jeweled seashells on the front pockets from a small suitcase.

17:35 Lily Kaise puts a pair of skinny stonewashed purple lowrise jeans with amethyst and deep purple jeweled seashells on the front pockets in a small suitcase.

17:35 Lily Kaise removes a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans from a small suitcase.

17:35 Lily Kaise pulls a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans on over her legs and wiggles furiously, tugging them into place.

17:35 Lily Kaise removes a short lavender cotton tee with a glittery shooting star printed on the front from a small suitcase.

17:35 Lily Kaise pulls a short lavender cotton tee with a glittery shooting star printed on the front on over her head.

17:35 Lily Kaise removes a pair of mystic purple suede clogs from a small suitcase.

17:36 Lily Kaise pulls a pair of mystic purple suede clogs onto her feet.

17:36 Lily Kaise puts a small suitcase in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

17:36 Lily Kaise glides out.

17:37 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

17:47 The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight with each other.

17:57 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

17:59 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

17:59 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

18:29 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

18:38 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

18:38 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

18:42 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

18:42 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

18:42 Listen. You need to be careful.

18:45 Remember what I said.

18:45 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

18:46 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

18:52 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

18:52 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

18:53 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

18:56 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

18:56 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:00 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

19:00 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:04 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:04 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

19:06 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:06 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

19:09 Two massive hands reach down and pick up the fishbowl, jostling and sloshing everything inside.

19:09 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

19:09 There's a strong bump from beneath the fishbowl as it is placed in a new location. The hands which were carrying it fade away.

19:09 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

19:09 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:09 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

19:09 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

19:09 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

19:10 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

19:13 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

19:13 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:13 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

19:15 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:16 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

19:19 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

19:19 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:20 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

19:25 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

19:25 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:25 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

19:29 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

19:29 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:29 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

19:33 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.

19:33 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:33 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

19:36 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

19:36 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

19:36 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

19:36 Matteo Hapta's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Repairs?"

19:37 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:37 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah."

19:37 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hurray. Airlock people."

19:37 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Come one come all."

19:40 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Where's everyone."

19:42 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Here."

19:43 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Right here."

19:43 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:44 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

19:44 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:44 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup there's no debris out there so it can be readily assumed... that nobody is out ther!"

19:44 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

19:44 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Let's hope that after cakes worms will not try to take revenge from us."

19:45 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey buddy where'd you buy that Haze!"

19:46 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

19:46 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:46 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

19:49 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

19:49 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:49 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

19:50 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Haze? Where?"

19:52 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

19:52 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

19:53 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

20:05 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

20:06 Lily Kaise removes a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

20:06 Lily Kaise puts on a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

20:06 Lily Kaise glides out.

20:23 The hoverfreeway goes dark. Only reflectors on the surface below act as guides to your driver.

20:30 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

20:30 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

20:30 Lily Kaise puts a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

20:30 Lily Kaise removes a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

20:30 Lily Kaise puts a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

20:30 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

20:33 A giant spider dashes up to the hovertruck bed, coming from behind at terrible speed. It crawls over you quickly and disappears into the distance.

20:42 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

20:44 The hoverfreeway goes dark. Only reflectors on the surface below act as guides to your driver.

20:53 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

20:54 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

20:59 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

21:23 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

21:33 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm alive!"

21:34 Small, bioluminescent alien insects flit above the grass, flashing bright purple hues.

21:41 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Be back."

21:44 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

21:54 The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.

21:57 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

21:57 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

21:57 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

22:02 Lily Kaise removes a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

22:02 Lily Kaise puts on a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

22:05 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

22:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

22:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:27 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

22:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

22:37 A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

22:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

22:47 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

22:52 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

22:57 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

22:57 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

23:27 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

23:37 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

23:48 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

23:57 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

23:58 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
