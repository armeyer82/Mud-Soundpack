-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

06:15:39     * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a pair of violet red leather boots decorated with neon red stars here.
You can go out.
(You are lying on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow 
06:15:39 on it.)

06:15:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And by pointless I just meant that none of the measures we've been taking to stop Outccord appear to be having any effects."

06:15:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd be happy to be wrong about that, though."

06:15:53 I don't see "lily" here.

06:15:55 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

06:15:55 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else.

06:16:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well we shouldn't stop sending our messages forward. It's hard at times to know what they really think but if we simply sit back and say nothing, then that doesn't solve anything. I'm jsut saying that wecan't designate who does what in our government."

06:16:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But yeah, it's starting to look to me like the measures are pointless and we can't stop it."

06:16:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah, you're right about that. That's why we have been sending messages forward."

06:16:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I just don't think they care."

06:16:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi SEAS."

06:16:49 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

06:16:49 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else.

06:17:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule."

06:17:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well yes under less stressful times I felt the same when I was Voice of the Corps but it certainly didn't stop me form keeping the communications channel open."

06:17:33 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

06:17:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It's definitely open."

06:17:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Observation Deck]

06:17:35 You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa with Mischief the sleeping large black felo on it, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing light blue and white aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, and Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

06:17:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wasn't trying to say communicating is pointless."

06:17:52 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]

06:17:52 You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

06:17:52 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

06:17:52 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a small red insulated cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

06:17:52 You can't go that way.

06:17:53 You can't go that way.

06:17:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was saying everything we're doing to stop Outccord appears to be pointless."

06:17:59 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

06:18:03 You glance at your communicator's screen.

06:18:03 233,433.18 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:00  3 September 2317 GST]
You have one mail message.

06:18:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But it hasn't happened yet, so I guess we don't know."
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

You can go south and out.

06:18:16 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident.

06:18:16 Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

06:18:20 Not ejected.

06:18:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

06:18:22 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, a personal hoverpallet, and Shine the big white glowing felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

06:18:22 You exit the ship.

06:18:22 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

06:18:25 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

06:18:25 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

06:18:26 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

06:18:26 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

06:18:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

06:18:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

06:18:28 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:18:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

06:18:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:18:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well we don't really know yet. It's the third day of the month already and we appear to still be affiliated so."

06:18:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:18:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."

06:18:57 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:18:57 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:18:58 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

06:22:02 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

06:22:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

06:25:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:26:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

06:26:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

06:26:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

06:26:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

06:26:19 You pull a large lever towards you.

06:26:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

06:26:21 [The Torus; Garage]

06:26:21 You can go up.

06:26:23 [The Torus; Garage]

06:26:23 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

06:26:36 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Airlock]

06:26:37 You see a glossy blue ceramic felo chow bowl and an obese red soldier felo here.

06:29:51 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

06:29:51 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

06:29:52 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:29:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Israel Hope, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

06:29:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:30:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:30:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:30:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:30:36 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

06:30:39 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:30:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:30:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:30:42 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

06:48:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok please check the Range Office I think the asteroid processor in 285 will go offline in about 2 or 3 hours. I don't know if I will be able to stay awake that long. I did build the station though and it is ready to deploy."

06:54:03 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

06:54:03 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

00:57:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Also."

00:58:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We can't buy chow on New earth from the trading center. I didn't check any other AEU trading centers but I was only able so far to buy it form here on the torus. I don't' know how long we'll have."

00:58:23 You say, "Yeah, I noticed that."

00:58:32 You say, "I tried to go buy felo chow today."

00:58:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So if you ahve a ship with a good-sized hold, you might want to store some. Yes, it's expensive but we may be eventually without any source to obtain felo chow."

00:59:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Did you try here on the torus?"

00:59:20 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:59:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was only able to do so a few hours ago."

00:59:37 You nod.

00:59:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So you tried since you came back?"

00:59:58 You say, "Yeah."

01:00:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Were you able to?"

01:00:17 You say, "Not from New Earth but I was able to from the Torus."

01:00:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Ok so you stored some?"

01:00:35 You nod.

01:01:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok good and we need to keep it pretty well supplied. I'm sure there's others out there who will fetch bags of chow for us but we can't always count on that. The other option of course is to run megapods so it's not that we don't ahve any resources."

01:01:44 You nod.

01:01:59 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
08:28:21 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The

New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a pair of violet red leather boots decorated with neon red stars, Shine the big white glowing felo, Mischief the large black felo, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
13:32:24 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

13:42:06 You grin.

13:42:31 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

13:43:25 Not much to see out there.

13:43:29 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:43:29 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:43:32 You peer out...

13:43:32 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

13:43:36 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:43:39 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

13:43:43 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

13:43:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:43:46 There may be about two seconds of processing lag at the moment.

13:43:46 There is no significant network lag at the moment.

13:43:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:43:54 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:43:54 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:43:55 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

13:43:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:44:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:44:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:44:01 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:44:02 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

13:44:03 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:44:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:44:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:44:06 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

13:44:09 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

13:44:12 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:44:25 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "It's Common But We Don't Talk About It". The organization has earned 2,821,515.79 credits.

13:44:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:44:44 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

13:44:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:44:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:44:58 Lily says to you, "Checkout the warehouse."

13:44:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:45:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

13:45:05 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

13:45:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, OOCly, "Type warehouse form the landing pad."

13:45:13 A rowdy crowd of people rise to their feet as one, pumping their fists in the air and shouting "FUCK TYPE WAREHOUSE" and then favoring each other with high-fives and backslaps.

13:45:14 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:45:14 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:45:19 You say to Lily, "Be right back."

13:45:21 You scramble to your feet.

13:45:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

13:45:22 You exit the ship.

13:45:22 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay One.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glas

You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow 
16:12:52 bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a small red insulated cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

16:13:06 Lily says to you, "So most of the Modules we have for guture will be kept in the Warehouse."

16:13:08 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Beacons."

16:13:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Future."

16:13:15 You say, "Makes sense."

16:14:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am waiting for pierre to get some more Passive Beacons and once he has then if he has put them aboatd Building Capital, I'll go offload all of them plus what's still there. I may get rid of the regular Module Transporters in the future except the scouts but I'll wait until we see what Accord does in terms of the ships we can still obtain."

16:16:20 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

16:16:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the five-person strike gunboat "Kartal". The organization has earned 758,502.42 credits.

16:16:51 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Baconers. Callin all baconers."

16:20:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

16:20:19 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

16:20:20 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

16:20:34 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

16:20:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

16:20:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

16:20:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

16:20:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

16:20:43 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:20:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:20:58 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

16:20:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:21:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:21:14 The computer announces, "Automatic post-launch wormhole jump aborted."

16:21:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hmm."

16:21:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

16:21:33 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:21:34 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

16:21:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:21:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:21:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:21:40 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:21:41 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

16:21:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:21:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:21:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:21:45 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:21:48 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

16:21:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

16:21:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

16:21:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:21:59 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 106" has jumped out of the sector.

16:22:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:22:16 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

16:22:21 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts close to a large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior, and the creatures appear to merge for a few moments.

16:22:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:22:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Woo."

16:22:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:22:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

16:22:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:22:39 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:22:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow interesting combo there."

16:22:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

16:22:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

16:22:51 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

16:23:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Any word on that constantine?"

16:23:40 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

16:34:50 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

16:34:52 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

16:35:15 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the five-person strike gunboat "Kartal". The organization has earned 740,203.29 credits.

16:35:28 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

16:35:28 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa is standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

16:35:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:35:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:35:54 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:35:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:35:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:36:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:36:29 Which sector did you mean?

16:36:29 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

16:36:30 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:36:31 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

16:36:32 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 13,468,750.00 credits from a xenology submission.

16:36:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:36:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:36:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:36:37 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:36:38 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

16:36:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:36:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:36:43 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:36:45 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

16:36:50 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:37:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:37:09 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

16:37:12 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 106" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

16:37:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

16:37:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:37:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:37:30 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:37:54 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:37:54 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:02:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You still wanna do that power."

17:02:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm... sorry, that makes no sense. Trying to do too many things at once."

17:03:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

17:04:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

17:04:47 Lily says to you, "Ok so I took your Acting founder Status off while you're not available very much but I will restore it. I needed to get the Warehouse started up and I didn't have time to wait for you or Constantine."

17:05:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "So nothing personal!"

17:09:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You mean blow it up?"

17:09:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "Yeah."

17:10:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think that will help?"

17:10:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I honestly don't know. I know it would help to shatter this illusion tha the corps is divided. I can try the other thing we talked about first though, if you'd rather."

17:11:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er. The illusion that the corps is divided."

17:17:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We'll try th other thing first, I suppose."

17:17:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What was the other thing - the permit?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."

17:17:57 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Fringe 5."

17:18:02 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Right. Bring that."

17:18:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That goes for the other fols listening as well, since we're talking about it on comms anyways."

17:18:10 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Confirmed."

17:18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. folks, not folls that would be silly."

17:18:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah sorry about the lack of secrecy. I figure they'll probably just continue to do nothing."

17:19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh oh, are we finally blowing up hardened asteroid haulers?"

17:20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Personally, I would like to do my Pulsar, in support of constantine doing his bribe fighter."

17:20:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or,  at the very least, my regular fighter."

17:20:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That goes back to the issue of blowing up warships, which I strongly advise against. We want to be ready to fight enemy threats."

17:21:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I personally think blowing ships up will send the wrong message."

17:21:44 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I just jumped to earth as if it's a nest..."

17:21:53 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega chuckles.

17:22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like if I blow it up, there's really no reason to blow other stuff up."

17:22:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I would be blowing the ship up for a specific reason."

17:22:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well currently the message is that the corps is divided on Outccord."

17:22:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The reason being how I got it."

17:22:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That could very well be true constantine."

17:22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But I wasn't about to suggest it and not offer of doing something similar."

17:24:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Also, as much as I want to believe this would be viewed positively in the news, I'm just not sure it will be."

17:24:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh it wont be."

17:24:22 A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

17:24:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They never just post news headlines as they are. Got to twist them."

17:25:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I even doubt the ISN would report my actions in a positive light."

17:26:22 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

17:27:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Im not blowing up warships that just sends a very wrong message."

17:27:52 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

17:30:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If anyone blows up warships, they better kiss any opportunity to ever obtain a specialty warship goodbye."

17:30:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Destroyers?"

17:31:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Great ships, destroyers."

17:31:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What about them?"

17:32:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Was considering doing that."

17:32:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Blowing up a destroyer?"

17:34:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah."

17:34:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Why?"

17:36:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:36:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "All I can say Constantine is that blowing up combat ships sends a very very wrong message. Also if you ever want to be considered for a Flare or a Pincer, you may do yourself some damage there in terms of how you'dbe viewed in terms of how you would take care of a highly subsidized privilege."

17:36:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sugar coated answer or how I really feel?"

17:37:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I expect I'd never get an application ship if I did that."

17:37:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:37:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Probably not."

17:37:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't really think it's a good idea."

17:37:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "That's how I think, Lily."

17:37:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Why sugar coat it?"

17:37:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'll let you pick."

17:37:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oops, sorry."

17:37:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Destruction of ships just isnt the way to go in my opinon."

17:37:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "There's really no reason to sugar coat things."

17:37:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:37:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It isn't because they are manufactured in limited quantities so ifw e were to be besieged nd lose ships then there may not be replacements available as well."

17:38:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, there's no replacing the prototype, anyway. I would only have destroyed it to protest the reason that they gave it to me, but as I said, I don't think they'll care."

17:38:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I don't think it would bring us any positive attention in the news."

17:39:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:39:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well think about consequences. A prototype is just that though and they won't like it. Trust me."

17:39:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What are the thoughts on inviting other alliances pilots to come to the protest, which will hopefully be starting tomorrow around 20:00."

17:39:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I know they won't like it, that's what I've been saying."

17:39:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Because Best is a dumbass who twisted things to make it seem like I was on his side and frankly I'd like to send a message that nothing would please me more than his sorry ass spending his remaining years in the same manner as Sheffield in a cell."

17:39:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I just mean they won't care about my protest."

17:39:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:39:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well they won't and the harm will be felt by you."

17:39:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:39:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oops mis-comm."

17:40:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I get that, but how does blowing your ship up send that message?"

17:40:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like if you wanted to send that message, you could just say that right into general over comms or something."

17:40:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:40:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As for a protest I will try to be available. It would be interesting to see if other alliances really are interested though."

17:40:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well I suppose he did just get the message."

17:41:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Why bother? To me the other alliance pilots have made it very clear they in the end, don't really give a shit what we do, they expect results from us yet really haven't done anything on their end. Why would they help now?"

17:41:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:41:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well Tara the converse is to find out if they really do."

17:41:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I definitely get the frustration. I feel like we've been working hard for a way out of this, and we just aren't finding one."

17:41:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "All they have done is talk shit. That's what i've seen."

17:41:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know it's wearing on me."

17:41:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know it's wearing on you, Vernos."

17:42:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:42:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They will always talk shit. That's their gang mentality for ya."

17:42:22 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender.

17:42:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess my main concern is that blowing the fighter up will only hurt me and not add anything to the cause."

17:42:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe that's selfish."

17:42:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think there's any reason to blow up your ships though, Vernos."

17:42:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it would show that they do give a shit if they show up. We are fighting against isolationism, so I feel like attempting to include them shows that a bit more than not including them. That's my take on it anyways."

17:43:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Its not selfish to be thinking of your future, Constantine."

17:43:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "You never really planned or expected any of this to happen, yeah?"

17:43:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:43:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No it's not It's being responsible and keeping yourself viable as a pilot Constantine."

17:43:41 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Anyone up for a nest after that?"

17:43:46 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah."

17:43:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I definitely didn't."

17:44:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:44:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You know Constantine you could always tell them to take the Prototype back that it doesn't represent your true sentaments. That is better than destroying a prototype."

17:45:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I could that, I didn't think of it because I don't know how I would."

17:45:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I'll ask them to take it back through the terminal."

17:45:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, at the very least you should perhaps sell it and make a declaration that you will not be used as a pawn. Something like that anyways. Currently it appears to the citizens and to the rest of the alliances,  that the corps is divided between patriots and dissidents."

17:45:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I would have painted 'Fuck best' on the prototype then told them to take it back, if I had been in your shoes, Constantine. I woulda been soooo pissed."

17:45:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When the truth is, none of us are for Outccord or Best, unless I'm just wrong about that."

17:45:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:45:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Send a letter to the Liaison or to whomever else you think you can communicate and yeah I agree with tara hehe. Still, I wouldn't blow it up."

17:46:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I should have just not picked it up at all. I only did because I was mad about it and had sinister plans for it."

17:46:22 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

17:46:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "None of which were things that would have been good ideas."

17:46:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:46:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

17:46:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "They kind of fired our Liaison didn't they?"

17:47:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They did fire him, but they're going to replace him, if they haven't already."

17:47:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And there are still other people in the office."

17:47:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You folks who have been labled as supportes, have had that done to you against your will. I understand that being a patriot is not inherently bad, but in this instance it's being used to create an illusion of support for Best. Now I don't know what you guys can do about that but it's nto right that you're beign used in this way."

17:48:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, yeah, I'll try to return it to them, and if they won't take it back, I'll sell it or something."

17:48:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:48:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh yeah well we all are entitled to our thoughts. It's what you do with them. This is what we attempted in vain to communicate with that twit Tatiana who said she wanted to launch beacons in Mutuality space to destroy humanity and then she says it was just a thought. Well a thought which one should never communicate to others."

17:48:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

17:48:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "If anything, sell it to the accord!"

17:49:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That would probably put me in Dure."

17:49:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:49:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sometimes those are just our way of venting where you cannot. It's how one acts and there re things best unsaid."

17:49:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I imagine."

17:49:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's just a shame, really. The folks who are not striking are all newer pilots and doing so for their own reasons. But it's being portrayed like you folks support Accord."

17:49:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, the Accord are god guys, they likely would just not take it if it would cause a problem."

17:49:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. good guys."

17:49:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would hope not, but I'm leery of even trying to sell it to them."

17:49:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I'll rename my ships to 'screw outcord' and 'Best is stupid'. Does that help?"

17:50:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores snickers.

17:50:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:50:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah that would be selling our tech to another alliance which is uh probably a huge offense. Just give it back Constantine. Honestly do that and let them know it's not for you."

17:50:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though I still think that we could have those ships and stay in the Accord, just dedicate a small percentage of the ships built to the Accord. That should take some of the strain off of funding."

17:51:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Of course, funding is clearly not what they really want to leave the Accord for."

17:51:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think you do have a point, Eli. However, just going from what I've seen, I'm not sure we can convince the other alliances that we're all united."

17:51:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's not that's just one of their excuses."

17:51:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Either because they don't want to believe it, or just because it's too late now."

17:51:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "But no, theres not really much we can do about being labeled as patriots besides just being vocal about our stance on it all."

17:52:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's not them I want to convince. It's the citizens on the ground, the members of government that don't know the whoel story."

17:52:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I do wish we could get through to the citizens."

17:52:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Unfortunately we've seen the tight grip they keep on the news in home space."

17:52:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I have to believe any information about us being united just won't be passed on."

17:52:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "Perhaps the protest will help with that then."

17:52:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I hope so."

17:53:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Constantine, they never believed we were united on this in the first place. They don't want to be convinced, they just want something to point fingers at, blame, and laugh at while they watch from the sidelines. That's the impression i've gotten from the other alliance corps. I'm hoping Eli's protest proves me wrong."

17:53:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "As long as we get enough citizens out there, they'll likely get some news shots of it. It's gonna have to be noticeable."

17:54:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:54:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well it's not going to prove anything to just do nothing. We have to keep at it for however long it will take. Yes it is exhausting in many respects but we must exemplify that we shalll not be beaten down."

17:54:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That is true for some Tara, but not all the other alliances pilots are like that. There's actually been some decent support coming out of both, It's just not very public."

17:54:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean you are certainly right, there's been some douchy behavior, for sure. But not everyone in those alliances feels the same way."

17:55:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Um.. who just blew up over New Earth?"

17:55:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:55:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That is true. Remember big mouths don't necessarily represent the majority."

17:55:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I blew up a fighter, eli."

17:55:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Sorry, but when experienced and much more veteran pilots gang up on and bully newer pilots like my self and dakhal over the strike and the like, it has nothing to do with the current situation."

17:55:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "They just want to be better then someone else."

17:56:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:56:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh well their mentality is to try to discourage newer pilots. I do believe it's unnerving to other alliances that AEU is groing strong again as well."

17:57:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "They just made me more determined to work, honestly."

17:58:06 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Fuller 'n A Tick". The organization has earned 1,613,793.19 credits.

17:58:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh well that's not supporting our cause but yeah. I can't tell a new pilot to not work."

17:58:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "Yeah, and our performance was actually up from last time."

17:58:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's the other thing."

17:58:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "People who throw their longetivity as a pilot around expecting respect from me won't get anything."

17:58:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:58:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not on my account heh."

17:58:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm worried we have basically no bargaining power."

17:58:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And maybe we never did."

17:59:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "You mean with the Mutuality, Constantine?"

17:59:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "As a corps?"

17:59:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I mean as a corps."

17:59:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We definitely have none with the Mutuality."

17:59:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I don't know, some of the stuff that's been done has been noticed."

17:59:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He means that with half of us working and half us not, we're not making a big enough impact to make a difference. That's kinda what blowing up some ships was about too."

17:59:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:59:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I don't exactly agree as we have already been effective. Sometimes can only accomplish a little at a time."

18:00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Have we been effective?"

18:00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I'm not trying to push anyone either way, I know it makes sense for some people to work."

18:01:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:01:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes we've affected Merchant trading and well sometimes it takes awhile. Nothing can happen overnight with issues this entrenched."

18:01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am still willing to give money to anyone who wishes to take part in the strike but who doesn't currently have the credits to support themselves! I am glorious philanthropist."

18:01:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I hope that's having an effect."

18:01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know about Tara, but for me the thing I miss the most is points."

18:01:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The money doesn't really matter one lick to me."

18:01:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bah, points."

18:01:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:01:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know I've certainly run Merchants out of our space."

18:01:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bah, I say."

18:01:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I said to Eli, I can pay my phone bill for like 150 more months."

18:02:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "My investments would support me just fine, its not about making money for me."

18:02:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Anyone but me Ather? I actually meet both of those."

18:02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Its about experience."

18:02:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh yeah, you can't have anything."

18:02:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:02:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, I am conflicted about asking our new pilots to stop working. That is too dictatorial. One can only hope that they will decide for themselves."

18:02:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can get experience without working, depending on what kinda experience you're aiming for."

18:03:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey laughs at Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

18:03:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:03:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That is very true Ather."

18:03:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Fair enough."

18:03:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm not telling them to not work. I'm simply informing them, that if they are willing to go along with the strike, I would be happy to fund anything that they might need for as long as it's ongoing."

18:03:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:03:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I would support that as well."

18:04:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh for sure, I'm not about pressuring hte newer folks to strike. They're all practically fresh out of pilot school into this mess."

18:04:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "As for the Mutuality..."

18:06:22 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

18:06:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Honestly they enjoy toying with us at this point. While it would be prudent once shit calms down to try to get assurances from the government that the AEU navy will not launch attacks into Mutuality space, in exchange for the QSA stuff and shared tech access or what have you, I'm still not really interested in bending over backwards for a non-aggression pact by trying to waste time figuring out what the fuck else they could possibly want. I mean, our shit is more valuable than theirs. We have a non-aggression pact, it means they'll be able to buy the revo, and the telex jackrabbit grid. What will we get? Shit. In the form of Mutuality battlesuits. That's about the only worthwhile thing they have for us."

18:07:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. All the farport stuff."

18:07:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wouldn't that fall under the QSA agreement, like it has for the last several years?"

18:07:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The farport stuff doesn't require a nonagression pact."

18:07:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

18:08:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:08:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well it sure would be great to be able to obtain their Exploration upgrades. I guess we can live without them but here too since the aEU Government doesn't care for us being Explorers, they certainly won't support us there."

18:08:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well yes, if the old agreement had been renewed, but we're having to make a whole new agreement I think."

18:08:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The mutuality didn't break off relations recently, they broke off relations since the slave trade, remember. We were still able to buy all thee farport stuff."

18:08:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, you are probably right."

18:08:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And that's the key here. -we- didn't break off relations, -they- broke off relations."

18:08:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would like to at a minimum see the QSA access restored, but I agree that it won't happen any time soon."

18:09:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:09:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes that's how I've gelt too but still, our Government did nothing by not showing up when we are clearly under the Mutuality's thumb or such as it is."

18:09:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:09:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Felt that is."

18:09:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We were set up."

18:09:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You said yourself all they want is assurances that the AEU won't launch attacks into their space. We get those assurance publically made by the government, that'll give them what they want."

18:09:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:09:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We've always been set up every time since over the three and a half years I've been a pilot."

18:09:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They didn't send anyone, because they knew that we would, and then they could blame all the tensions btween the Union and the Mutuality on us and lambeth."

18:10:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:10:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

18:12:09 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "The Huggy Pug". The organization has earned 1,701,697.60 credits.

18:12:23 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

18:12:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what makes me the most angry about all of this. Everyone is getting treated like pawns in Best's game. At no point have they even tried to address the concerns we've expressed, or tried to deal with anything. I mean, don't even folks who support Best want the strike to end? And yet there's been no attempt made at all to try to talk to us or anything. Instead they just move everyone around like game pieces."

18:13:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I can understand why they're not backing down."

18:13:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Also, from their perspective, it doesn't matter what we say, work still gets done."

18:13:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's not about backign down, they haven't even tried to engage the corps through the terminal. They're just pretendin glike it's not happening."

18:13:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The simple fact of the matter is, pilots have always been quicker to cave than the government. They're waiting for it to happen again. In a sense, it already has a few times before people have reaffirmed one thing or another about the strike."

18:13:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:13:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "True as we won't back down nor will they so we have to continue our rpessure."

18:14:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Wait, tensions, Us?"

18:14:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores coughs.

18:14:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Flottilla? Hello?"

18:14:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores coughs.

18:14:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, it's very obvious where the tensions came from. But the Patriots are painting their own picture to the citizens of the Union."

18:15:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They specifically are using lambeth as a scapegoat."

18:15:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "And to put someone more favoring them in postion."

18:15:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Take for example, temporary stations. I'll be honest, I didn't even think that they would contribute stuff to the alliance, though logic should've dicated that they would've. Technically, as long as we're participating in the temporary stations that gain shit for AEU-based organizations, the alliance is gaining resources from them, because they get a cut of those resources. Kim was right to stop giving parts for those. It's why I said that invaders parts are to not be used until further notice."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah they can all decide to renounce their titles individually if they are truly with us. Otherwise, they are certainly free to carry on as Patriots if this what they individually or collectively believe in."

18:15:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, exactly."

18:16:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Patriot to me means I support the AEU and its people. Not the government, Lily."

18:17:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But for what kinds of stations? Asteroid processors? Salvage processors? Or just the beacon stations?"

18:17:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:17:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And she used some of our Megacredits to purchase them."

18:17:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Is that really why you think they gave you that tag though Tara? I understand your point on that completely, but that's certainly not the message that's getting sent."

18:17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I have industrial parts in invaders warehouse. It doesn't mean that I'm using them."

18:18:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well Kim purchased them the very next afternoon when Evangeline said otherwise."

18:18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Kim has basically been gone for the past month."

18:18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't think she had an active role in any of this."

18:18:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She popped in very briefly,  but didn't nkow much about what was going on."

18:19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "How'd she top the conquest results then?"

18:19:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If she is "striking," it's by virtue of not wanting to do anything to begin with."

18:19:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably belt managementtran 1 She popped in very briefly,  but didn't nkow much about what was going on."

18:19:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, she probably collected belt points."

18:19:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. probably belt management."

18:19:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's the other thing about pilot strikes, how do they even know we're just not working for unrelated reasons?"

18:19:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "There are tons of pilots on the payroll who never come on comms."

18:20:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:20:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I can show our financial log or you can go look that up Constantine. I was rather shocked when after Melinda posted to general that Kim went right out and purchased 2 solar panels and I think it was three Fission Breeder Reactors with our megacredits included."

18:20:25 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

18:20:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like the government might well just be saying Huh, looks like Constantine is taking an extended break."

18:20:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "As he has done in the past."

18:20:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And as Akira has done for months and months."

18:20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "As have many others."

18:21:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I'm sure they are aware of you being part of the merchants thing constantine."

18:21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But I do see your point."

18:21:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:21:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That was rather sneaky if she truly didn't want their parts going onto income-yielding stations."

18:21:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I doubt she meant to be sneaky, but of course I'm not in her head. She probably just didn't know what was happening."

18:21:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Kinda like how I was happy Tara was not around when the strike started, because that at least meant she was not working, though it did not mean she had joined the strike officially."

18:22:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:22:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well she doesn't deserve anyone's excuses. Trust me she is not a very honest individual. I have personal eperience."

18:22:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:22:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Experience."

18:22:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "I won't be able to avoid it no matter what I do, Eli."

18:23:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:23:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So does Shule which is one reason why he left Starseekers. I formed this organizaiton prior to then and I never asked him to leave Starseekers."

18:23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Avoid what?"

18:23:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I just meant when you were on tha texpidition, at least you weren't here contributing at the beginning of the strike."

18:23:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that surprises me. Kim has always been pretty nice to me. If you don't mind, I might ask to hear about it sometime."

18:23:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So it helped a little, without you havign to directly join."

18:23:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:23:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh heh that is her tactic."

18:24:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "This whole issue, if I do nothing, I'm basically making an idiot of myself with the goals I set as being a pilot, and I always finish what I start, if I do stuff as a pilot, it makes it seem like I support the government."

18:24:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "So its a lose lose for me."

18:24:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "She wanted me in seekers, too, but I thought I would like the atmosphere here more."

18:24:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I can certainly understand that. Though the idea is not to keep this up forever heh."

18:24:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I do."

18:25:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And seekers has basically collapsed, so I chose correctly."

18:25:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

18:25:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I actually sympathize with you more than you know, Tara."

18:25:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ideally it'll end sooner than later."

18:25:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "I wanted to be an explorer, more then anything. You can't believe how dissapointed I was when I learned the AEU isnt putting much stock in exploration. Its really disheartening."

18:25:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores sighs.

18:26:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:26:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Haha well You tte me as I am and I am not a bullshitter. It may shock some but I will never be more than honest and open and independent."

18:26:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know what you mean. I think we can still take the reins back."

18:26:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "When this mess is over we'll have a meeting about it."

18:26:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:26:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We can and we shall!"

18:26:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Once this stuff is settled, I'm goign to start running expidtions. If we can show that it's beneficial to explore, we'll tart getting more development for stuff like that."

18:27:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though.. my first expidition will likely be very interesting. without Farport upgrades it's gonna be kind of bare bones, but so be it."

18:27:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

18:27:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "Consider it a test."

18:28:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:28:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thatwe shall and even if my brain doesn't heal up from the head injury from when I lost the little bit of Starcharting skill I had, that hasn't stopped me from exploring. I just haven't had a lot of time lately to lead others."

18:32:57 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Rest Station from the two-person light transport "Rhino". The organization has earned 305,222.65 credits.

18:32:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "It shows ones skill if you can make do without advantages others have that you don't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There are still exploration options available to us. There always were. Yes, it's true, that people couldn't explore at this current time in anything better than a tactical platform, unless they do what Jonathan Gray did, and piggyback on friends from other alliances. However, a tactical platform can still go a considerable distance. Back when Annie was around, we took a tactical platform all the way to the folks at Gunarsh, who were as yet previously undiscovered. Now there are shuttles that we can attach that can take them even farther out. I will only grant that at the moment, new tactical platforms cannot be bought and/or outfitted. However, it's not like there are none unavailable to AEU pilots at the moment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ouch Lily, I hadn't hueard about that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The simple fact of the matter however, is people chose not to use these avenues of exploration. So, that's why exploration budgets were cut back so much."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tra
18:32:57 nsmits, "Oh it sure can."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "I've been looking at the tactical platform as an option, Ather."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey you guys, once we've gotten to some point with the Accord issue at least, we will be doing an artifacting trip. Unfortunately, we can't take many so we will have to limit who we can invite other than ourselves."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "Alright! Cool!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily also makes a huge mistake in believing that starcharts are critical to expeditions; they're not. You can navigate almost as effectively with the NDB. Starcharts are mostly useful for getting from point A to point B. When you're out just exploring, there's no real practical use in a chart."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So please keep it under wrtps."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We could fit 1 module scout and 4 scouts in a carrier, right?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "More ships if we bring shuttles. I hope to ha
18:32:57 ve access to the worse shuttle soon."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No no I'm not saying taht Ather but I'd have felt a little more assurance on my own with others less experienced."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, Ather, that's how we navigated on the expedition I went on recently."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So do we know that even Helios rentals are off limits?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That has not yet been confirmed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "One of our cadets had a rental suit, so I thought we could still get some things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I do really want a platform. I was hoping I could at least still get that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I probably could get us within range of Feng Wo but with those crazy sRiftstorms out there, it's challenging and we did actually get off course and it did require some charting to get us in range of Feng Wo this last time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, Agnar is...not relaly a part of the Mutuality. He rents to pretty much anyone. Heck, he rents to Mr. Kelsey. Rented to him even before the Mutuality and the tandem pact decided to be stupid and include him in their circle."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe it's worth a shot, then."

18:33:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll see if Eve can run me out there sometime."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

22:41:51     * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Beta.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver cer
22:41:51 amic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a small red insulated cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
