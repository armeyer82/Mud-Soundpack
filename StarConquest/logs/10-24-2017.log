18:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I actually don't like pot shots. One, it uses grid on our ships unnecessarily and two, it can throw off timing for the ship we are targeting."

18:07 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

18:07 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

18:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "More is the case, of, I get a lock on.. then the tracker picks it up, right as I fire the lasers. So, the timing is almost perfect. And not really pot shots."

18:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, if it's not the ship we're attacking, it doesn't allow the grid to recharge. Sometimes, I actually brak contact on purpose to help the grid."

18:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Break."

18:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah, I figured that. I never fire the lasers unless I can have a confirmed lock. Otherwise it uses up the grid."

18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Nothing more than annoying than you have a lock, then the lasers are about to fire, the lock is lost and the grid takes a hit."

18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The targeting computer helps insure that the grid isn't used up by a shot into empty space, but if I'm not tracking, it's usually a good opportunity to let the grid charge."

18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "That's true. But, it seems that losing a lock, loses the grid used by the lasers."

18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Not often the case.. but, it happens. A couple times in that fight."

18:14 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "And those lost locks were when the ship was being tracked."

18:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "My point is, if I'm not tracking, try not to shoot. Even if you hit a ship and it's the wrong ship, it still uses grid unnecessarily. If you hit that ship and you don't hit it again for a few minutes, it doesn't really matter that you hit it as you just gave it time to repair anyways."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys still beaconing?"

20:08 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:08 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ok I think I like the fringe suit better, at least for low deployment missions. I just killed my first drone when I had no such luck with the one for AEU."

22:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't suppose I could rope any of you into doing a nest?"

22:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I can come after finishing this mission."

22:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool."

22:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Same here Jade. The Fringe suit has much more of a punch."

22:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sure. I could do a nest."

22:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"

22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Is it a tier 5 nest?"

22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The suits will be bottom-tier."

22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But the action will be nothing but top-tier."

22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I'm definitely not tier 5, only 1."

22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That is lame."

22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin laughs.

22:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh neat, I got an energy bottle from one of these drones."

22:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just<n, can -ou ]o a ne>t?"

22:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Gotta bug out shortly, next time."

22:30 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "One for a nest?"

22:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "If you guys get enough people before I'm done, go ahead. I'm not sure how long this will take. There's a lot of rooms here."

22:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like we won't get anyone."

22:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Take your time, at any rate."

22:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "This little pistol isn't half bad."

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How big is the hold of the heavy transport?"

22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "So are we nesting? Or have we not found enough people still."

22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We never got enough."

22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah ok."

22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I'll just keep practicing then."

22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What kind of suit do you have?"

22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Fringe now."

22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I was on AEU, but I had to refurbish the last time I went in a low deployment."

22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting. What do you do about damage in the fringe suit? Are the repair drones you find enough to keep it going?"

22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I find those, plus I think the suit itself has a bit of regen on it. It repairs itself slowly over time."

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, suits do fix themselves over time."

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It can just take a while."

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Well, so far the pistol has done way better than that laser on the AEU suits."

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Agreed. I'm cleaning up down here."

22:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, fringe suits are much better for doing damage."

22:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Going on my second mission, it's quite profitable."

22:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I never tried a low deployment in anything but an AEU suit, though. It's good to know you don't really need to repair."

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "How did you survive that? Did you just run to the tower and hope you didn't get blown up before destroying it?"

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, just regen myself, shoot at a thing till it dies, repair myself up, repeat."

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "That probably took ages."

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Am I correct in assuming that for the low mission the primary goal is to destroy the drone control tower?"

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "That's what happened when I did the last one."

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think they took any longer than doing SVP pods, but it's been quite a while."

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah the goal is to destroy the tower."

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Never done those."

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if you're doing low deployments without repairing I assume you can probably do SVP pods without it, too."

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I like killing the drones and finding the stuff for my suit though. It's nice."

22:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe the armor makes a huge different and you just don't take much damage."

22:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "That could be it. I didn't get light armor when I used it."

22:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "But I did for this one."

22:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I never used armor on my AEU suit either."

22:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would typically end a fight around 40% damaged."

23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And have to repair three times."

23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The rental is probably a good balance, too."

23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you can get someone to fly you out to Helios."

23:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You know when you're doing a tesla site, the leader will try to use his laser or whatever."

23:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And people will try to stun."

23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, eventually you will."

23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "And you can use your normal battle suit for that?"

23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you just need to pony up a fee."

23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it's 20 million."

23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And there's some special equipment you can use."

23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah. Huge fee."

23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Hopefully you make lots of money there."

23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like it, but it's not too bad."

23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's decent."

23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The jobs pay in their own tesla bucks."

23:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But you can convert them."

23:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And choose to favor either points, credits, or a balance of both."

23:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh interesting."

23:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I always take points and 1000 tesla bucks gets me 40 industry, 3 ground, and 25 million credits."
