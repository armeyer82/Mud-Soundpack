Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

alliances.  HELP ALLIANCE GOVERNMENTS has been removed, and in its place are
HELP LEAGUE GOVERNMENT, HELP AEU GOVERNMENT, HELP FRINGE GOVERNMENT, HELP EAOS

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

with the liason officer he gave me a few rather simple tasks to complete in
exchange for enough credits to pay off my first ship, and not much else. Once
that is through you have a few other options."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "You may have already
received a letter from the Space Vermin Patrol Command - if not, then you'll be
receiving one in the next day or so. They have a beacon you may jump to, and the
commander of the station there has a number of missions you can fulfill on their
behalf. Outside of that, you can salvage debris and sell it at planets or
stations in exchange for credits, or jump to the Glittering Belt and oversee a
mining site if you have a little more time on your hands."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Hello. Is
anyone interested in doing a space vermine patrol with me? I am still trying to
get a hang of gunning, but I cannot concentrate on that when I am flying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah in a hesitant voice, "as I am still
getting a hang of flying itself. You know?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Elijah,
sorry, I was dozing earlier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Those missions
aren't the greatest for doing with a partner."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If it will help
you I'll come fly for you sometime and get you some practice shooting rats or
something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Quite alright.
I'm in the middle of the sector now. Effecting repairs, but I am almost at about
45 percent on turrets 3 and 2."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah okay. Well,
there's no shame in taking a quick jaunt home if your guns get shot out. You're
free to leave and return to the sector in those missions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Yeah. I'm too
far from them right now, so I'm not being fired on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Never mind."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I only have one
turret left. Oh well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't forget
your torpedo launcher."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In fact, when
you're starting out a single torpedo is often enough to dispose of a rat when
your guns would take several shots."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm saying these
things assuming that you're in a fighter and not a cargo hauler or something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "In a fighter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Got them all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "My goodness!

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, have you
talked to that guy on the Space Vermin Patrol Command landing pad?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "All it cost me
was four laser turrets and some hull damage. But I am dealing with that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "He will set up
your ship to pull cores off the rats."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Yeah. I got
some cores I think. Let me start heading back towards spinward and I can check
the cargo bay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool, those are
pretty handy. Cash and industry points, I believe. If you ever turn in a bunch
and he won't take any more, just hang onto them and try again the next day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "And I can get
my ship repaired while I am there. A win win, I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Oh. I only got
two rats cores even though I blew up three ships. Hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I sware, is the
fellow on AEU channel ten ever satisfied?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "He almost was, once."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You won't get an
intact core from every ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Well,
I'll turn in these two and see about going out again. I think I have a strategy,
but let's see if it works. I still have a bit of trouble avoiding getting hit
while gunning, but if I can blow them up fast enough, then that should work, I
think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you can't
dodge rats drills."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't feel like
you're doing a bad job of dodging."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Alright.
Then I'll just take it like a starship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The only you can
really do it limit your exposure to multiple rats."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's good to
move a bit while shooting if you can so that you don't have dozens of them in
range of you at once, drilling pieces of ship off."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Do those drills
go farther than our weapons? Only sometimes, I feel like I get hit, and I still
can't track them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, they should
need to be right next to you to hit you with the drills."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure why
you would be having trouble tracking them -- are you certain you weren't already
tracking something else?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Then maybe
they move right after I target, or I track when I am moving. Still learning
this."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Well, I am now
500,000 EOS credits richer. What do you suppose that guy wants with all those
cores? I can't remember if he told me or not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I don't
remember. Probably just research of some kind."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or maybe he's a
black market reseller."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "He looks a bit
like one, in his trenchcoat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Constantine?
Was that you who had the ship capable of transporting a battle suit?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do have one,
yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, how did that
nest go the other day?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. I was
wondering, so I did a nest two days ago, and they dropped me on Chetumal, so my
battlesuit is over there. Might you or someone with a fortress help me bring it
back to New Earth?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh sure, no
problem."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Want to move it
now?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "If you are
available, sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure, I'll meet
you there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Meet me where?
New earth, or Chetumal?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Chetumal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Alright."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In your fighter,
then I can move the ship and suit at the same time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Perfect."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily, have we
set up an asteroid processor yet?"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like

Star Conquest Help: RATS

REPLICATING AUTONOMOUS TRANSMIGRATORY SPACECRAFT
For many years, rumours of the infamous 'replicators' filtered only through the
outskirts of the thinly spread unreg community.  Anyone who heard the story
would merely smile and nod, while anyone who claimed to have seen a berserker
drone was assumed to have Space Madness and could be safely ignored.
This is no longer the case. 
The von Neumann machines now known as 'RATS' are devices that have one purpose:
to make more of themselves.  Whatever original mission they may once have had
has long since been forgotten, this is now their primary (and only apparent)
objective.  Their origin is likewise unknown, but evidence indicates that they
have emerged from somewhere significantly Rimward of the vague, constantly
shifting borders of unregistered space.  
Each class of RATS appears to have a different task designed to make this
primary purpose more efficient: probes to scout an area to detect the largest
concentrations of raw materials; miners to facilitate speedier acquisition of
those raw materials; reapers to acquire raw material from threats.  There are
also rumors of other classes, from great hulks to tiny things the size of a
person.
When a region is fully harvested of usable materials probes are sent out en
masse to locate new resources, and when a suitable one is detected the process
begins once again.
In the event that probes do not find enough raw materials within some set amount
of time, it has been recorded that larger classes of RATS will be cannibalised
in order to reuse their own base materials to construct whatever classes of RATS
are necessary for the most efficient propagation of the swarm.
It is theorised that the vast hulks we have termed 'assimilators' may be a stage
in nest formation, as they are extremely rare and have currently only been seen
briefly in regions that soon develop a high swarm presence.
Information gained from damaged cores have shown that the RATS possess a complex
learning algorithm that utilises emergent behaviour to find the most efficient
solution to a task.  Despite many claims to the contrary, they are in no way
sentient or self-aware, but are instead idiot savants of the highest order that
can reach the optimal solution to a problem in a frighteningly short space of
time, resulting in new designs of RATS that are able to avoid previous problems.
While singularly they are barely a minor nuisance - a few probes easily
dispatched by even the most novice of pilots - the RATS travel in swarms of
millions and a single probe seen means that hundreds of thousands of miners,
reapers and more are close by, unseen.  Encountering even a fraction of an
active swarm is something to be avoided if at all possible.
KNOWN SWARMS:
ALPHA-15-02-05-MD - The first 'major' swarm detected, original EAOS scans
indicated over one and a half billion individual RATS units, but in 2317 the
swarm broke the two billion mark.  It is currently moving coreward parallel to
interalliance space on a course which does not intersect with any beaconed
sector.
BETA-16-09-10-TA - The second 'major' swarm detected, original EAOS scans
indicated approximately one and a half billion individual RATS units. Currently
being tracked as it moves on a circular path through an oort cloud with a
potential risk of course corrections leading towards Mutuality space.  Due to
several careful 'pruning' efforts over the past few years from Tandem Pact
patrols, EAOS task forces, and Accord Peacekeepers, current scans report barely
one billion individual units.
GAMMA-12-05-17-SC - The third 'major' swarm detected, comprised of approximately
three billion individual units. It is currently heading away from inhabited
space towards the Kiron Nebula, located antispinward and 'down' of inhabited
space.
There are at least a dozen 'minor' swarms monitored by the Tandem Pact, EAOS,
and Accord of Free Worlds.  Minor swarms comprise of less than one billion
individual RATS units, with varied courses.  Several minor swarms have been
eradicated by a combined effort of careful 'pruning' while others have been
cannibalised by larger swarms as they intersect.  Smaller swarms often merge to
form larger swarms, which may lead to the creation of further major swarms.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Hello friends,
If you are receiving this letter, you have been selected by Melinda, Pierre, and
Damien to come on the first contact mission that the EAOS has spoke of in the
headlines. This date is not set in stone, but the tentative departure date
should be around April 22nd. While we want everyone to relax and have a nice
trip on the way out, this is not a pleasure trip. It's not a trip in which we
wish to have half the crew or hiding out in quarters or sleeping on sofas till
we get back home. While we hope things go smoothly, we don't know what to expect
so need to be ready for the unexpected. Also note that we will have a ship
available if anyone should need a pod ride home.
I would like confirmation letters by April 19th. If we don't get a confirmation,
other arrangements may be made and your seat given to someone else	. One, two, 
or all three mission managers will be waiting for people to have a discussion at
21:00 on April 19 and again just after midnight on April 20. We will meet you at
the Torus on dock Alpha. We hope to see you there but understand if you cannot
make the meeting and/or the trip.
We hope to have more exact departure information at this gathering. We also hope
to be able to answer questions that you might have. Finally, we hope to have
battlesuit assignments sorted. Therefore, if I have not spoken to you about
battlesuits, please list a couple of suits that you can work well with in your
confirmation letter. Also, if you could care less about having to use a
battlesuit, let us know.
Melinda

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Subject: Where does beacon payout come from?
Author: Something_Wicked
Posted: Thu Apr 19 19:54:09 2018 UTC

I would like to know where all the money comes from when it goes to us, where
exactly the money the government gets from our beacons comes from and where that
goes, and how this all works with Accord and Steel Phoenix and pilots affiliated
to one, the other or both. If I missed anything, feel free to tack on a
question.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling
bell, a small dusky pink trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a bag
of felo treats, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow
and orange aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the
arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

well, I'll never forget that lesson."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Galleon will be mothership of fortress."
Damien Goss says, "Just amek sure the person you are sending home doesn't link

bikini modeling potential that was hoped for."

somethin."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Even if they like basking in light very
much."
Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew.
Ted Warburton says, "I can see this being a word for blowing things up, or
popping in the future."
Blake Madison says, "Popping for havingg a ship destroyed never sat right with
me."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I will be very clad if translation device
work, trying to talk with childrens was very awkward."
Melinda Michaels grins.

like."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda
Michaels's shoulder.
Kani Kahakai says, "Including them not being fuzzy at all."
Tobias Hawthorne grins at Damien Goss.
"Speaking of bald, did you like your gift?" Evenia Callseah grins at Damien
Goss.
Melinda says to you, "No felo, lizards are fine. And, how many aquariums do you
guys have?"
Damien Goss says, "I didn't open it."

"Of course it was." Evenia Callseah nods to Damien Goss. "But I thought the
feathers might keep that poor head warm. Just like the bow, you know."
You say to Melinda, "I could be wrong on the number that Lily has."

Evenia puts on a fake offended expression.
Damien Goss pokes Evenia Callseah in the ribs! "Stop that shit."

Morris says to Blake, "I got room. Gel too."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Just whatever can fit in your quarters, keeping in mind
you have a roommate who might also want to bring stuff. Speaking for my ship."
Melinda says to Blake, "We can put yours with ours since you just have the one."

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "If we don't come back by time robot stop
feeding, we will probably run out of charge."
Damien Goss nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Evenia Callseah says, "I can care for pets as well."
Ted Warburton says, "Felo are more of an issue, because they need more
intervension."
Evenia Callseah says, "But um, might be better to take Mel up on her offer. She
doesn't have the whole felo world."
Ted Warburton says, "The wild ones."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "You can put one aquarium in the galley of my
ship, but the fishes might go missing over time."

one journey."
You say, "I'll be sure to fill her in."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Even imperator or explorer cannot hold that
many."
Blake Madison says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I like the
the other name better."
Melinda says to Ted, "And I'll let you know which. I need to see who has the who
has the seat."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Very exciting."

that ship belongs to. I think it's the same person anyway. One of them is called
hefty pig and it makes me chuckle."
Evenia Callseah pats Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys on the back.
Melinda Michaels says, "Just don't be crazy or stupid. We don't know anything
about the Fwoof-foom."

You nod.
Ted Warburton nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "We'll be picking who goes out initially."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Sometimes I clear all the keys."

Ted Warburton says, "Don't clear your own key."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Well."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Ted Warburton grins.

Lily Kaise does not seem to have an active communicator.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Lizard people really did not like you
eating."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I dunno what their fwoofy neurosis will be."
Morris Corlew says, "Maybe they won't like hair. We'll all have to shave."
Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Or maybe we don't have enough hair."
Morris Corlew grins.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Bring a pallet of that hair grow thing."

Evenia Callseah says, "I do not wanna have to get all the beads out of this and
the braids. I'll just chop it off if it comes to that."
Ted Warburton says, "Yep."
Morris Corlew chuckles at Nissi Valdaire.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "A very good idea."
Melinda Michaels grins.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Really, though, if they managed to destroy a
mothership. They either have some amazing technology, are super warriors or
master of subterfuges."
Kani Kahakai says, "If I have to shave my head to get there I'd rather stay at
home."
Evenia Callseah blinks.
Melinda Michaels nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Evenia Callseah says, "It's just hair. It grows again."
Morris Corlew pats Kani Kahakai on the back.
Melinda says to Kani, "Really?"
Melinda Michaels grins.
Morris Corlew says, "I shaved mine on a dare once."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Nissi Valdaire says, "We didn't really have any of those things. Just turned
some crazy woman's murder suicide into an ambush."
Morris Corlew says, "Grew back even thicker."
Kani Kahakai says, "I mean, probably not, but I'd be really grumpy."

Nissi Valdaire says into her translucent metachannel FTL communicator, "No

Ted Warburton waves.
Nissi Valdaire glances down at her wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.
Evenia Callseah nods to Ted Warburton. "Used to be around my ears."
Ted Warburton says, "Later."
Melinda Michaels waves to you.
Morris Corlew waves to you.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Isn't this meeting about to start."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

it was to change the manufacturer of my current one."

starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
