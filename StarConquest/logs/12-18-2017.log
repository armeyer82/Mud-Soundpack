01:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider c

Star Conquest Help: Megapod Raids
--
Category: Activities
--
The 'megapod' is a massive Bari infestation (see the Bari help file) of the EAOS Experimental Research Structure, which was abandoned during the Outsider War. An IFS attack several years later catastrophically breached the structure, allowing the Bari access to space. Given the EAOS's penchant for tinkering and genetic engineering, the full extent of the infestation and the nature of the creatures inhabiting the megapod is unknown.

However, you and your fellow civilian pilots can help to uncover the mysteries of the megapod. Through a series of scouting missions, assaults, and raids, you can penetrate ever deeper into the megapod and, with a little luck, even recover some pre-War EAOS technology. To participate, deploy an aerial fortress to the Experimental Research Structure.

Here are the available megapod missions, ordered by difficulty. Missions are not all linear, and sometimes your party will have a choice of where to go. Greater danger often brings greater rewards! One megapod mission may be completed per Conquest period.

SCOUT THE MEGAPOD

A scouting mission ventures just a short distance into one of the megapod's many exterior entrances. By exploring these top level tunnels, you can find ways to move deeper into the megapod.

Recommended Party Size: 5

SHALLOW ASSAULT

Move beyond the entry area of the megapod and see what is brewing ju
02:55 st below the surface.

Requirements: Five scouting missions completed by every would-be participant.

Recommended Party Size: 5

More missions will come in the future!

02:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:02 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

03:04 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:18 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

03:19 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

03:19 You glance at your communicator's screen.

03:20 There are two board posts.
There is one headline.

03:20 Lily Kaise switches a metallic gold touch einrophone off.

03:20 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:20 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

03:20 Lily says to you, "So should we go put our names back in the hat?"

03:20 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:21 You shrug. "I suppose."

03:21 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:21 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:21 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:21 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:21 You say, "Though I'm not going to complain if someone else takes it."

03:21 Lily Kaise says, "I was going over there so."

03:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:21 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:21 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:21 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:21 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:22 Lily Kaise says, "If anyone challenges me, I won't cry in my wine."

03:22 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

03:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:22 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:22 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:22 You laugh.

03:22 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:22 You say, "Yeah, I kind of hope someone does challenge me."

03:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:22 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:22 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:22 Lily Kaise says, "Well I feel similarly as I do't have the time to give what I believe I should."

03:22 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:22 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:22 You nod.

03:22 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:22 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:22 You exit the ship.

You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:25 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, a sheet of white paper, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Mischief the old large black felo here.

03:25 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:25 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:25 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:25 Lily Kaise says, "Going to check the market."

03:25 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:25 You nod.

03:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:26 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:26 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Space Market.

03:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:26 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

03:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

03:26 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:27 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:27 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:28 [Tactical Communication] A robotic voice says, "QE message transfer to Dolia complete."

03:28 Announcement:

03:28 
Merry Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event!

This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However, we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make sure everyone gets a gift!

First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and celebration a little closer to the holiday!

Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos, custom hair styles, small "plastic surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much, please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to add additional lines of text!

Thank you!


03:29 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:29 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:29 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:29 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:30 Lily Kaise says, "What is melinda going on about."

03:30 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:30 You say, "No idea. I'm not listening to General."

03:30 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

03:30 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

03:31 Mischief the old large black felo suddenly jumps onto a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top.

03:31 Lily Kaise says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Welcome back Icy!"

03:32 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:32 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

03:32 A launch trajectory is located.

03:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:32 You say, "I almost amnever tuned into general now-a-days."

03:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:32 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 774" has jumped out of the sector.

03:32 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:33 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

03:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:33 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:33 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:33 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:33 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:33 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 774" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:33 You say, "Well, pretty much never tuned into general."

03:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:33 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:34 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:35 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

03:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:39 Mischief the old large black felo jumps into Lily Kaise's lap and settles in, purring.

03:42 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

03:47 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

03:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:52 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

03:56 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

03:58 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

04:02 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

04:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:16 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Accord missions? Anyone?"

04:17 [Tactical Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "I can! Probably!"

04:19 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Old Earth."

04:19 Lily says to you, "Should we go lie down Love?"

04:21 You say to Lily, "Sure."

04:21 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:21 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]

You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, and a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing white and fuchsia aquatic life and coral rocks here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

04:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

04:21 You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

04:21 You can't go that way.

04:21 You can't go that way.

04:21 You remove all of your clothing, placing it carefully in a small suitcase.

04:21 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

04:21 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

04:21 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:22 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:22 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

04:24 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Last call for Accord missions."

04:26 [Tactical Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "Let me just drop off this probe thing."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

14:39 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and Cheri-Pye the old large light violet felo here.
You can go out.
