-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

In an attempt to fix minor inconsistencies, several help files have been
changed.  HELP LEAGUE POLITICS, HELP AEU POLITICS, and HELP FRINGE POLITICS have
all been edited slightly, with HELP LEAGUE PARTIES, HELP AEU PARTIES, and HELP
FRINGE PARTIES adding back a list of the various political entities in those
alliances.  HELP ALLIANCE GOVERNMENTS has been removed, and in its place are
HELP LEAGUE GOVERNMENT, HELP AEU GOVERNMENT, HELP FRINGE GOVERNMENT, HELP EAOS

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

Hi Love,
It is now estimated that we will depart on this Expedition in as early as in one
to two weeks.
Melinda wants to know which two Battlesuits you are most comfortable with using
and what Tiers you have for low and high. Please let her know by dropping her a
note in the mail or calling.
You may want to bring your Cruiser and/or any other ships you own from New Earth
to the Torus as we have no idea what may follow us up on our return.
As for Felo, after 30 days have elapsed, we'll have to find reliable people to
transport our felo ships to the landing pad and feed from the Repair shop. I may
just downsize what I currently have from the Mule because I've tried to maintain
Soldiers in the Mule and just have a handful. I have a number of Soldiers and
otherwise in the other ship so may combine the soldiers from the mule and take
the others to Hyperion. At any rate, since noone else can reset the robots but
whomever owns them, after 30 days and if we've not returned, this means someone
should transport the ships to the Landing area and feed from the Repair shop or
manually feed from bags of chow. Obviously, if it is an AEU pilot, they won't
necessarily be feeding manually. The cost is 250K credits per feeding per ship
so would need to advance whomever feeds for you the credits. I personally don't
have anyone in mind either as Kim probably would do it but she isn't at work
very often. I'm sure the felo would likely be ok for a few days after the robots
stop Caretaking so they may manage if we aren't away beyond 35 to 37 days. I
will put Shine and Sunshine into my Pulsar as it has 16 rooms or if you wouldn't
mind, I can put them in your Cruiser as I can put down more bowls. or I could
use the organization's Cruiser for them as it has so many more rooms and they
would be ok for months, perhaps over six months since just the two don't require
much Felo Chow.
I'll bring the fish tanks and worst case, we keep them on a hoverpallet and feed
manually.
We need to be certain that we make preparations to be ready to depart with short
notice for as soon as a in a week or two. I hope it's the latter so I can put up
our next scoop so that we would have at least one working for us for 16 days.
I'll at least have one or two ready to deploy.
I'm sure glad I thought to prepare the organization's assets.
I love you,
Lily

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Melinda,
For battle suits I have: Testudinidae (tiers 3 and 5), Fringe (tier 4), AEU
(tiers 3 and 5) and EAOS (tiers 3 and 4). I am most comfortable with AEU tier 3,
Fringe 4 and EAOS 3 and 4. I can use the other suits as well, but am not as
comfortable. Hope this helps.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

ourselves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah I said the same
thing. Like why can't we just form a Pilot Owned Corporation or have a trust set
up. After all there are employee-owned companies. We could also sell shares to
the interested parties as well."

out from the government is they would allow that. That might be the only way
that we regain control."

A large semi-transparent spherical creature with narrow dangling tendrils and an

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In my mind, if
we could outbid everyone on exploration, which seems like it shouldn't even be
that hard, maybe we could make a ton of money off of it and use that to buy
other pieces."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No one is going
to really want the exploration activities, at least not at any high price."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oops."

really want the exploration activities, at least not at a high price."

I've earned, but in a general sort of sense."

were even possible, we'd likely need the AEU orgs to buy in heavily."

a question for you, if you don't mind."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Kason, you may
be able to answer this as well. I have my alliance 10 channel tuned in and I
keep getting periodic notifications about our progress What are the best ways to
achieve those goals those notifications keep talking about?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Certainly. Conquest
periods last four days, I believe, and are the periods that the AEU liason is
referring to. There are certain goals set for our performance, though I believe
the only person who can identify the exact nature of the goals is the corps'
Industrial Whip, from what others have told me, and we do not have one at the
moment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Well
they keep saying something along the lines of, "We're making progress towards
our goals. But I am not seeing anything.""
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Each period has two
goals, one lower than the other. In the most recent period we reached our first
goal. You can contribute to the overall value by participating in industrial
activities, like salvaging and the like, or in combat, or in exploration, the
like."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. I can do
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Just so. I believe
that what the most advantageous way to contribute is might change due to various
factors, but as we don't have any way of identifying that right now you might as
well just try to be as productive as possible, more or less."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Should you desire to
make headway on industry points, getting a cargo hauler and using it to salvage
debris is one of the more efficient routes. There's a temporary station you can
transfer the salvage one sector east of the Steel Phoenix that will yield higher
profits than selling at one of our planets, too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Really?
Where do I have to jump to for that transfer?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "You can jump directly
to the Steel Phoenix - it has its own beacon that your nav system will
recognize. From there you'll need to move to the eastern border of the sector
and manually move over to the adjacent one. Then you'll see a station you can
dock with. However, payment isn't as immediate as selling at a planet, but I
find the increased return worth the wait."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly
Strike! Welcome to home space!"
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU
transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at
New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully

Hello friends,
If you are receiving this letter, you have been selected by Melinda, Pierre, and
Damien to come on the first contact mission that the EAOS has spoke of in the
headlines. This date is not set in stone, but the tentative departure date
should be around April 22nd. While we want everyone to relax and have a nice
trip on the way out, this is not a pleasure trip. It's not a trip in which we
wish to have half the crew or hiding out in quarters or sleeping on sofas till
we get back home. While we hope things go smoothly, we don't know what to expect
so need to be ready for the unexpected. Also note that we will have a ship
available if anyone should need a pod ride home.
I would like confirmation letters by April 19th. If we don't get a confirmation,
other arrangements may be made and your seat given to someone else	. One, two, 
or all three mission managers will be waiting for people to have a discussion at
21:00 on April 19 and again just after midnight on April 20. We will meet you at
the Torus on dock Alpha. We hope to see you there but understand if you cannot
make the meeting and/or the trip.
We hope to have more exact departure information at this gathering. We also hope
to be able to answer questions that you might have. Finally, we hope to have
battlesuit assignments sorted. Therefore, if I have not spoken to you about
battlesuits, please list a couple of suits that you can work well with in your
confirmation letter. Also, if you could care less about having to use a
battlesuit, let us know.
Melinda

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I think is
around 250 or 300 industry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I wouldn't put a lot of
extra stuff other than from a speciall little mission that... hmm I wonder if
AEU Cadets can still do that one so never mind but No, I wouldn't invest a lot
in a Cargo Hauler."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "So don't worry
about upgrading this grapple or anything?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I also highly encourage
you to go to Space Vermin Patrol and do every possible mission from their as
well as talk to the Officer just inside of our Liaison Office Building for some
special assignments."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Most upgrades
aren't really permanent. Even if you did upgrade the grapple, you could
"upgrade" it back to the worst grapple and store your good one at the shop."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then put it on
your new ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I talked to
that guy. I shot up a rats ship, but my weapons got damaged and I lost a lot of
the hull's failsafe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though if I
could do it all over again, I would probably just forego salvaging entirely
until I qualified for the ultimate salvage sensor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well damage comes with
the project so just repair and go on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. I will
try athat out again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Am I free to
transfer what ever I unload at the station east of phoenix command? Or is that
someone else's job?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, transfer
it at your leisure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You won't
actually get points or money until you transfer the station's load."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So when you're
done with your salvage you may as well."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Cool.
This is the second load I bring. So I will transfer it. Am I at the right one?
It says it's fringe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that
should be right, so long as it's east of Steel Phoenix Command."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "It is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Do fringe have
stations like this all over the place, or is this one unique?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We are working with
the Fringe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a temporary
station that one of us built."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Okay."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at Fringe Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
one-person cargo hauler "Desert Snake". The organization has earned 194,127.59
credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "So, in consideration
of them, we are using their core for the salvage processor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We used parts
from fringe orgs so that fringe orgs as well as our own will get the money."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Since ringe credits
are technically worth more than AEU ones."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We will alternate
between AEU and Fringe on both of the Salvage and Battle Scanning stations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So Elijah sometimes you
will see AEU there and other times Fringe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "This will also help
their civilian pilots accumulate resources, which will hopefully make their
government reconsider discountinuing it for the foreseeable future."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The core for the
battle scanner makes no difference in credits. Everyone gets their alliance's
credits regardless."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It only makes a
difference for the salvage processor and the asteroid scanner, really."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Oh-kay? I
ordered a station transfer, and an unmanned pickup vehicle seems to have docked
and undocked, but I have not gotten payed, to my knowledge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It takes a bit
of time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just go about
your business. You'll be notified when it transfers and you get paid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Lovely.
Alright."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, you don't have
to stay there. You don't even have to be awake or active or anything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Brilliant. I
now have 15 industry points!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "All the woos."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright.
Heading back for that midnight appointment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok are you available
now Ather?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm working on a
crafting project."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok then let us know
when you're available."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Go without me, it's a
couple hours project; it's a stun cannon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm somebody left their
shipsuit over here on the Lounge bar. I hope they didn't go skinny-dipping under
the bridge!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

you don't need that for a Battlesuit did you go down into the basement Elijah?"

out a loan. I have a battle suit now, just outfitting it."

should I get? And what modules?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm partial to 3
or 4 second-firing weapons, that way you can shoot between minor repairs."

minidrones module."

assistant is hurting now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Should I get
armor module as well? Or can that wait?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup that happens when
you're just getting started. That is why I say do all of the missions you can
get from the Liaison Officer and from space Vermin Patrol. Those pay fairly
well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You don't want
armor on that suit typically."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Then I think I
am ready."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No no armor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll make the
money back. You can do 8 low priority deployments per conquest, those pay a
bit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And then yeah,
you can do a space vermin patrol mission every day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Done.
So Just leave it here? And they will put it on the area fortress for us? Or do I
have to ask them to store it somewhere?"
