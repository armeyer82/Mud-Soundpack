You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

14:03 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

14:03 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a small dusky pink trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a bag of felo treats, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

14:03 [The Torus; Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You can go up.

14:03 I don't understand that.

14:03 [The Torus; Garage]

14:03 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You can go up.

14:03 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Airlock]

14:03 You see a glossy blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a felo nest, a runtish orange felo, and an orange soldier felo here.

14:07 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]

14:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

14:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Not too bad."

14:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And Lily told me you may need someone to keep an eye on your felo?"

14:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, that would help."

14:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I was going to talk to you about that."

14:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, at least you do know I read mail, right?"

14:08 An old average-sized orange soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

14:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yep, I was planning on sending you a letter later today."

14:09 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

14:09 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

14:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Just mail me the keys and tell me where the ships are? A credit chip is not needed as Lily already gave me about uh, way many times more than I need for a bit of felo feeding."

14:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh ok. No problem. I can do that."

14:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.

14:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

14:15 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:15 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

14:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

14:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:17 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:17 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:18 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:18 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:19 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Yep."

17:25 Minor Change: The discoverers of a point of interest will now be determined, sensibly enough, at the moment it is actually discovered, instead of only when it is studied. Among other things, this will ensure that all crew of all ships in a linked formation get credit.

18:04 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Can I get three for a deep?"

19:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, cool. Maybe we'll try to put something together."

19:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries."

19:48 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Okay, who would be interested in a deep pod?"

19:48 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How many do you need."

19:49 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "If everyone who was in before is still in, one."

19:49 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I'll go if noone else is around who needs a deep."

19:49 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "If they are not, then some number greater than one."

19:51 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Elaine?"

19:51 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Can do."

19:52 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Perfect. When Mel is ready we will go."

20:26 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

21:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Hello. Is anyone interested in doing a space vermine patrol with me? I am still trying to get a hang of gunning, but I cannot concentrate on that when I am flying."

21:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah in a hesitant voice, "as I am still getting a hang of flying itself. You know?"

22:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Elijah, sorry, I was dozing earlier."

22:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Those missions aren't the greatest for doing with a partner."

22:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If it will help you I'll come fly for you sometime and get you some practice shooting rats or something."

22:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Quite alright. I'm in the middle of the sector now. Effecting repairs, but I am almost at about 45 percent on turrets 3 and 2."

22:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah okay. Well, there's no shame in taking a quick jaunt home if your guns get shot out. You're free to leave and return to the sector in those missions."

22:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Yeah. I'm too far from them right now, so I'm not being fired on."

22:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Never mind."

22:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I only have one turret left. Oh well."

22:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't forget your torpedo launcher."

22:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In fact, when you're starting out a single torpedo is often enough to dispose of a rat when your guns would take several shots."

22:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm saying these things assuming that you're in a fighter and not a cargo hauler or something."

22:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "In a fighter."

22:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Got them all."

22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "My goodness! Just blew them all up!"

22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, have you talked to that guy on the Space Vermin Patrol Command landing pad?"

22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "All it cost me was four laser turrets and some hull damage. But I am dealing with that."

22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "He will set up your ship to pull cores off the rats."

22:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Yeah. I got some cores I think. Let me start heading back towards spinward and I can check the cargo bay."

22:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool, those are pretty handy. Cash and industry points, I believe. If you ever turn in a bunch and he won't take any more, just hang onto them and try again the next day."

22:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "And I can get my ship repaired while I am there. A win win, I think."

22:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes."

22:20 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

22:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Oh. I only got two rats cores even though I blew up three ships. Hmm."

22:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I sware, is the fellow on AEU channel ten ever satisfied?"

22:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "He almost was, once."

22:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I don't believe he liked it."

22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Did Hell freezing over stop him from being satisfied?"

22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski laughs.

22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You won't get an intact core from every ship."

22:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Well, I'll turn in these two and see about going out again. I think I have a strategy, but let's see if it works. I still have a bit of trouble avoiding getting hit while gunning, but if I can blow them up fast enough, then that should work, I think."

22:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you can't dodge rats drills."

22:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't feel like you're doing a bad job of dodging."

22:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Alright. Then I'll just take it like a starship."

22:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The only you can really do it limit your exposure to multiple rats."

22:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's good to move a bit while shooting if you can so that you don't have dozens of them in range of you at once, drilling pieces of ship off."

22:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Do those drills go farther than our weapons? Only sometimes, I feel like I get hit, and I still can't track them."

22:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, they should need to be right next to you to hit you with the drills."

22:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure why you would be having trouble tracking them -- are you certain you weren't already tracking something else?"

22:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Then maybe they move right after I target, or I track when I am moving. Still learning this."

22:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or maybe he's a black market reseller."

22:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. I was wondering, so I did a nest two days ago, and they dropped me on Chetumal, so my battlesuit is over there. Might you or someone with a fortress help me bring it back to New Earth?"

22:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh sure, no problem."

22:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Want to move it now?"
