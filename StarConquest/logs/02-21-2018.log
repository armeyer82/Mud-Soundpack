04:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:04 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
