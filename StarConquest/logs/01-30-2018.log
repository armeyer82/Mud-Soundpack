03:39 [The Torus; Garage]

03:39 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

03:39 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:39 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:39 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:39 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small dusky pink trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

03:39 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:39 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "You know what. I am going to grab a league suit."

03:39 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:39 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Hey wondered where you were!"

03:39 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:40 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Tr tac tier 1 or 2?"

03:40 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Hem trying that again. Tier 1 or 2?"

03:40 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "If you can get 2, for sure that'd be better."

03:40 [Tactical Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Rental 2."

03:40 You laugh.

03:40 You say, "I was in my flare."

03:41 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I forgot to look there. I think I was a bit tired after doing a bit of tesla."

03:41 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:41 You say, "Some Accord peacekeepers got interdicted in A-19 so I went to free them."

03:41 Lily Kaise says, "Oh that's good and glad you helped them."

03:43 You say, "Well, at first fit was supposed to be some Ares."

03:46 You say, "A couple of them, but the Ares disappeared and instead I found the Accord ships trapped with interdictors."

03:46 Lily Kaise says, "That is odd because Ifs don't typically interdict except for one or two classes which aren't seen very often."

03:47 You say, "Yeah, I know."

03:47 You say, "So, my guess is that the Ares left and Merry Band showed up."

03:47 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that's more than likely what happened."

03:58 You say to Lily, "I'm going to go lie down and go to sleep. I love you. Rest well and sweet dreams."

03:58 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:58 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.
