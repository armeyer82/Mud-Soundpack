Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a black
plastic tray of spider chow, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go out.

Dear Lily and Shule,
I have a gift for you for the Holidays since I doubt I will be around to give it
to you at the proper time. It is sort of a combined gift, so one item is for
Lily, and the other is for Shule. It isn't much, but I hope that you guys will
find it to your liking. I'd appreciate it if you could open it until the holiday
for sentimental reasons, however it is completely up to the both of you.
Happy Holidays,
Katina

of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a
small purple ball containing a dingling bell, Purr the humanoid service robot,
and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

Elaine Moreau squints at Wendy Arroyo.
Wendy Arroyo grins at Elaine Moreau.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Don't have to worry about friendly fire when minicannons

Nissi Valdaire grins.
Elaine Moreau says, "Ew, minicannons."
Melinda Michaels says, "Who was that arguing over minis with us the other day."
Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Wendy Arroyo exclaims, "That was me!"
Melinda Michaels says, "Ah yes, mini fan."
You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.
Elaine Moreau says, "I think Lexie was a mini fan, too. But that was on our
channel."
Melinda Michaels says, "Silly people."
Elaine Moreau says, "I want guided missiles. Get the boom where it needs to go."

of technology at another equally or more expensive piece of technology?"
Elaine says to Wendy, "Guided missiles actually exist. But ramming could be
fun."
Wendy Arroyo says, "Also Melinda would stop whining I jam her feed."

Melinda Michaels asks, "Wait, is he a mean one?"
Lily says to Melinda, "Is this a big crowd? If so, could dock Happy and Shule
and I cna sleep in there."

Wendy says to Nissi, "Did you explode?"
Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "I did!"
Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't recommend it."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on
Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief
moment.
Wendy says to Nissi, "That's not bad for your health. Don't let me tell you how
to live your life, but you shouldn't explode too often."
Wendy Arroyo gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Not good, even."
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Damien Goss says, "Everything in moderation as they say."
Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:
Melinda Michaels says, "Let me check the quarters."

there?"

of adventure."
A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Nissi
Valdaire's shoulder.
Melinda Michaels nods.
Melinda says to Nissi, "You got your chocolate bot?"
Nissi Valdaire asks, "What if it's a module that accepts megacredits and
dispenses fond wishes for your health?"
Nissi Valdaire nods to Melinda Michaels.
Melinda Michaels laughs at Nissi Valdaire.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I put it in obs already."
Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person
Accord gemini "Grave Robber".
Lily Kaise says, "I have nelli but will have to go fetch my hover."

even practical to do."

get to bed."
A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the
steaming beverage.
Melinda Michaels laughs.
Kani Kahakai says, "There was one pair of shoes, they aren't even my shoes."
Elaine Moreau says to Kani, "Literally unliveable."

a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
Lily Kaise says, "I sure wish I could interpret those words."

[Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Living Quarters Four]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval
turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo, and Kumquat the big red felo here.

The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the
water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle
impotently.
Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders in from the west.
The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.
Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders out.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Kani you still got your key?"
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Yea, I didn't knock people in the floor."
Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he laughs.
The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.
The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate
from the reactionless drive.
You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.
You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Mel, you wanna let 'em in?"
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Sure."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "We should maybe get a doorbell."
[PA] Nicolette Lawrence: "Or let Morris out."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "No thanks."
You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate
from the reactionless drive.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
The room grows a bit warmer.
You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't
recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.
Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "So nebulous."

Multicolored fish flakes drop from above and float on the surface. The fish
eagerly gobble them up.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Rest well Nissi."
The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over
an overturned tree.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct
hits.

Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
Listen. You need to be careful.
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

Remember what I said.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the
tunnel.

Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders in from the west.
Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders out.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders in from the west.
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Gonna check our course."
[PA] Nicolette Lawrence: "We don't have one."
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders out.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
With a sound like scraping stone, the ship changes direction.
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
A gust of wind blows through the ship, blowing strands of sticky silk like
streamers.
The curtains of silken webbing billow outwards as if blown in a wind that can't
be felt.
The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.
The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into
quickly evaporating smoke.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at
the center.
A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the
canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.
A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of
the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.
Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water
to swirl tremendously.
The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.
