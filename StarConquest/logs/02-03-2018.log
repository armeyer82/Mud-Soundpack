-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:02 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go out.

00:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:05 You're already sitting.

00:05 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:05 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

00:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:05 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "These patriots are pretty decent. I can't remember the last time I completed a decoy beacon drop so fast."

00:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:06 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:06 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:06 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:06 You scramble to your feet.

00:06 [New Earth; Spaceport East]
You can go northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, and west.

00:06 You remove a starship requisition application from a leather briefcase.

00:06 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

You entered: First, I attempt to destroy any interdictors that may impede my escape. Following that, I engage any ships that would prevent my departure such as any chaining ships or ships that are interdicting. I then engage and attempt to destroy  as many of the remaining ships as I can one at a time. My first and foremost goal is to do everything I can to ensure that I have the ability to leave the sector if necessary. Second, I want to destroy as many of the enemy ships as I can so as to prevent them getting closer to civilian locations and providing a very real threat.

2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

You entered: I would still take the same approach as in the question above with the exception of the fact that I would alert everyone over tactical regarding my location, number, and class of ships. I also would request others to respond to assist. With it being a civilian location, it is my duty and responsibility to do everything I can to protect and defend it. Therefore, I would fight as long as necessary until the enemy is repelled or I run out of ships to fly.

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

You entered: I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships depend largely on grid, I don't like running out of grid and the engineer can improve the recharge time of the grid by using advanced tools. Since the engineer needs to be settled in order to use them, I prefer to have the engineer always be ready to recharge the grid or patch the hull in case the ship is hit. 

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

You entered: I notify everyone over tactical of my situation ensuring that I state number and classes of enemy ships. I then attempt to clear a way for me to leave the sector by destroying any interdictors if there are only a few of them and I try to destroy any ships that have me chained to them. If there are many interdictors and they are too spread out, I may not be able to destroy them before more are launched. My best option here then is to keep constantly moving away from the enemy to give the engineer time to repair the hull and for reinforcements to arrive. Landing in the sector is really the last thing I would do unless I felt I had no choice as the engineer cannot use advanced tools to patch the hull.

5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

You entered: We destroy any small ships that may have accompanied the mothership and leave the sector and notify both Steel Phoenix Command and Accord and don't return without a cruiser that as PDB shielding and battle suits. The last mothership could not be destroyed by conventional weapons so attacking it would be futile.

6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

You entered: My priority would be to protect primary beacon sectors and capitol planets. Primary beacon sectors are gateways to capitol planets and the enemy could inhibit a our ability to defend and protect the capitol planet by interdicting primary sectors. Capitol planets have the highest population of civilians and is home to our government and therefore should be protected.

7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?

You entered: I would carry out any orders the commander issued  and encourage my crew to do the same within reason.

8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issued missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?

You entered: I have flown in several salvage ops against, Omega Cartel, "Lambda Cartel and Merry Band ships. I have also responded and fought against siege forces both in AEU space and in other alliance space.

9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?

You entered: I still get hit more often than I'd like.

10. How long do you expect this ship to remain 
00:06 undamaged?

You entered: I expect it to stay undamaged less than a day as I plan to take it out and test it in a beacon as soon as I obtain one. I often get hit at least once during a decoy beacon drop.

11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?

You entered: I'm going to do everything I can to ensure it does not get destroyed, but if it does, it will most likely be during an invasion.

12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?

You entered: Defensive dissidence. I have the title of Phoenix Dissidence , and I obtained this ship to help defend the AEU.

13. You must choose a theme song that you will completely rock out to while fighting. What song do you choose?

You entered: Thunderstruck by ACDC

14. What is your favorite color?

You entered: Red

00:06 [New Earth; Central Stellar Cartography Branch]

00:06 Official-looking lettering declares this to be a branch of Central Stellar Cartography, a galactic mapping organization recognized by all of the alliances. One entire wall of the room is in fact the front of a massive computer which extends into an adjacent room. Technicians constantly feed data into the machine. In the center of the room, a holographic representation of the galaxy is being projected. An extraordinarily tiny dot in one of the galaxy's spiral arms is labeled simply "KNOWN SPACE."

00:07 Try this instead:  submit

00:07 You hand a starship requisition application to a nearby technician, who looks it over. The technician laughs suddenly, then hastily covers it with a cough as they look up at you sheepishly and throw the application into an outgoing bin, saying, "All right, looks like you're all set. You'll hear back in the mail on their decision."

You can go south, up, and out.

00:07 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:07 Your ship is loaded with nothing with any particular destination at the moment.

00:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:07 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

00:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:05 You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! Everyone, while I am pleased to see you attempting to engage in Ground Combat work, please be certain not to forget to watch your battlesuit's damage, repair in between battles, take cover if your damage is high and use Repair drones to obtain enough repairs, however small they are, so that you can launch and obtain a repair from the Battlesuit Outfitter. If you need tips on managing your Ground Combat tactics, please seek us out and discuss your questions and concerns. Also, on the conference room table of the Liaison Office building, there is a box which contains two different books on Ground Combat. I suggest that you take and read these books. Regarding another type of work, SEAS has deployed a Temporary Salvage Processing Station in the sector which is just East of Steel Phoenix Command. Simply perform your salvaging work, jump to Steel Phoenix Command, move to 20, 1, 1. Then switch to Manual Piloting Mode and move east by 1 which navigates you out of the Steel Phoenix Command sector. You should be adjacent to the Salvage processing Station. Land on the Temporary Station and transfer your debris. Before you leave, exit your starship and go up to the Control Room and press the 'TRANSFER' button. Then return to your starship, launch, and if you are at 1, 1, 1 then reverse the direction you original navigated to return to the steel Phoenix Command sector. You can then fly ont
15:05 o your next desired destination. The advantage to you is there are no Rats or Pirates to deal with, you will earn more for your debris by transferring to a Temporary Salvage processing station which is sponsored by an organizations or preferably more than one organization. In this instance, you will earn AEU credits as well. We hope to establish a new Battle Scanner for beacon drops and Xenology Researching Temporary Space Stations over the weekend. We are seeking other organizations participation with these projects as well. In the meantime, fly safely! And fight hard on the ground! [14:03  3 February 2318 GST]

22:31 I don't see that here.

22:31 You smile at Lily Kaise.

22:32 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "So fuck those other alliance organizaitons who want to keep us from operating."

22:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah."

22:37 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

22:38 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

22:38 You kiss Lily Kaise.

22:38 You say to Lily, "I'll be back in the ship."

22:38 You smile at Lily Kaise.

22:38 [Pilot Organization Level; Corridor]

22:38 You can go north, east, south, and west.

22:38 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:38 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:38 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:39 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:39 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:39 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

22:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:39 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:39 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:39 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:39 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

22:39 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 455" has launched from New Earth.

22:40 AutoStar detects 4 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

22:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:40 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 455" has jumped out of the sector.

22:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:40 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:40 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

22:40 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:40 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:40 You scramble to your feet.

22:40 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

22:46 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

22:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You can go down and out.

You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:50 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

22:50 You can go down and out.

22:50 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:50 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:50 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

22:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:50 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:51 "endmion" does not match any known sector.

22:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Endymion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:51 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

22:51 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:51 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

22:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:52 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Defensive Dissidence. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:52 A flashing green light indicates that your news has been updated.

22:52 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:54 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Airlock]

22:54 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:54 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

22:54 You can go down and out.

22:54 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

22:54 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:54 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:55 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 326" has jumped into the sector.

22:55 Via general sector communication, Endymion transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 326! Welcome to home space!"

22:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hey love. Where are you?"

22:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:55 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:55 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:55 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

22:55 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:55 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:55 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Defensive Dissidence! Welcome to The Torus!"

22:55 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh I'm still at the torus I came back to change my points contribution and then got sidetracked but I need to at least finish up this mission I signed up for haha."

22:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:56 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

22:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Defensive Dissidence. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

22:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah, ok."

22:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Did you have something in mind?"

22:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:56 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:56 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:56 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Go ahad and finish that mission. I'll be a bit distracted for a bit here."

22:57 Your ship 'Defensive Dissidence' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I mean, go ahead and finish."

22:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok well I like to do beacons but I was trying to wait a bit to see if Ather might at least contribute towards a BAS but I guess we'll just have to do that and get our own pilots into using the stations. Then perhaps he will want to join in."

22:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "So off to tesla I go and I'll see what you're up to afterwards. It's probalby not going to pay much because I'll have waited awhile heh."

23:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh I had to shoot a couple of interdicters on the way and seems the peacekeepers didn't shoot them so they left after I shoot them."

23:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh ok. Yeah, the peacekeepers don't shoot interdictors."

23:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Which makes no sense as they remain trapped."

23:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I agree, but I've had to break them out a couple of times."

23:10 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

23:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go down and out.

23:14 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:14 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:14 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Capital Ship Drydock. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

23:15 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.

23:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:21 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:21 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:21 Your ship 'Defensive Dissidence' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:23 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

23:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go down and out.

23:23 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:23 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:23 The ship is already moving.

23:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:23 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:23 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:23 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:23 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:23 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:23 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Defensive Dissidence! Welcome to home space!"

23:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Defensive Dissidence. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:24 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:31 Once bolted down, this will be impossible to remove. Are you sure?

23:31 [Enter `yes' or `no']

23:31 You carefully set about bolting a decoy beacon launcher to a convenient surface.

23:31 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:31 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:31 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:31 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

23:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I am going for another."

23:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah ok."

23:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Have fun!"

23:31 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

23:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair and a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go down and out.

23:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:32 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:32 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.

23:32 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:32 You sit up onto a dark green leather captain's chair.

23:32 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Defensive Dissidence! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

23:32 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:33 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Defensive Dissidence. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:33 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:33 You remove Shule Elemmire's workbench from a leather briefcase.

Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go down and out.

23:40 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:40 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:40 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:40 The ship is already moving.

23:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Steel Phoenix Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:40 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:40 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
