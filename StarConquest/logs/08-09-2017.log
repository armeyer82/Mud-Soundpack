03:56:25 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

03:56:25 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

03:57:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:57:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:57:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:58:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:58:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:58:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:58:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

03:58:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:58:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:58:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:58:23 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

03:58:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:58:34 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:58:34 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

03:59:15 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:59:20 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

03:59:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

05:30:35 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]

05:30:35 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go up and out.

05:30:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

05:30:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

05:32:36 [The Torus; Dock Beta]

05:32:36 The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, against the starry expanse of space, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. A sign indicates that the main concourse is to the west, and the doorway to a rare starship supply store is to the south, but it has been closed and securely locked.

05:33:24 Constantine Stone walks in from the west.

05:33:26 Constantine Stone waves.

05:33:26 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

05:33:28 You hold Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

05:33:36 The one-person cargo hauler "Long Haul" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

05:33:37 James Donovan exits from the one-person cargo hauler "Long Haul".

05:33:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

05:33:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

05:34:05 James Donovan walks up.

05:34:07 The ship is already moving.

05:34:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

05:34:07 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 759" has jumped out of the sector.

05:34:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Beacon A-14. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

05:34:08 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:34:09 James Donovan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm in the weapons room."

05:34:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Spinward Cluster."

05:34:11 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, I'm out of dumps."

05:34:11 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.

05:35:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:35:46 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

05:35:49 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

05:35:49 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

05:35:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Beta).

05:35:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:36:29 James Donovan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I wish I was in my fighter instead of my cargo hauler, or I might've taken a shot or 2 at them."

05:36:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:36:32 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

05:36:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

05:36:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

05:36:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:36:48 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

05:36:51 Constantine Stone walks out.

05:36:52 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

05:36:52 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

05:36:56 James Donovan walks in from above.

05:38:04 You wave.

05:38:08 James Donovan waves.

05:38:15 James Donovan says, "I'll see you around then."

05:38:22 James Donovan says, "Shame they weren't still there."

05:38:32 James Donovan walks out.

05:38:33 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

05:38:44 You pull a large lever towards you.

05:38:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

05:39:16 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

05:53:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's funny what we take for granted. Whenever you're flying around a ship you haven't upgraded, you're reminded of how lucky you are to be able to upgrade it at all."

05:59:31 You have been idle for an extended period of time.  Please do something in order to avoid being disconnected.

06:01:38 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

06:04:35 You have been idle too long.  Have a lovely evening.
    * You have been disconnected. Please come back soon. *

06:07:30 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Evenia, that was the morning star you were talking about."

06:07:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It was."

06:07:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Or well...Is."

06:08:12 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I had a feeling, as the name humming bird was present, and when I saw it was a morning star, I remembered what you said."

06:08:49 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah. If it's got hummingbird in the name, you can pretty much guarantee it's mine."

06:09:39 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "If you're wondering what I'm doing just sitting around the torus. I've spotted regular EAOS transport activity between the Torus and Centauri, and I am attempting to discover if this is a trade route."

06:18:44 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Any ideas where that pirate vestle might be heading?"

06:19:59 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Pilots."

06:29:12 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Does anyone know where I sell tradegoods on ars magna? I've been watching a merchant vestle doing it for a while, and am imitating that pilot, but I can't find the trading post on this world."

06:30:45 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "This is looking like a waste. How is the merchant transfering cargo if there's no trading post?"

06:37:28 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Does anyone know where I sell tradegoods on ars magna? I've been watching a merchant vestle doing it for a while, and am imitating that pilot, but I can't find the trading post on this world."

07:01:40 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

08:01:40 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

08:23:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ugh. I passed out very unexpectedly."

09:01:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Woo! I didn't realize that pretty much a stock fighter could take out Reapers."

09:02:41 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

09:50:58 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Dakhal!"

09:51:10 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm awake, I think. Hi."

09:51:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I have a very important question."

09:51:53 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "And what's that?"

09:52:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Actually 2 questions. The first. Why are you not salvaging all the things? The second. Am I weird?"

09:52:59 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I actually did salvage quite a few things. And.. define "weird"."

09:53:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Just simply...am I weird? Would you describe me as, weird?"

09:53:55 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I consider anyone that enjoys salvaging to be a bit off. But I'd not say you're weird."

09:54:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ha! Thank you. You may go back to half-sleeping now."

09:56:38 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "As a side note: I will get my revenge for you saying I'm a bit off."

09:57:04 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chortles. "You walked right into that one, buddy."

09:58:11 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, I've managed to get myself just a bit lost, so I'm sure that's enough revenge."

09:59:11 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "How lost?"

09:59:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I must know so that I can define if this is enough revenge."

10:00:04 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, I lack a rift drive and my warp drive isn't working. But I'll probably find my way back."

10:00:23 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I really shouldn't do things like this when I'm so tired."

10:00:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Need some assistance?"

10:00:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Where are you?"

10:00:40 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah, what he said."

10:01:04 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I found myself. I guess this is a poor form of revenge."

10:01:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Alas. My plans for revenge shall have to continue."

10:01:28 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The trick is to always make four lefts."

10:01:58 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Four lefts doesn't make a right."

10:02:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But how right would 4 lefts really be, even if they did make a right?"

10:02:42 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

10:03:04 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "None of the rights."

10:43:01 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Alright, coffee is down. I am awake."

11:03:42 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

11:53:09 [General Communication] Constantine Stone groans.

11:53:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Problem?"

11:53:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, just the ridiculous hour I've stayed awake to."

11:53:54 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean it's a problem, but not a serious one."

11:54:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

11:54:16 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Time to check on my kitten."

11:55:33 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How long do you reckon a bowl of chow will last?"

11:55:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "For a pet? A couple of days. For sure. If not a week. Pets eat less than wild felo."

11:56:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

11:56:28 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh and guess what?"

11:56:33 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's that?"

11:56:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Up for morningstar beacons tomorrow?"

11:56:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man, 100%."

11:56:58 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was just thinking I still need 2."

11:57:04 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "She's plotting some form of revenge for me."

11:57:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "She's fully upgraded, and waiting."

11:57:17 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you mean after the end of this conquest or before?"

11:57:24 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For all my beacon-planning purposes."

11:57:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Either one."

11:57:35 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay. I'm down for whenever."

11:57:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "My credit assistant is crying, but it will be worth it."

11:58:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

11:58:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "All up, it was basically 2 billion."

11:58:35 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wow."

12:03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I think your fort is out of supplies. I'm still empty."

12:03:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I have like 30,000 supplies."

12:03:47 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

12:03:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, let's go back and check."

12:04:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Okay, resupplied."

12:15:06 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eve, do you know who normally gets the 285 beacon?"

12:15:15 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't see it in the notes Lily left me."

12:15:23 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I know SEAS gets the processor."

12:16:15 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Don't quote me. But I think it's meant to be seekers. Kim hasn't been around though. And the rest of them are on that trip. I'd build one myself. But I don't have any passives."

12:16:25 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm."

12:17:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I don't normally build beacons, so I don't have a need for them."

12:17:24 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, if we have any I'll just make one tomorrow."

12:17:40 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But it's just a basic beacon, I think you know how those get built by now."

12:17:46 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

12:17:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You guys have like...a pile of them, on building capital."

12:18:05 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I'll take care of it then."

12:18:59 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "To keep it with a league core, grab one of Nicolette's cores from my spare parts ship or somewhere. If you've got a key to the seekers spare parts ship, grab a battery from there. I don't care where the top comes from."

12:19:15 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

12:19:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Of course you could also just ignore me and do whatever, but that's how I'd handle it."

12:19:50 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

12:20:06 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, I'll do that. The one thing stopping me from just doing it is I didn't know what parts to give to what orgs."

12:20:13 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But this at least gives me some idea of what to use."

12:21:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh yeah. So seekers usually does power. Cats is usually things like processors. Accelloraters etcetera. Surfers and shit are usually cores or stealth."

12:21:38 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That's including vassals obviously."

12:21:46 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought it was more of a per-beacon thing. That's good to know."

12:23:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well sometimes it changes around a bit. But...to be blunt. as long as a beacon goes up. I don't give a damn. If orgs didn't leave enough parts. that's their problem. If you need to. use that message top from libs you guys have aboard one of your ships."

12:23:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

12:23:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Or yell at me and I'll buy whatever."

12:23:56 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

12:24:23 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...Okay, that doesn't include spending insane amounts of megacredits on hyperwave antennas."

12:24:33 [General Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.

12:30:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where do you get the rental suits?"

12:30:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Helios."

12:30:45 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

12:36:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Night pilots."

12:36:07 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Night Eve."

12:36:08 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "What's night?"

13:04:47 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

19:48:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It might be able to regen later."

19:48:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it can. You get it pretty early, I think, but I'm not sure when."

19:49:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Actually I guess it's possible the rental and AEU get their abilities at different point levels, or maybe even different abilities entirely."

19:49:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Do you know how minimods work?"

19:49:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you just equip them."

22:43:14 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, a cedar dresser, a set of funky asymmetrical shelves, a satin bra, a plaid button down shirt, a pair of cotton briefs, a pair of black corduroy jeans, a white silk blouse, a pair of skimpy pink lace bikini cut panties, a pair of flared faded denim jeans, and a pair of white leather sandals here.
Lileah Rose is asleep.
You can go out.

22:43:19 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

22:43:22 You kiss Lileah Rose.

22:43:23 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How did you see me?"

22:43:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "My long-range scanner. I see exactly where you are."

22:43:41 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, nice."

22:44:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not really. I could perform mini rift jumps and find you. And then..."

22:44:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cackles!

22:44:19 You say to a wormhole drive tracer, "Gen So Constantine, steal all of the artifacts Especially the weapons and the spacesuits."

22:44:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You would share a can of sardines and a bottled water with me?"

22:44:40 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hell no."

22:44:40 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So Constantine, steall all of the artifacts. Especailly the weapons and the spacesuits."

22:44:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach growls.

22:44:51 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Especially, even."

22:45:08 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just grabbed an old projectile weapon."

22:45:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You wouldn't do that to me would you, Constantine? The person who helps with the vents? The league that runs awesome nests?"

22:45:58 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Aww."

22:46:11 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, there are still plenty of those smelly clusters of organic lumps out here."

22:46:19 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:47:29 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

22:47:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hmmm. You are 5.88 light-days southwest and very slightly down of me. Hmmm..."

22:47:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was."

22:48:04 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's ok Constantine, I'll come save you. I mean, Firestorm will come save you."

22:48:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Firestorm would never do that to me. She likes me."

22:48:45 I don't understand that.

22:49:02 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And if she tries, I will blast her with my super not-scary twin laser turrets on my runabout."

22:49:08 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Firestorm and I had a talk. All is well now. I reminded her who the boss is."

22:52:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Man...I feel like one of those coffees from that breakfast place on new earth."

22:53:07 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do you think of Sooty, Sweep, Nox, or Vanta."

22:53:13 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For my new felo."

22:53:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I like Vanta."

22:53:52 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, me too!"

22:54:31 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Those coffees are yummy from that place! They're my favorite."

22:54:33 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I might need a crew. Starship Museum's on alert."

22:54:44 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm available."

22:54:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:54:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:54:52 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:54:54 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'll see what's there in afew moments."

22:54:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:54:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:55:07 The ship is already moving.

22:55:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:55:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:55:08 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:55:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

22:55:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:55:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:55:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:55:15 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:55:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

22:55:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:55:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:55:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:55:20 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:55:22 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

22:55:22 --

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:55:22 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

22:55:23 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

22:55:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:55:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:55:46 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:55:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

22:55:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:56:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:56:07 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:56:10 You peer out...

22:56:10 
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin, a personal hoverpallet, and Chuck the humanoid service robot here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

22:56:22 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "On Old Earth."

22:57:30 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Probably they've seen a pirate transport passing by."

22:57:52 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There's nothing there now?"

22:57:57 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Nope."

22:58:02 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:58:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

22:58:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:58:17 The ship is already moving.
