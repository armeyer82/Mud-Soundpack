00:06:39 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
00:06:39 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on Shule Elemmire's lap.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

00:09:58 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

00:11:25 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

00:11:50  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers.

00:16:14 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "A pirate transport in Clarkson's Push. Anyone wanna get it?"

00:16:30 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Sure!"

00:16:39 [Tactical Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "I would, but i'm a bit far out in the rift for that."

00:17:25 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

00:20:25 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo jumps down from Lily Kaise's lap.

00:20:25 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

00:21:26 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Anyone out at 285."

00:21:54 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "No clue. I'm out at the graves."

00:22:06 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Was hoping someone was."

00:22:17 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Sorry."

00:23:03 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I have had an unforunate circumstance occur and could use someone to haul this rock in with me on it."

00:23:25 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

00:23:47 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

00:23:49  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers.

00:23:49 You are carrying nothing.

00:25:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Do not suppose either of you could assist?"

00:25:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Assist in what?"

00:25:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am lost on an asteroid."

00:26:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hmmm, that might be tough for us to help with. Where is the asteroid?"

00:26:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I went east of the station in 285."

00:26:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You are on an asteroid?"

00:27:14 Lily Kaise asks, "Oh yeah but wonder o we could go there and hop onto any stationary asteroids and haul them in?"

00:27:20 You laugh.

00:27:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:27:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yes."

00:27:30 Lily Kaise asks, "Want to try?"

00:28:03 You frown.

00:28:11 You say, "I don't know there is much we can do."

00:28:13 Lily Kaise says, "Then if he's on there, he will just get dumped at the asteroid station."

00:28:24 You say, "Oh true."

00:28:25 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

00:28:44 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it might be tough wandering around on those. That wasn'tmy thought."

00:28:48 Lily Kaise says, "Wasn't."

00:28:49 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "What you need vernos?"

00:28:50 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:28:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "About the best thing we could do is try to haul your asteroid to the nearest station. How many sectors o were you?"

00:29:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I mean, how many sectors out are you?"

00:29:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Not far."

00:29:39 You say, "So helpful."

00:29:43 You frown.

00:29:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Two about I believe."

00:29:47 Lily Kaise shrugs. "Heh yeah."

00:29:52 Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:29:57 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:29:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You're lost on the surface?"

00:30:04 You say, "Ok. Let's go try to find him."

00:30:07 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

00:30:08 Lily Kaise stands up from your lap.

00:30:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We're coming out there."

00:30:14 Lily Kaise holds your hand, taking you into her group.

00:30:17 Lily Kaise glides out.

00:30:18 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:30:19 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:30:20 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

00:30:21 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:30:21 You exit the ship.

00:30:21 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go up.

00:30:22 Some lights on the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "RockIt!" flash as Lily Kaise boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

00:30:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yup constantine."

00:30:27 The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "RockIt!" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved to the launching area.

00:30:28 [Starship "Rockahaulic"; Airlock]

00:30:29 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:30:32 [Starship "Rockahaulic"; Control Room]

00:30:33 You can go up and out.

00:30:34 [Starship "Rockahaulic"; Airlock]

00:30:35 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

00:30:35 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

00:30:35 The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 670" and the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "RockIt!" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

00:30:37 [Starship "RockIt!"; Airlock]

00:30:37 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:30:39 [Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]

00:30:39 You see a small lavender trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick gold fringe, a large white and dusky pink paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small pink ball containing some crinkly paper, and a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with purple and pale purple dragonflies on it here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go up and out.

00:30:40 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

00:30:43 You laugh.

00:30:43 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:30:45 You say, "I'm here."

00:30:47 Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:30:49 Lily Kaise sits down on a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with purple and pale purple dragonflies on it.

00:30:50 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:30:51 [Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location.

Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a small lavender trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick gold fringe, a large white and dusky pink paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small pink ball containing some crinkly paper, and a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered wi
00:30:51 th purple and pale purple dragonflies on it here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat.
You can go up and out.

00:30:56 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:30:57 You sit down on a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with purple and pale purple dragonflies on it.

00:31:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "RockIt!, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:31:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:31:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "On our way."

00:31:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:31:17 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:31:19 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:31:20 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:31:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

00:31:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:31:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:31:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:31:28 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: |kR1yd|zV)\ii<a~o<&yYr?-+cQ=+H-3:Ymu4z>*
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:31:28 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

00:31:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:31:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:31:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:31:33 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:31:33 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

00:31:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:31:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:31:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:31:38 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:31:38 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

00:31:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:31:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:31:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:31:46 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2147 light-minutes per second from Galactic Northnortheast and Slightly Up."

00:31:46 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'RockIt!.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

00:31:50 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:31:53 Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

00:31:53 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 178,090.92 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

00:31:53 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:32:03 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:32:04 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:32:13 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

00:32:25 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:32:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It will take us about 10 minutes to get to 285 initially."

00:32:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well I am trying to use that ten minutes wisely."

00:33:19 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

00:33:23 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

00:33:25 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

00:33:38 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

00:33:44 You say to Lily, "I love you hun."

00:37:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Got to be close I just saw an anchor but which one is it."

00:39:11 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:39:59 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

00:40:16 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

00:40:24 Shule runs his fingers though your hair.

00:40:27 Lily Kaise says, "Heh we may be going out for nothing. I guess wouldn't hurt to haul a couple at least if he finds his way."

00:40:34 You say, "Yeah."

00:40:36 You grin.

00:40:37 Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:40:46 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

00:40:53 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

00:42:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Did you find the ship? The anchor must be a short distance from the ship."

00:42:13 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

00:42:13 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

00:42:16 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Thank you for travelling all this way for your asteroid hauling needs. Please enjoy the supply of asteroids while they last. Beware of pirates, IFS, and other such hostile ships. If at all possible get ship class information when you report over tactical and land on one of the stations to be safe. To get home just travel back to Home beacon alpha 286. There is currently no charger available so if you plan to spend the night remember to power down your ship."

00:42:24 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

00:42:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:42:29 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

00:42:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:42:31 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

00:42:32 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

00:42:34 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

00:42:37 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

00:42:39 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

00:42:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:42:53 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

00:42:55 The starship transitions into another sector.

00:43:03 Lily Kaise says, "Ok at least not here."

00:43:07 You nod.

00:43:08 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

00:43:13 The starship transitions into another sector.

00:43:15 The computer reports the presence of an asteroid.

00:43:17 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

00:43:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:43:18 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

00:43:20 You say, "Here maybe."

00:43:46 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

00:43:47 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid (nearest).

00:43:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:43:57 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:43:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok we're in the second sector. Hopefully it's this one."

00:44:05 Lily Kaise removes a bulky asteroid supply cannon from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

00:44:10 You remove a bulky asteroid supply cannon from a leather briefcase.

00:44:21 Lily Kaise removes spacesuit components from a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side and quickly dons them.

00:44:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:44:26 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

00:44:26 [Enter `yes' or `no']

00:44:27 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

00:44:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward an asteroid.

00:44:28 You stand up from a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with purple and pale purple dragonflies on it.

00:44:30 [Starship "RockIt!"; Airlock]

00:44:30 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:44:35 You peer out...

00:44:35 
[Comet Surface]
You stand on a barren grey surface. Craters, rocks, and small pockets of dust are all that break the monotony.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "RockIt!" is parked here.
You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I found one anchor but no ship around it."

00:44:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the asteroid's surface.

00:44:41 Lily Kaise glides in.

00:44:50 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

00:44:51 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

00:44:54 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

00:44:58 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

00:45:00 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

00:45:01 You exit the ship.

00:45:02 [Comet Surface]
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "RockIt!" is parked here.
You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.
Lily Kaise exits from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "RockIt!".

00:45:04 Lily Kaise just went north.

00:45:05 [Comet Surface]

00:45:05 You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

00:45:08 You raise a bulky asteroid supply cannon to your eye and begin carefully aiming at the asteroid's surface through the scope.

00:45:08 (17 seconds roundtime.)

00:45:25 After a few careful seconds aligning everything in the scope, it flashes the okay to fire. You pull the trigger and an anchor shoots rapidly from the barrel of a bulky asteroid supply cannon! You lift off the asteroid's surface slightly, landing as the anchor finishes securing itself.

00:45:27 You raise a bulky asteroid supply cannon to your eye and begin carefully aiming at a single-use asteroid anchor through the scope.

00:45:27 (48 seconds roundtime.)

00:46:15 The scope flashes the okay to fire. You pull the trigger and a ribbon shoots from the barrel to automatically secure itself to a single-use asteroid anchor with an attached line.

00:46:20 You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

00:46:21 Use what?

00:46:24 You raise a bulky asteroid supply cannon to your eye and begin carefully aiming at the asteroid's surface through the scope.

00:46:24 (11 seconds roundtime.)

00:46:35 After a few careful seconds aligning everything in the scope, it flashes the okay to fire. You pull the trigger and an anchor shoots rapidly from the barrel of a bulky asteroid supply cannon! You lift off the asteroid's surface slightly, landing as the anchor finishes securing itself.

00:46:36 You raise a bulky asteroid supply cannon to your eye and begin carefully aiming at a single-use asteroid anchor through the scope.

00:46:36 (43 seconds roundtime.)

00:47:19 The scope flashes the okay to fire. You pull the trigger and more ribbon line shoots out to automatically secure itself to a single-use asteroid anchor with an attached line. It quickly spools itself up, tensioning tightly over your ship. Hopefully it will hold.

00:47:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Once I was setting anchors and I ran into someone who had landed after me."

00:47:30 I don't understand that.

00:47:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Leading me to believe the computers all choose very close landing sites."

00:47:34 [Starship "RockIt!"; Airlock]

00:47:34 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:47:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But that may have just been luck."

00:47:52 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

00:47:52 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:47:57 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

00:47:59 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

00:48:04 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

00:48:05 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

00:48:06 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

00:48:07 A sharp crack is heard throughout the ship as the anchors on either side deploy with explosive force, biting deep into the surface of the asteroid.

00:48:09 I don't understand that.

00:48:11 I don't understand that.

00:48:13 [Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]

00:48:13 You see a small lavender trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick gold fringe, a large white and dusky pink paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small pink ball containing some crinkly paper, and a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with purple and pale purple dragonflies on it here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go up and out.

00:48:17 The ship's engines fire, and the anchored asteroid gradually begins to move toward League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station.

00:48:18 The computer reports that the asteroid is approximately two sectors from its destination.

00:48:21 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

00:48:21 [Enter `yes' or `no']

00:48:22 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

00:48:26 You sit down on a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with purple and pale purple dragonflies on it.

00:48:27 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:48:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok here we go let's hope this is it."

00:48:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "If it is a comet, I would say you found the right one."

00:48:56 You put a gentle kiss on Lily Kaise's space suit helmet.

00:48:58 [Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Comet Surface.
You see a small lavender trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick gold fringe, a large white and dusky pink paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small pink ball containing some crinkly paper, and a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with purple and pale 
00:48:58 purple dragonflies on it here.

00:50:55 The computer reports that the asteroid is less than one sector from its destination.

00:51:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I reckon this occurs sometimes."

00:51:21 You say, "I've never gotten lost on an asteroid."

00:51:29 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah me either."

00:51:48 Lily Kaise says, "I've gotten a little out of sync but I have always figured things out."

00:51:49 As the asteroid falls into the station's collection bay, your ship detaches and heads for the docking bay.

00:51:50 You receive 9,529,153.28 League credits for this asteroid!
Your income is deferred until the temporary station's storage module is transferred to a spaceport.

00:53:04 You laugh.

00:53:06 You grin.

00:53:08 A launch trajectory is located.

00:53:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:53:16 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

00:53:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:53:25 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:53:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok we are going south."

01:35:20 Would you like to land on this asteroid?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

01:35:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward an asteroid.

01:35:22 You stand up from a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with purple and pale purple dragonflies on it.

01:35:22 Lily Kaise places a plain white spacesuit helmet atop her head.

01:35:24 [Starship "RockIt!"; Airlock]

01:35:24 You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:35:25 You place a gold spacesuit helmet atop your head.

01:35:26 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

01:35:28 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

01:35:30 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

01:35:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the asteroid's surface.

01:35:35 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

01:35:37 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

01:35:39 [Starship "RockIt!"; Airlock]

01:35:39 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Metal-rich Asteroid Surface. The hatch appears to be locked. A small, gently pulsing red light near the hatch marks that the airlock currently possesses a hostile environment.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:35:49 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

01:35:57 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

01:35:58 You peer out...

01:35:58 
[Metal-rich Asteroid Surface]
You stand on a barren grey surface. Craters, rocks, and small pockets of dust are all that break the monotony.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "RockIt!" is parked here.
You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

01:35:59 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah dude!"

01:36:20 [Metal-rich Asteroid Surface]

01:36:21 You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

01:36:22 You raise a bulky asteroid supply cannon to your eye and begin carefully aiming at the asteroid's surface through the scope.

01:36:23 (18 seconds roundtime.)

01:36:40 After a few careful seconds aligning everything in the scope, it flashes the okay to fire. You pull the trigger and an anchor shoots rapidly from the barrel of a bulky asteroid supply cannon! You lift off the asteroid's surface slightly, landing as the anchor finishes securing itself.

01:36:42 You raise a bulky asteroid supply cannon to your eye and begin carefully aiming at a single-use asteroid anchor through the scope.

01:36:42 (36 seconds roundtime.)

01:37:18 The scope flashes the okay to fire. You pull the trigger and a ribbon shoots from the barrel to automatically secure itself to a single-use asteroid anchor with an attached line.

You can go up and out.

01:38:55 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

01:38:56 The ship has not been properly anchored!  Anchors must be placed north, south, east, and west of the ship, and lines crossed between them to help secure the ship.

01:39:01 You say, "Uh oh."

01:39:04 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

01:39:06 Lily Kaise glides out.

Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

01:40:49 You press the button to deploy the ship's anchor.

01:40:49 A sharp crack is heard throughout the ship as the anchors on either side deploy with explosive force, biting deep into the surface of the asteroid.

01:40:52 The ship's engines fire, and the anchored asteroid gradually begins to move toward League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station.

01:40:53 The computer reports that the asteroid is approximately five sectors from its destination.

01:41:02 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

01:41:03 [Enter `yes' or `no']

01:41:04 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

01:45:07 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Why thank you."

01:46:02 The computer reports that the asteroid is approximately one sector from its destination.

01:47:25 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:47:29 The computer reports that the asteroid is less than one sector from its destination.

01:47:33 Lily Kaise says, "Finally."

01:47:42 Lily Kaise says, "And I think this one is finally."

01:47:49 I don't see that here.

01:47:54 Lily Kaise says, "We may have a bit of a trek back."

01:47:56 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:47:58 You nod.

01:48:05 As the asteroid falls into the station's collection bay, your ship detaches and heads for the docking bay.

01:48:05 You receive 16,163,560.47 League credits for this asteroid!
Your income is deferred until the temporary station's storage module is transferred to a spaceport.

01:48:48 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:48:53 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

01:49:46 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

01:49:49 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

01:49:51 A launch trajectory is located.

01:49:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:49:53 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:49:56 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:49:57 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

01:49:59 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:50:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:50:02 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

01:50:05 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:50:06 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:50:09 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

01:50:15 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:50:16 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:50:16 The starship has left a unique area of space.

01:50:25 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

01:50:52 You say, "Not bad actually."

01:51:19 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah better than when we came out. Perhaps it's the other one which caused us to be slower or lack thereof."

01:51:28 You nod.

01:51:48 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:51:54 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:53:08 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:53:17 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

01:53:20 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:53:22 You snuggle up to Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:53:29 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:55:49 Lily Kaise asks, "Will stop by Belt Management on the way back to New Earth if it's ok?"

01:56:37 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:56:37 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

01:56:40 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Solar Autonav Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

01:56:40 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Passively Beaconed Solar Autonav Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:56:47 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

01:56:48 You say, "Sure."

01:56:50 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:56:51 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

01:57:18 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:57:20 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2333 light-minutes per second from Galactic Northnortheast and Slightly Up."

01:57:22 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

01:57:23 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:57:23 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

01:57:34 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:57:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to The Glittering Belt. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:57:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:57:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:57:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:57:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:57:42 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:57:42 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

01:57:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:57:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:57:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:57:46 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:57:47 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Glittering Belt."

01:57:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:57:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:57:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:57:51 This asteroid belt is unusually close to its star, and the slowly rotating asteroids glitter brightly in the sunlight.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Space Station Delta in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:57:54 Via general sector communication, Space Station Delta transmits, "Hello there, RockIt!! Welcome to home space!"

01:57:57 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:58:01 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid Belt Management Station.

01:58:04 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:58:27 I don't understand that.

01:58:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:58:47 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

01:58:49 Lily Kaise stands up from your lap.

01:58:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

01:58:56 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

01:58:58 Lily Kaise glides out.

01:59:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:59:02 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:59:03 You scramble to your feet.

01:59:03 [Starship "RockIt!"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:59:05 You exit the ship.

01:59:05 [Asteroid Belt Management Station]
The four-person mule "Liberator", the scout "Pathseeker", the two-person Accord gemini "Amaterasu", the two-person light transport "Dreamstar", and the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "RockIt!" are parked here.

02:00:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:00:34 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 076" has jumped out of the sector.

02:00:35 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:00:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:00:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:00:37 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:00:38 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:00:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:00:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:00:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:00:42 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 670" has landed on the planet New Earth.

02:00:45 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, RockIt!! Welcome to home space!"

02:00:47 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:00:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:00:51 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:00:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:01:11 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Who sent me mai, and is it important?"

02:01:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:01:18 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:01:19 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Erm, mail."

02:01:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, RockIt!. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:01:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:01:27 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Did you courier?"

02:01:30 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Courier?"

02:01:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:01:35 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:01:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:01:38 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:01:39 Lily Kaise stands up from a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed pillow, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus blossom design, and a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with purple and pale purple dragonflies on it.

02:01:43 You're already standing.

02:01:48 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:01:52 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:01:53 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Oh, its friday?"

02:01:54 Lily Kaise grins.

02:01:57 You grin.

02:01:58 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yep."

02:02:09 Lily Kaise says, "Ok guess I should check the office and i'll be back in dove."

02:02:12 You say, "Ok."

02:02:13 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Okay, so that be it. Thank yous."

02:02:15 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:02:19 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:02:25 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:02:27 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:02:28 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:02:30 [Starship "RockIt!"; Airlock]

02:02:30 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:02:31 You exit the ship.

02:02:31 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

02:02:33 Go where?

02:02:36 Go where?

02:02:38 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

02:02:38 Even though this starship garage smells like machine oil and heavy lubricants, it is spacious and well-lit. Massive hydraulic systems raise and lower starships to and from the landing pad above, and technicians and mechanics in silvery gray coveralls ensure that everything keeps running smoothly. A well-lit stairway which leads to the pilot's lounge is here.
You can go up.

02:02:39 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

02:02:39 The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 670" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

02:02:41 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

02:02:41 You see a friendly cadet orientation officer here.
You can go north, up, and out.

02:02:42 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

02:02:42 You can go north, east, south, and west.

02:02:42 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]
You can go north, east, south, and west.

02:02:42 You rapidly enter a few numbers into a keypad next to the door.
You open the door.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

02:02:44 You remove the 12:00 13/07 AEU space defense report from a brushed steel desk.

02:02:47 In addition, there appears to be some writing on the 12:00 13/07 AEU space defense report...

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:03:04 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:03:04 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

02:03:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ow well no ground combat warriors lately!"

02:03:08 I can't find "sofa."

02:03:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No beacons or such either."

02:03:22 I can't find "sofa."

02:03:23 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:03:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "We are a lazy lot!"

02:03:48 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:03:50 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:03:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We are."

02:03:54 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:13:28 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

02:13:48 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Hello."

02:14:06 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo."

02:15:05 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Sure, wont have much time, but we can do it."

02:15:09 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Either GMG or beacons, I'm down for either."

02:15:16 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire laughs. "Alright."

02:15:18 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:15:24 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Beacons."

02:15:28 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Chetumal in a few minutes?"

02:15:28 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Let's do beacons."

02:15:31 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Hey I'm already at old earth."

02:15:33 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:15:39 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Beacons are good."

02:15:44 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:15:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey."

02:15:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Hey lily."

02:15:52 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "We already have enough for stalwarts."

02:16:27 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Sorry I either wanted to do beacons or GMG, but if you don't have enough or a lot of time hakeem, we'd better wait till you do."

02:16:34 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright."

02:16:35 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Sure."

02:16:37 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Hey that was about 100 mil, not too bad!"

02:16:42 You grin.

02:16:45 Lily Kaise grins.

02:16:46 You say, "Nope, not bad at all."

02:16:54 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Beacons."

02:17:15 Lily says to you, "You up for beacons?"

02:18:01 "I actually do not have the energy for beacons today." You shake your head. "But you can go if you'd like."

02:18:41 Lily Kaise says, "Nope I'll stay back."

02:18:58 You say, "Ok."

02:19:01 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:20:20 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Nobody for beacons?"

02:20:43 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Can I engineer?"

02:20:49 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Yes."

02:20:54 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Can I get 2 gunners?"

02:21:28 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:21:29 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

02:23:28 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

02:33:22 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:33:27 Lily says to you, "So."

02:33:49 Lily Kaise asks, "I want to go see if the felo chow guy will sell me some chow now you ok to go along?"

02:34:07 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Hi."

02:34:13 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Hi you missed beacons."

02:34:17 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey alko."

02:34:18 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo."

02:34:23 [General Communication] Alko Delovega mumbles.

02:34:28 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "The next one."

02:35:16 Lily Kaise says, "Ok I'm going."

02:35:19 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:35:26 Lily Kaise removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

02:35:32 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I really need to find a use for that cruiser I got."

02:35:34 Lily Kaise puts a plain white spacesuit helmet in a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

02:35:40 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

02:35:43 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:35:44 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:35:52 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:35:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:35:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:36:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:36:11 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:36:13 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:36:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:36:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

02:36:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:36:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:36:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:36:21 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:36:22 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Mine has a lot of rooms, we can perhaps use them as hotels?"

02:36:24 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "William Dove, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

02:36:25 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Quantum Skim Accelerator to The Cross.

02:36:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:36:31 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Flying house."

02:36:34 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:36:40 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:36:43 I don't understand that.

02:36:46 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:36:47 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit 
02:36:47 aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

02:36:51 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:36:54 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:36:58 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:37:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:37:23 You feel the ship shudder slightly as it approaches a quantum skim accelerator.

02:37:27 The computer announces, "Initiating connection with The Cross's local quantum skim accelerator network."

02:37:52 The computer announces, "Connection established. Communicating between quantum skim acceleration gates now."

02:38:21 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I am sure that I will have a candy shop at some place inside my ship. Or maybe a place to sell chairs."

02:38:22 The computer announces, "Skim subroutine initializing in five seconds."

02:38:24 The computer announces, "Four."

02:38:24 The computer announces, "Three."

02:38:25 The computer announces, "Two."

02:38:26 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Woo."

02:38:27 The computer announces, "One."

02:38:28 The computer announces, "Skim subroutine initialized."

02:38:28 You feel the deck underneath you shudder violently, and you stumble slightly.

02:38:33 The shuddering finally settles down.

02:38:39 The computer announces, "Skim initialization complete."

02:39:09 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "You b(tter[start ,a%ing~"

02:39:15 [General Communication] Alko Delovega cackles!

02:39:25 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "U$n?"

02:40:33 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

18:37:57 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

19:25:41 You scramble to your feet.

19:25:42 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:25:42 You exit the ship.

19:25:42 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

19:25:44 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

19:25:45 You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:25:45 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

19:25:46 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

19:25:46 Board what?

19:25:47 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:25:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:25:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:25:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:25:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:25:59 The ship is already moving.

19:26:01 The ship is already moving.

19:26:02 The ship is already moving.

19:26:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:26:04 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Borderlands. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:26:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:26:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Borderlands."

19:26:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:26:09 The ship is already moving.

19:26:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:26:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:26:12 Once the frontier of Known Space for many years, the Borderlands region is now a settled area of space, though rather poor compared to most others. A handful of beacons indicate the positions of clouds of debris, but a nearby star indicates a solar system may also be in this cluster.
