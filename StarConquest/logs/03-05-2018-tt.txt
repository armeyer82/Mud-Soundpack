Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Star Conquest Help: Asteroid Mining
--
Category: Activities
--
As one of the few people ever to visit those asteroid outposts scattered
throughout deep space, starship pilots are able to assist with mining the
asteroids that are hauled in.
Each asteroid is sectioned off into several sites. You have control of one site
at a time. This site consists of buildings and automated drones. Your job is to
choose which buildings and drones to build, and to continue mining at your site
until all ore is retrieved. You may also 'research' new buildings by downloading
data from the asteroid outpost, although this will cost you some of your usable
metals. You are then compensated for your time depending on how efficiently you
turned the site's ore deposits into usable raw metals.
That part sounds simple enough. You should also be aware that there are less
scrupulous groups operating in and around asteroid outposts. These people,
rather than mining at their own site, will occasionally send poacher drones to
steal your own metals. Your drones will do their best to defend against this
automatically, but you should ensure your site's security by placing defensive
buildings to protect your own site's metal.
Note: It is not necessary to destroy buildings to reclaim their metals prior to
ending your site. This is taken into account automatically.
How To Begin
Travel to any space station that accepts hauled asteroids. Find this location's
asteroid mining operations room. Type START to begin.
Warning: Starting and cancelling mining sites in quick succession will give you
lower and lower quality sites. For best results, complete the site you are given
every time.
How To Control Your Site
You may continue to stand in the operations room and type commands to operate
your site. You may also enter a virtual representation of your site using the
ENTER command and walk around to observe what is happening. (Note: Players using
screen readers will probably find the virtual representation option easier.)
List of Commands
START: Assigns a mining site to you and allows you to begin operations.
MAP: Look at an overview of your mining site.
STATUS: A general report of your site's resources.
SUMMARY: A more extensive summary of your progress.
METALS/ORE: Individually display amount of resource on your site.
DRONES: See what your drones are doing.
BUILDINGS: See what you've built and where your buildings are.
ENTER Enter a virtual representation of your mining site. It may also be
followed by coordinates to enter at that location.
EXIT: Exit the virtual representation.
BUILD: Order the construction of a new building.
RESEARCH: Request data about new buildings from the outpost.
ORDER: Order new drones built, or existing drones upgraded.
DESTROY: Destroy an existing building and reclaim some of the metals used in its
construction.
TASKS: Decide which types of drones do which kinds of tasks.
END: End operations on your site and collect compensation (if your work so far
deserves any).
CHANNEL or C [message]: Communicate with others running mining sites.
LICENSE: Upgrades your mining license at higher levels of industry points,
gaining you access to higher quality, better paying asteroids.
UPGRADE: Improves specific aspects of your mining site. Any purchased upgrades
will apply for all future sites.
DISPLAY: Toggles whether the semi-graphical map is displayed while building.
Special Asteroids
Most asteroids are classified as the "rocky" type. Once you have a mining
license, you will occasionally be offered the opportunity to process more
unusual asteroids.
* Metal-rich: These asteroids simply have more ore to process, and are a much
bigger target for poachers.
* Comet: On comets, you may extract water ice for a boost to your payout. Ice is
extracted using separate ice mining buildings, but the ice does not require
processing.
* Radioactive: The third tier processors and higher will be able to extract
radioactives as well as metal from your ore, boosting your payout. To support
the power requirements of these advanced processors, radioisotope thermoelectric
generators will be available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

alright, how about you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Not bad, just had a
short nap...time to crack the whip again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm doing a spot
of mining myself."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Reckon I'm going to
find me some good astroids to salvage."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi Alistair, currently,
the best place to mine is in the Frontier Cluster."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "At some point I
want to check out some good trading routes as well!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never tried
trading. I think Ather knows a fair bit about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Thanks lilly, I'll
check it out, is that where there are usually bari?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though, our poor
relations with the League and Mutuality will limit our route options, I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes Ather is our
Trading pro."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "It just doesn't
seem the time for it! Especially with the outsiders surrounding us...polotics
annoy me!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It's going to be a bit
difficult to get a lot of trading done though because we can't trade with
Mutuality or more than likely with League since we have no diplomatic relations
with either of those alliances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I sometimes wish
that those in power would strong arm the diplomacy a little, but then I can
sometr salvage it is then, we can't be out of the loop forever. It'll hopefully
turn around."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Sorry mis comm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I meantr we will
get there eventually, well hopefully."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure
what can be done presently. The mutuality just straight up doesn't like us. I
don't really see them considering any offer we can realistically make them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "You certainly can
salvage, asteroid haul or do beacon drops as we have stations of our own. Just
look at the messages on your communicator from time to time because I have been
building those stations for us to use in our sectors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I think the
league won't make amends with us until the mutuality okays it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is so
hilarious and so, so League."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah but are we
forgetting the history with the outsiders?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Damn it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
unfortunately some have forgotten."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Best for one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Even though it
wasn't that long ago."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I don't know
what's up with his memory."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It has nothing to do
with Outsiders but with the AEU current government and past transgressions on
the part of AEU pilots themselves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Can we be
completely sure of no influence though?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Influence of
what?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No but our lack of
relations isn't related to that aspect."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it ties
into it somewhat. Part of the reason we left the Accord is that our government
no longer believes the Outsiders are enough of a threat to contribute resources
to defend against."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And the league
can say what it wants, but they dissolved the nonaggression pact after we left
the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Didn't the
mutuality send some kind of diplomatic ambassador recently? I thought there was
a message on the boards about it, in the conference room?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We sent envoys
to them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The negotiations
broke down quickly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was voice at
the time and kept a bunch of records about it, if you're ever interested in
reading them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They're not
really that great, but it does provide an insight into what the mutuality thinks
of us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not much, that
is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah I would really
like a copy of those."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I mean a copy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, next
time I'm on New Earth I'll get you one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah that would be
appreciated."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Do you think my
latest run in with pirates might be related to the situation? I mean will it
mean more pirate activity?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unregs dislike
the union in particular for many reasons, but pirates sort of prey on
everybody."
[Tactical Communication] Breton Ormarr transmits, "D-04 rats in coming i'm
dealing with them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it was
probably unrelated."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The league and
the merry band don't fight one another now, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So the merry
band may be strengthened by that in general over time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Hmmmm...sounds like
I need to polish my waning combat skills."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good idea!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you've never
flown a beacon by yourself, I recommend checking out the simulators at Accord
command."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't go
today, but if you want someone to show you, I can show you tomorrow. Also Shule
and Ather are both much better teachers of combat piloting than me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So if you can
get one of them, all the better."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But no harm in
trying the simulator yourself, there's nothing to lose but a little time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah I will do, I'm
just about surviving miners and fighters at the moment, but anything more tough
and I'd be space debris."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Thanks for the
suggestion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Pirate activity is an
ongoing thing Alistair. I have experieenced encounters with Pirates and Ifs
since I became a pilot over 4 years ago."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "When we can, we
actually do engage them but there haven't been many of us at work lately. It's
great fun!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah I'd like to
kick their ass!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I normally
just avoid them now, but for a while I tried to disrupt them whenever I saw
them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You have to
imagine every chunk we let them salvage will somehow lead to them invading us
later."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Through using
the resources or selling them, or whatever."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The transports
look harmless but they're constantly waging a war against us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well hopefully we can
all get together on some of that activity. As I say, we're just at work
infrequently tehse days."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "These days."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Should I drop my
salvage at steeSteel Pheonix?l."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Steel Pheonix?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes please."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "No problem, the
extra creds definetly supports my fun."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[Tactical Communication] Breton Ormarr transmits, "Anyone going to run beacons
before end of conquest?"
[Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Most likely, no guarantees
though."
[Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "I did all mine. Nests
though on the other hand."
[Tactical Communication] Breton Ormarr transmits, "Yeah I could do with nests
to, but no mule."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person
cargo hauler "Long Haul". The organization has earned 214,513.67 credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Thanks for the tip
lilly, good payout."

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.
