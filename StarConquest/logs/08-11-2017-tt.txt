curtains, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Ameliorate Space Center; Main Deck; Outside Astral Accents Kiosk]
The main deck of the Ameliorate Space Center is constructed in the style of a
massive open air bazaar with kiosks scattered across the open floor rather than
enclosed structures or rooms. The entire deck is built within a massive
transparisteel bubble in the heart of the space station, suspended in the midst
of clear deep blue water supporting an amazing coral reef habitat. The domed
roof and arching walls curve seamlessly into the transparent floor, lending a
feeling of total submersion to visitors. A bewildering variety of fish,
crustaceans and cephalopods immerse themselves in a dazzling array of ocean
flora while the sleek and fleeting forms of sharks glide through the expanses of
open water around you. The deck appears to be lit by brilliant light globes in
the outer skin of the station which results in rippling blue light flooding the
enclosure. A variety of potted ferns and flowering plants bathed beneath small
individual sun lamps are scattered around the deck creating clear islands of
light. Park-style benches can also be spotted around the deck.

The scent of strawberry suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from
somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  A standalone starmap viewer
appears to be installed here.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
fuchsia status.  Glancing at the rose-tinted windows flanked by sheer gold
curtains, you notice solid hull plates are shielding them externally, blocking
all view of the outside.
