Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

pa Dumping debris.
You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Dumping debris."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
^4$'\Nzoo_yBC7"lEd)i3C9W%;a|Rd<BD;~o9#dt
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, if
she's got a good of head on her shoulders as you do, we'll be in good shape."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "We butt heads a lot
but she'll do good, im sure of it.. im suprised that she did make the decision
to be a pilot though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, if you
two are close, maybe she just idn't want to be away from her sister. It can be
hard on folks who still have family that they can't go visit without special
approval."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, right.
You guys can't hear me shrug."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Huh? We can't?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na,
not without occasional planetary visitation passes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Unless they
live in an already approved city, like New Phoenix."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Depending on where you lived, the alliance won't le tyou revisit that area
except by special request. It's cause of all the credits that we make. We stand
to do a lot of single-handed damage to any city's economy if we were able to
just go anywhere we pleased."

Ather crash economies just by getting off the hoverbus."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well ok, me
too. And you too one day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"There's Jack town too, don't forget jachey, I only have 37 billion credits and
change. Why don't you fucking ask someone like Lily how many credits they have?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Lily has more
credits than you? Damn."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily
has like 5 times the credits I have."
[General Communication] Eli transmits the sound of coughing and spluttering.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But
don't forget, Lily hasn't lost like 8 cruisers in defense of the alliance.
Shitload of pulsars, fucking goodness knows how many smaller ships."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I hit the
wrong button.. oh my god."

almost literally all she does is like mine and shit."

credit?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thirty four million?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's
insane, I bet your net worth is more though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep,
1 credit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's 34
million in like what, two days?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na,
she's still got me on networth. Especially since my house isn't counted towards
it yet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not to
mention how much you've probably spent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I also spent 25
million earlier, Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, Ather I
was thinking of your house."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like
I said, Eli. She doesn't spend a vast majority of he rcredits. She rarely to
never flies major beacon drops and the like that I've seen. Heck, I don't ever
think I've seen her pilot in y life."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
spent 25 million on...breakfast!"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep.. I've
said it hundred times, my dad would have a fit if he knew how many credits I
just toss around on a whim."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Laugh
right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What? I can't
hear anything now, it's just all ringing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Laugh

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And possibly
good practice?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Probably!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn't even
realize I was on the pad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
weren't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok. Just
that robot intuition, huh?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
took an educated guess, transported the right ship because I figured I know you
so well, and my gamble paid off. I'm not really that new at the game of careful
tactical thinking, you know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

apart more dead bari spreaders. Ugh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww, tara, we
didn't scare off your sister, did we?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nah, probably not!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah ok good.
We're just kiddin around."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey Ather?
What the hell is this switch that toggles off sensor interpretations?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sensor interpretations
?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, the
switch is just labled reports, but that's apparently what it does. But I
honestly have no idea what that actually means."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's a toggle
and it says "report sensor interpretations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, it would
help if he was still on comms."

just what we've been missing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Here I thought it

good to get some new pilots. I feel like we've been in a major dry spell."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone sighs.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But what a
bore."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How are you?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not even a hello when
you walked passed? I'll so remember that."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What?!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where did I pass you."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You're worried about a

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", a wormhole drive

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that
bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed
with bright white floodlights.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored
in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation
order is entered."
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm!

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
A small but very serious-looking space station floats here, brightly lit and
made from silvery reflective metal. A large docking bay holds rows of fighters
ready to scramble, with visitors' ships parked deeper inside. A secondary bay
sees steady activity from small rapid deployment shuttles. Painted in bright red
on various parts of the station are the letters "SVP."
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to Space Vermin Patrol Command in thirty seconds unless aborted or

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are
landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone
here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
`pq=-L!r(*co$urr]9V}ncH}SWj/feZ2b2OF[(Zx
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits,
"Current riftflow conditions are 2455 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Northwest and Slightly Up."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey! Luja!"
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Hello!"
[MTTS] Ulias: Did you guys do away with the regular citizen player system?
[MTTS] Ulias: Or do just folks never use that.
[MTTS] Squidmind: We eventually discontinued it due to the amount of effort each
individual non-pilot required, combined with the fact that every non-pilot
rerolled extremely quickly due to not being able to engage with the game to the
same level as standard pilot players.
[MTTS] Ulias: Ah, yeah that makes sense I suppose. I'm not sure I could have
done it myself, but it always seemed like a good option for hardcore
roleplayers.
[MTTS] Squidmind: I think we had maybe six or seven non-pilots while the option
was available?  A couple of them did pretty well, but you could see them
gradually get disheartened with all the 'anyone want to do a beacon?'  "I'd love
to, but..." and having to ask for lifts to get to other planets.
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "What's an artifact repository
drone for~CB~8B."
[MTTS] Ulias: Would have been kinda neat if we could have had one of each, but
that would have clearly lead to meta shenanigans.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can bolt it, and
put a xenology container inside. Then when you drop an artifact, it will
automatically place it into the container for you."
[MTTS] usfolks: I can so see that as a disaster waiting to happen.
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Ah, I see."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I don't see a point."
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Me neither."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's only a mild
time-saver, but I've always really liked mine."
[MTTS] Squidmind: If we had unlimited time and energy to create stuff for a
non-pilot, sure.  But each non-pilot was basically a permanent never-ending
policy 14 event for that person, which was the second major reason we
discontinued it.  We had to put a lot of effort into building, coding, and
fluff, in order to have a non-pilot function in any usable way.
[MTTS] Ulias: Oh yeah, wow. I didn't think about that.
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "It would be cooler if he go
pick them from spae."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Space?"
[General Communication] Alko Delovega laughs.
[MTTS] usfolks: When I was new, I thought most of the staff-played NPC's were
special application non-pilot characters. Gotta love the naivete of new players.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've never tested it,
but I've often wondered if you can put different containers in them, and have it
seperate them into the proper containers based on who is dropping it, that might
be kinda nice. Though the times when two people need to deposit an artifact at
the same time are basically non-existant as far as I know."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I don't see anything wrong
with the way we are doing it now, not even slow."
[MTTS] Squidmind: I'm not sure whether we should take that as a compliment or
not.
[MTTS] Ulias: Hahaha.
[MTTS] usfolks: Heh. It was not meant in a negative way at all. Just my total
lack of knowledge when I started playing.
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Someone has to go with me
GMG!"
[MTTS] Ulias: I love interacting with NPC's It's one of the things that sets SC
apart from everything else in my opinion. Writing letters and all that, if they
don't get responded to. It's a level that won't be achieved in regular games
until they create Diamond Age style games, with dedicated actors.
[MTTS] Ulias: Even if they don't get responded to, rather.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Keep in mind that it's easy for us to miss letters, so if you
want to ensure we notice, a support ticket is useful.
[MTTS] Ulias: I can't just tell the liaison? Aren't they mailmen?
[MTTS] Ulias: Hehehe.
[MTTS] Squidmind: You can tell the Voice if you like. I'm sure none of them have
any other pressing issues right now!
[MTTS] Ulias: I'll keep that in mind though, I just always thought of it as I'm
writing someone who is very busy and doesn't have time to respond to every
letter that's sent by a civilian pilot asking about quotes and advice.
[MTTS] usfolks: Gee...I'm trying to keep the house quiet and about busted out
laughing. good one.
[MTTS] usfolks: Me too Ulias.
[MTTS] Squidmind: That's a good reason, but that also applies to us OOCly as
well!
[MTTS] Squidmind: Well, less 'doesn't have time to' and more 'is busy and will
miss them', since we don't get the benefit of a physical thing being dumped on a
desk.
[MTTS] usfolks: You mean...the Squidmind has a life? Or...lives? Tell me it
ain't so!
[MTTS] Squidmind: The Squidmind is eternal.
[MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, I can imagine it would be a pain to check every NPc's
mailbox, there's a ton of them.
[MTTS] Ulias: Even with some system that dumps them all together, it's probably
a lot.
[MTTS] usfolks: I meant a life outside of SC. And that does clear something up
for me. I kind of figured you got mail notifications or something, but it makes
sense you don't.
[MTTS] usfolks: That they'd all end up in a bin in the host lounge or something.
[MTTS] Squidmind: We do have things that simplify it, but you're correct that
there are a LOT of NPCs.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah. I'll have to remember the support thing next time. I kind
of did that once...but probably should have included the letter or something. It
still went well though. You guys do awesome things.
[MTTS] Squidmind: There are approximately 200 NPCs. That may not cover all of
them, either.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, that's a lot to keep track of. Now...let me get that NPC's
list and write unique letters to every single one just because...no don't hurt
me I'm joking.
[MTTS] usfolks: Heh.
[MTTS] Ulias: Good lord, 200? That's even more than I imagined, certainly more
than the help files suggest, though I'm sure this is because many of them don't
have mailboxes.
[MTTS] Ulias: What do you mean I can't send a letter to Granny Tang?
[MTTS] usfolks: Oh lord, that probably means you tried...
[MTTS] Ulias: No I actually didn't, though I have tried ones like that before.
[MTTS] usfolks: Aha.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Every NPC that exists as an entity has a mailbox.  That 200
are only the ones who actually exist in-game as characters.
[MTTS] Squidmind: God knows how many 'NPCs' we've named who DON'T have
characters.
[MTTS] Ulias: Oh wow, so was totally wrong about that. That's awesome.
[MTTS] usfolks: I'm sure that would multiply it several times at least.
[MTTS] Ulias: Didn't I hear you guys say once, that ships like pirate ships
actually have NPC's in them crewing?
[MTTS] Ulias: Always thought that was a wicked concept.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Sort of, but they're not characters if that's what you mean.
[MTTS] usfolks: Are they similar to the automated NPC's like the cadet
orientation officers and things?
[MTTS] Ulias: No no, Ijust meant that the ships are not empty.
[MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, like what they said.
[MTTS] Squidmind: They're entities that exist, yes.  They're just not named.
[MTTS] usfolks: A pilot, a gunner...
[MTTS] Ulias: That's so cool.
[MTTS] usfolks: It is.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Of course that's only for the generic AI ships, in some cases
they are manned by NPCs.
[MTTS] usfolks: Well that would make sense. And would be how some of the
plotlines have been possible.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Plotlines? In our game? I'LL PUT A STOP TO THAT!
[MTTS] usfolks: Please don't!
[MTTS] usfolks: That's one of the things that makes SC special. You don't just
do invasions as events...there are actual plotlines.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Now there's an idea.  A weekly massive invasion instead of
plots.  That'd make things much easier.  Thanks for the suggestion!
[MTTS] usfolks: Oh lord...
[MTTS] Ulias: Specifically host run plotlines, and not just player created ones.
So many of these text based RPG's depend on their players to do almost
everything.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah...only staff involvement you get is invasions where players
are required to participate.
[MTTS] Squidmind: We like when players do things, too.  We just want them to let
us know they're doing it, because like with the mail thing we don't always catch
stuff.
[MTTS] Ulias: I'm particularly a big fan of outside interference evetns. Random
game spicer-upper? Toggle on please.
[MTTS] usfolks: Understandable. And yeah, me too Ulias. It was one of the first
things I did in my character's settings.
[MTTS] usfolks: Those have been some of my most treasured times in this
game...when random things just happen out of the blue.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Ha ha... blue!
[MTTS] Squidmind: Oh wait, wrong person.
[MTTS] usfolks: Heh. Heh. Heh.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's
chair, and a black leather sofa here.
You can go south and out.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Nest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, one thing
we do is clear out RATs nests."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "All right, there

said, Fringe is a damage suit. The AEU suit repairs and also can be used to stun
or interrupt the enemy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are also
some other suits that sort of combine roles, but those are the three basic
ones."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Is there a button
inside this suit that will repair it? Or must I simply wait?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They do repair
themselves slowly over time."

suit repair more with a minor repair than the league suit with armor that used a
major repair."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting.
I was about to ask if armor did that to every suit's repair capabilities."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That makes
sense."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
6is]|^\YQ@qCzO2/-A!8e4E_efxuZ~)>Ye-|m/O&
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well easy way to sort this."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Because if the 285
accelerator is down...that could cause issues. accept that I wasn't given that
to build, and I can't use a constructor, even if I was. It's probably on the
seekers ship."
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits,
"Current riftflow conditions are 2203 light-minutes per second from Galactic

the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit"
You see a scout here.
"Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" is written along its hull in flaming neon yellow letters.
The designation "FS-28-101" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a neon purple color with neon green trim.
Its laser turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in neon yellow.
The bays of its torpedo launchers are oiled to perfection and painted neon
yellow. Its landing struts are slightly rusty and painted neon green.
It has a racing stripe forward on the starboard side, a racing stripe forward on
the port side, a Fringe logo on the forward end, a stylized Jinu decal near the
hatch, a tailfin on the rearward end, and a complicated anchor assembly on the
underside.

[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Likewise."

You say, OOCly, "No problem."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I would say you either think Best is
terrible or you do not. It is a black and white issue for me."

[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "There are choices people make which
are irredeemable and despite any other actions they may take, they will never
overcome those choices."

shit ton of work into this game. And we really do appreciate it.
Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Things aren't so easy when
you're living under a regime you don't entirely agree with. You have to be

Lexie Amarras says, "Well I'm sure the mutuality folks have a different
perspective, they can always load on a ship and go to another station, or just
fly out a few light years."
[MTTS] something: Hey, now I feel less crazy. I did that too.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Thanks!
[MTTS] Butchulla: On the critter topic, I really love the detail you guys have
gone into with every kind of animal. They really are one of the joys of this
game. I mean, even including fish death, and seeing it happen...Much respect
goes to you guys for all of that code. I'm glad it wasn't me, coding all that.
Lexie Amarras says, "Makes for a different style of politics."
[MTTS] something: Seconded.
nod lexie 'Exactly
You nod to Lexie Amarras. "Exactly."
Lexie Amarras says, "The one thing that I think many people don't realize is
that all three of our governments run on something of a similar principle, we
have an illusion of democracy, but the big boys and girls at the top wield much
more power than they probably should."
[MTTS] usfolks: Agreed. I guess sometimes I wonder if you guys know how much we
do appreciate what you do. So...we do!
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "People must make a stand against
such things. Failure to do so will only entrench the regime. Risks are
dangerous, to be sure. But without risk you have no reward and no hope at all."

awesome, and you guys rock.

one's stands in various ways, and sometimes the best way is to infiltrate. Not
saying that's what happened here, but until I know more, I won't rule it out."
[MTTS] usfolks: It's not ego. They do a lot of work...so that we have this game
that so many of us enjoy. They deserve a thank you from time to time.

other alliances have not taken more vocal stand against AEU leaving Accord."

trade. Sanctions. Make it hurt."

You smile at Lexie Amarras.
Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I agree Aisling, I was very
vocal in the League hate on Vernos meeting to that effect. My point was that
whether or not Vernos was at fault, we needed to try and force our own
governments to make a stronger stand against the AEu's actions."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Alliances have power to do this but
they seem content to let them do this alone."

You say, "Sorry."
Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That was the concensus, but if
we feel strongly about something we should act accordingly, pain and risk as
Aisling said earlier are part of standing up for what's right."
Lexie Amarras says, "I"m trying to wax philosophical hard to do that while I"m
giggling in my com."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "AEU pilots are in this mess because
of own selfishness as it is."
Lexie Amarras grins at you.
'True, but it's fun to watch you try.
You say, "True, but it's fun to watch you try."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Voted for Best by and large to
ensure they could just stay pilots and ignored his rhetoric."
Lexie Amarras laughs.
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "All they cared about was continuing
to be pilots."
Lexie Amarras says, "A little extremist, maybe Nina Thomas should recruit her as
a public spokesman."

You chuckle.
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "So now the time has come to make it
right. If that means some suffering, so be it. Or will you again take the easy
path?"
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "The one which is most convenient for
you."

changelog
Recent Minor Changes:
-----
Inactive orgs will no longer show up on the menu in mess halls.
   Posted 5 days, 16 hours, 48 minutes, and 6 seconds ago
-----
Whether people are jostled in crowded control rooms now has more to do with who
has actually recently been near the controls, though larger groups of people
will continue to be an inconvenience regardless, depending on the size of the
ship. Also, more commands will potentially result in jostling.
This means that, for example, a fighter cockpit becomes crowded very easily.
However, a handful of people in the control room of a large ship will not cause
issues unless multiple people are actually reaching for the controls around the
same time.
   Posted 3 days, 1 hour, 9 minutes, and 41 seconds ago
-----
The commands RIFT STATUS and RIFT LOCATIONS will no longer provoke jostling.
   Posted 20 hours, 12 minutes, and 40 seconds ago
-----
People who were troubled by the knowledge of exactly what debris was being
expelled can now breathe a little easier; this information is now obscured if
you are not in the control room.
   Posted 20 hours, 5 minutes, and 25 seconds ago
-----
ArachnoPals should now be smart enough to remember where their food is.
   Posted 52 minutes and 17 seconds ago

A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off. Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received. Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection."
You suddenly float up into the air as the ship's artificial gravity abruptly
switches off, and you feel your hair stand on end as the ship projects an
electromagnetic field around you. Suddenly, every seam of the ship seems to come
apart, exposing you to space. You quickly close your eyes as the vacuum pulls at
your skin and the electromagnetic field tugs you rapidly toward a starship
rescue pod.

This pod is rather cramped quarters, consisting of a circle of seats with
harnesses to secure the occupants. Space is saved by the almost total lack of
any sort of flight control whatsoever, although a tiny starmap display and a
very few other status readouts are available. Equipment thrums under your feet,
where the flight computer and the pod's various drives are housed. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space. The hatch appears to be locked.

Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

NEW EARTH (OMEGA V)
Year of Discovery: 2142
Year of Colonisation: 2157
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 10 billion
Primary Orbit: Omega
Important Locations: New Phoenix, Landfall, Velouria, Christabel Mountains,
Encatan Peninsula, Mount Trifad
Unusually for the First Great Colonisation Rush, New Earth's first city was not
named after its colony ship, the Intrepid.  Instead, after landing at dawn the
captain called the sunrise over the highest peak of Christabel mountain 'a
phoenix', and thus the first town became known as New Phoenix.  Notable families
in this initial wave of colonisation were members of the Mendes Syndicate, the
Shetland family, and a collective of African Nationalists.  Many of the early
colony ships contained vastly wealthy families or individuals, especially
entrepreneurs who wanted to take their chances on a new world; as such New Earth
(as one of the few surviving original colonies) became a planet filled with the
super-rich, assisted by the eventual worldwide depression back on what became
Old Earth.  In the wake of that depression and subsequent communications
blackout, New Earth reached out to the other newly formed colonies and the few
who reached back joined with it to form what is now the Alliance of ExtraSolar
Unions.  In the years after the construction of New Phoenix, a small town grew
up around the remnants of the Intrepid some fifty kilometers from New Phoenix
that would eventually name itself Landfall.
Notable Life:
Omega V has a rich variety of life, though recent events have changed some
elements of this.
The velourian sparklehawk (a bird-like creature native to the forest regions on
the coast of the Velourian sea), the phoenician boar (a rodent/boar creature
about a meter long native to the plains surrounding New Phoenix), and the pellis
mermaid (a predatory pseudosimian that hid in the shallows of rivers and ponds
much like a crocodile or the predecessors of whales and dolphins), are now
considered extinct in the wild after the accidental introduction to the New
Earth ecosystem of the xenological superpredator known as felo.  
The carnivorous plants known as nepenthes mobilis or the mobile pitcher plant
are endemic to Mt. Trifad and the surrounding jungles; usually easily avoided
due to their vibrant colouration but dangerous to the unwary who see the pretty
flowers and take a closer look - their projectile hooked stings can paralyse in
seconds and slowly drag even a human into their large urn-like pitchers, while
the vast quantities of digestive enzymes within said pitchers cause third degree
burns within minutes. They are capable of locomotion up to 4 kilometers per
hour, but if they find no prey they must regularly root themselves to absorb
nutrients from soil. 
The encatan megahornet is a large venomous insect that can grow up to a foot
long, originally discovered on the Encatan peninsula but variants are known to
exist across most of the temperate regions of the planet. While highly
dangerous, megahornets tend to avoid building nests near to human settlements.

TELEX
Year of Discovery: 2144
Year of Colonisation: 2159
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 8 billion
Primary Orbit: Omega
Important Locations: New Roanoke, Providence, Nature Preserve, The Heartwood
Forests
Telex was colonised by the colony ship Roanoke, with the town of New Roanoke
being formed after it was dismantled.  Primarily American colonists were on
board the Roanoke, and they took to the new world by looking back in history -
to the wild west.  Much of the early settlers, with the aid of advanced
technology, treated Telex as if it were the frontier of the old west back on Old
Earth.  With the discovery of the gargantuan heartwood trees a divide began
between those who wanted to remain close to their roots (no pun intended) and
those who felt that they could use the heartwoods as the basis for canopy
colonies, the first of which became Providence.
Notable Life: 
The Heartwood is a massive tree, dwarfing even the giant redwoods from Old Earth
and its forests cover much of the southern hemisphere.  Entire unique ecosystems
exist within their roots, their branches and even within the heartwood trunks
themselves. After the creation of the canopy town of Providence, the human
colonists began to create their own habitation within the great trees.
One of the reasons that the 'wild west' attitude became such a common element
for Telexans was the discovery of the auroch.  Named after the ancient forebear
of the cow, the auroch is a pseudobovine native to the Telexan plains. Standing
two meters tall on average but incredibly docile, the aurochs travel in vast
herds of thousands, but were quickly domesticated and corralled to farm them by
the first settlers.  After careful examination to prove their meat and milk were
not harmful, the auroch became a staple of the Telexan diet since even a single
auroch could feed a family for a week.  Today, aurochs can be found in many
meat-farms across the Union, but millions of herds still roam free across the
plains of Telex.

ZION
Year of Discovery: 2144
Year of Colonisation: 2159
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 1 billion
Primary Orbit: Omega IV
Important Locations: Zion Sublunar Habitation Network, Zion Publishing HQ
Zion is in actuality a small moon orbiting the gas giant Omega IV as opposed to
an actual planet.  The Roanoke's sister ship Zion landed on what was at the time
known only as Omega IVa and the moon was named for the colony ship.  With the
surface uninhabitable, the colonists attempted an experiment - an entirely
subterranean existence. The colony itself is not multiple towns or cities, but a
single massive cave and tunnel network that weaves paths kilometers below the
crust.  Its atmosphere is entirely generated by massive machines at the core of
the moon.
Notable Life:
Being an airless moon, Zion has no native life. All life forms in the Zion
sublunar habitat caverns are Earth-stock, but many have begun to evolve to adapt
to their new environs.

HYPERION
Year of Discovery: 2147
Year of Colonisation: 2162
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 8 billion
Primary Orbit: Cheyanne's Star
Important Locations: Avalon, The Sea of Grass, Jacktown, The Felo Sanctuary
The colony ship Avalon was sent to Cheyanne's Star as part of the first Great
Colonisation Rush along with its sister ships the Iram and Shangri-La.  As with
the other successful colonies the starship was dismantled on Hyperion to create
the first city at its landing site.  Shortly after the creation of the town of
Avalon a group of survivalists and wilderness experts led by one Jack McIntyre
headed out into the untamed lands to forge their own path, creating Jacktown in
honour of their leader.  This spirit of adventure led to the primary spaceport
of Hyperion being constructed just outside Jacktown while Avalon, lying a few
dozen kilometers away, remains starship-free to this day.
Notable Life: 
Of the life on Hyperion, two species enjoy widespread notoriety. 
First is the black rautine, a pseudoavian species popularized by stories of
their rare attacks on humans, similar to how the great white shark was known to
pre-Diaspora humans despite the vast unlikelihood of ever being harmed by one. A
single rautine is an unassuming beast: a small four-winged birdlike creature,
though with a razor-sharp beak. However, rautines exist in vast swarms and make
their homes in very large communal nests assembled from blades of grass. They
may earn their name partly from the fact that particularly large flocks of them
have been known to darken the sun. A black rautine on its own quickly dies; they
act as a social organism not unlike ants and bees, divided into castes of
scouts, hunters, nest-tenders, and breeders. Rautines are insatiable omnivores
and can quickly strip an area of all edible material whether vegetable, animal,
or in rare cases, human. Despite being voracious eaters, however, they avoid the
unfamiliar and usually steer clear of humans and their settlements, but an
unlucky person who accidentally disturbs a black rautine nest is in for a
harrowing, if not deadly, experience.
The other well-known species of Hyperion is rather more prosaic though, in
practical terms, far more deadly. Hyperion seagrass is not found in water;
rather, the grass itself is said to form a sea. The blue-green blades of grass
cover thousands upon thousands of square miles and are easily seen from space.
The "depth" of the Sea of Grass ranges from the height of a man to perhaps twice
or thrice that in the middle of Hyperion's many vast rolling plains. Within the
Sea of Grass, everything is obscured save for the sun when directly overhead,
making finding one's way without assistance nearly impossible. The animals that
live in the Sea of Grass are believed to be attuned to Hyperion's magnetic field
for the purposes of navigation. Predators are especially able to take advantage
of the obscuring grass, and can pounce upon the unwary with no warning
whatsoever. However, most who become lost in the Sea of Grass simply wander
until exposure or dehydration claim them.

ENDYMION
Year of Discovery: 2147
Year of Colonisation: 2162
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 6 billion
Primary Orbit: Cheyanne's Star
Important Locations: Iram, Lut-Kavir, Margo Kara, Taklama, Northern Ryn
The colony ship Iram reached Cheyanne's Star with its sister ships the Avalon
and Shangri-La during the first Great Colonisation Rush.  Bayendar landed on
Endymion, discovering an arid, desert world with thin temperate regions near the
poles.  While the colony ship was dismantled at one of these regions to form the
first city, the colonists spread outward and worked hard to find oases in the
deep desert that covered most of the world.
Notable Life:
While a desert world, Endymion does possess native life.  
The neo-thylacine is a lithe nocturnal pseudomammal that stays near an oasis in
their territory and hunts for smaller prey when they approach to drink.  In the
deep continental deserts, spotting a neo-thylacine is often seen as a sign of
good luck, as it shows you are near to an oasis or source of water and life.
A harmless animal that nonetheless has an undeserved reputation for danger and
terrifying people is the jba fofi, known colloquially as the nightmare spider. 
Possessing ten spindly limbs that can be up to a meter long and a body that can
be just as wide, the jba fofi is a sandy-coloured pseudoarachnid that hides in
the desert sands to wait for small creatures to pass by close enough to snatch,
akin to the sand spiders of Old Earth. However, jbo fofi avoid larger creatures
and when disturbed by something such as a human it will leap out of the sand in
an attempt to escape, but doing so can often be surprising for the wayward human
as the two-meter large alien spider appears from nowhere.

AENEA
Year of Discovery: 2147
Year of Colonisation: 2162
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 5 billion
Primary Orbit: Cheyanne's Star
Important Locations: Shangri-La Habitat, Personal Envirodomes
The Shangri-La was the third of the trio of colony ships travelling to
Cheyanne's Star alongide its sister ships the Avalon and Iram.  Discovering
Aenea was an airless world, the colonists within the ship saw this as a
challenge - creating self-sufficient environment domes and habitats that would
allow them to enjoy the majesty of this unique world without having to terraform
it and lose its natural charm.  Vast landscapes of blue-grey rocks and silver
skies create a beautiful, if deadly, environment.
Notable Life:
Aenea is naturally lifeless; the only living creatures are Earth-stock brought
by the colonists and living in their farm and hydroponics domes.
--
BIKURA
Year of Discovery: 2143
Year of Colonisation: 2158
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 6 billion
Primary Orbit: Riverway C
Important Locations: Samsara, Moksha, Kashi, Canyon Village
The colony ship Samsara was the ship that arrived at Bikura, a hot rocky world. 
The colonists dismantled the ship and created the town of Samsara in the
northern temperate regions, but eventually a larger city that became known as
Moksha became the capital in the rocky desert.  The primary spaceport was
constructed a few kilometers outside the city of Moksha, where Canyon Village
slowly formed around it.
Notable Life:
Bikura is not home to much life, but such native life that is well-known tend to
be reptilian.
The greater desert basilisk is a half-meter long pseudoreptile that can spit
venom up to thirty meters in order to stun its prey, and able to run at almost
30 kilometers an hour for short distances. 
On the other side of the spectrum is the sunrock salamander, a three meter long
behemoth of a pseudoreptile that has a body temperature of almost eighty degrees
Celsius which it can raise higher for short periods in order to burn an attacker
that attempts to grasp its scales, and also possesses glands that allow it to
produce a gelling agent which, when combined with its blood, form sticky
globules that burst into flame upon contact with something solid.  Luckily,
these creatures reside only in the hottest and brightest regions of the rocky
desert and flee from human activity.

HOYT
Year of Discovery: 2143
Year of Colonisation: N/A
Colonised by: N/A
Population (approximate): 5
Primary Orbit: Bikura
Important Locations: Hoyt Spaceport, Hoyt Repair & Rearm
An airless, lifeless, dead world.  Hoyt is not a colony, but an industrial moon
where there is little in the way of habitation.

DURE
Year of Discovery: 2143
Year of Colonisation: N/A
Colonised by: N/A
Population (approximate): 23
Primary Orbit: Bikura
Important Locations: Corbin Memorial Prison
An airless, lifeless, dead world.  Dure is not a colony; instead being used by
the Union (and the other alliances) as a prison planet for civilian pilots and
others.

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole
drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, and a fuzzy stuffed bear here.
You can go south and out.

[MTTS] Ulias: Wow, I could have sworn I was told a long time ago that rautines
were enormous, the mounted rautine head that's sold on SSN seems to back this
up. Thought they were like a slightly smaller version of rocs, I believe that's
how it ws put ot me before.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

Saira Sorrenson
She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has sun-kissed tawny skin. Her body is delicate with sensually curved hips and
shapely calves. She has lissome shoulders and pert breasts. Her face is
symmetrically ovular and high cheekboned, with an aquiline nose and gently
rounded chin. Her lips are full and pomegranate red and occasionally part to
reveal a set of even, white teeth. Beneath a set of gracefully arched eyebrows,
her eyes are slate blue and heavy-lidded. Her waist-length, silky hair is russet
and teased into loosely flowing waves down her back. She has meticulously
manicured light pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a black velvet beret, a long black sleeveless silk dress, a
silvery gray silk sash, and a pair of black jelly ballet flats with a matching
bow. She is also wearing a fine gold link necklace with a light-catching red
crystal teardrop pendant, a pair of shimmering red crystal drop earrings, and a
glittering red crystal bracelet. Her face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both
elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a large suitcase in her right hand.
Saira Sorrenson frowns at a scorched metachannel FTL communicator.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm on the landing pad
at New Earth."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good luck tara, hope I
didn't scare you off from the glory of exploring deep space using the rift. Nad
happy hunting once again guys."
Saira Sorrenson says, "This thing must've lost a battle with an angry worker at
some point."
Evenia an Eachtrannach says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL
communicator, "I sent you a key to the ship where sean's kitten is. In case I
was busy. So he could get it as soon as possible. The ship is on chet."

just stand there idly taking the hits calmly."

all."

latest edition is basically the latest upgrade. I haven't come out with any
recent updates, but I plan to soon, probably for both books. However, there will
not be a particular edition number; I don't do that anymore, because it's just
easier that way. You will just see posts on AEU/trading with any changes I deem
worthy to be outlined."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Evenia said

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "All I know
about it, is I'm supposed to take care of the bubble stuff and that doesn't go
down until tuesday."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "All I know is 285 is
how I make a large portion of my credits."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's not the out of
communications one is it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er that's not
the out of communications one, right?"

your cleaning thing on my ship?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You know you
can just get the stuff from the supply store and do it right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No but I shall."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just need the
hull brush, the weapon grease and the rust-be-gone. You might find that it's a
bit theraputic. I used to enjoy doing it myself."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's not a
combat ship, you don't even need the weapons grease."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Its a gunship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, yeah
weapons grease then. And the battle mark eraser if you want it, but a lot of
folks don't like to use that. They like to keep thier battle marks as badges of
honor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So,  that's
more of ap erson preference."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. a
personal preference."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Man these laser
turrets."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Man these laser
turrets."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They are pretty
black."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Feel like I used
half a tube of grease on the weapons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Tara was that your
first gunship experience?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "My second, I believe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She was
crewing on Shule's Pulsar earlier today."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ah cool."

awesome on my ship too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thanks guys."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I feel like I still
get hit too much but with rapids its tough flying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Not only do you have
to avoid their locks but also their auto locking assault warps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Eli."

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I thought Nicolette had
you captured in her hair."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Here I am. Remind me
never to nap in a runabout again."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Stiff neck?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah. Not as bad as
the times I've napped in a capsule, but still uncomfortable."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh hey, I have mail."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "I just saw you take off."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Bye bye runabout."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah, I was still
landed over there."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I love this little
ship. I love my capsule, but I can't bring a robot friend with me in that."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I haven't used mine
much since I got my long-ranged sightseer, but yeah, it's a nice little
shuttle."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm still curious what
three of them would do to a tactical platform."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I can show you a
platform with 3 of the other sightseers, but not those ones."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Since the
interplanetary shuttle seems to do cargo space, I'm wondering if perhaps
runabouts would give it speed."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh I meant the
runabout, I know what the sightseers do, for the most part."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If I had 3 tickets
laying around. I'd almost try it. For the hell of it."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You only ned one,
really. If you're just testing it you could use mine and yours."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn sanitation drone,
running off with my water."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh and someon eleft
light-green AEU bikini panties on the bar in here. I wonder who that could have
been."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not me."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably Lexie."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey. Maybe Ather's
crafting fee, is what covers the awesome packaging you get stuff in."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's packaging?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "There is."
[General Communication] "Sanity woman." Evenia an Eachtrannach sighs. "You can
not put an asteroid scanner on a gemini. Well I suppose you could, but..."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Quiet you."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This is what happens
when you don't get your coffee."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Too bad 285 is down."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "On my way back to new
earth now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, I'm in
the lounge."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Right? Well...If I
shoved this thing in a carrier I could get out there. Hell. the parts for the
285 accelerator are on the seekers fucking constructor, which of course...I can
not fly."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's a points issue,
I could probably fly it if you have a key. And I'm supposed to take Tara out to
see the rift in a minute anyways."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nah. Because it's an
AEU ship, I can't fly it. I'm damn sure I'd have the points."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Do you have a key?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If not, I'm not sure
how ot get it up. Not with parts from everybody on it, anyways."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I wish. But someone
took me to see earlier, because I was curious if the parts were there. I'm sure
Morris wouldn't care if I put the thing up, but..."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nicolette, you got a
key to the seekers constructor?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I do but lets not
tell morris."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Can I borrow
it Vernos?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I don't care, feel
kinda screwed by starseekers anyways."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, it will
get your station up, and that's what you wanted, right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yup."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I got a hold of one
Evenia."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Did it hurt?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I made him scream a bit."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Why do you need a key
to..."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "For 285 Nicolette.
Apparently Eva was supposed to put it up before she left and forgot."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Because. The 285
accelerator is on there. And...well. I think maybe it might wanna be put up? I
just get this feeling..."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I mean. I'm only
trying to help out..."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I.. Is thre some sort
of problem? Iwouldn't have thought it was a big deal."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Thank you, ma'am."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did you get one Eve?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Indeed."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'll gladly return it
to Morris when he returns, but I feel like he'd want me to put this up."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably, yes."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Bill him when he returns for
the labor."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If I didn't love
building stations so much, I might. But also...I've never got to build aboard a
constructor before."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh,  it's good times.
The best part is kicking it out hte back."

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's
chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.

Though the curving walls and floor of this spacious corridor seem to be made of
bare gray metal, the walls, meeting seamlessly overhead in an arched ceiling,
glow softly with a pale white light, and the floor is such that it muffles even
the heaviest footfalls. On either side of the corridor is a row of tall windows
that provides on one side a glimpse of the inner curve of the opposite side of
the Torus and, on the other, the sight of the starry black space beyond the

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, speckled white fur,
possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thin, hooked white claws
visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of clear blue eyes with vertical
pupils. It puts out a subtle white bioluminescence tinged with light green.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

sending the message back that just thinks it has to be done that way."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, and that might be
handy if they were sending a lot of information, but a short message like that
"RCVD" would have been fine."
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "It may also be they decided to
send "MSG" followed by two random letters, since they forgot the QE code book."

having me stumble my battlesuit into them."

[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Sounds like a plan. We'll
shove you in ahead of us."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

shit, on our main ship."

breakfast down, and then we can move them over?"

[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh. Well if you can
get into it, go ahead."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits in a dubious tone, "I'm... not
so sure about these vermin space combat missions... how hard are they for
inexperienced fliers?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not
all tha thard, honestly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They start off
real easy, just watch your drive closely for damage."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And if you get
in trouble and can't escape, holler."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Drive?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "One
thing RATS and Bari tend to not do very well is maneuver ably."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Somebody will
come help you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "They're a good way to
get a taste for space combat. RATS tend to target turrets first, too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, the RATs
are going to start eating your ship, and they might damage your wormhole drive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they break it
completely, you're stuck wherever you are, unless you have some special tools."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The drilling sound of
their weapons might be unnerving though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The first
mission you do from them should be real simple though, just aiming at three
probes or so and shooting each one once."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Maybe... I'll hold
up on that then..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "By
special tools he means temporary wormhole drives, which you can get additional
information about in the wonderful pilot's guide to Preparation!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes, definitely
get that book."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ather did you finish
your edits?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "My
edits will be finished when my edits are finished."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "I bought it.
Perhaps I'll read that. The ground missions are easy. It's space I'm not
entirely comfortable with. Odd, from a pilot, I suppose."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, it takes
some getting used to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It
won't be as bad as you think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll get
there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Honestly, I prefer space combat over ground combat. The latter is generally
eh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I rarely agree with
Ather but yeah, what he said."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sorry about that
bruh. I bought them before we actually figured out who was building what. You
find them okay?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I got 'em.
Thanks!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You're welcome. The
next ones will go on the right ship, sorry about that."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, I
don't imagine that someone who is willing to make sure a law which is not even
of his own alliance is upheld over protecting a harmless human faction would be
willing to agree with most of my standings, but there we are."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ather, I can not
comment on that at this time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Of
course not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Needless to say my
actual opinion was asked for by Cheri and Emily on gerneral comms and was
given."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm
sure, I'm sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"You've given many opinions. Most of them contradicted with one another. Hard to
know which one is the real one anymore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Most seem to find
this one more consistent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Most
are also quick to forget, and quicker to forgive."

Ali?"
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I need a toll tracker and
a control center for the Mir and 777 acclerators, respectively, but I can't get
on that ship."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "On my way."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Wait. Star is wanting
in on the accelloraters as well? You won't hear me complaining. But yeah. I
wasn't aware of that."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I don't mind either way."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh get in there bruh.
It's cool with me, I just didn't know is all."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I didn't too."
[General Communication] Ali Candan chortles.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey. It's credits for
the org, I wouldn't argue."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "In what ship I load the parts?"
[General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau
Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth
minutes!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can just push them out
and I'll take care of the rest."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Done."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks!"
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Sure."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So the only
other things I need are two large precharged batteries."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Those are from

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.

from the various starship systems.

You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock

The computer reports that the three-person cannoneer "EAOS Ion Rider Kappa" has
docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
$Z2X!wM#^J%o@E.T|{G=,2P!OdhT2)3$GGR|@*5A
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

deploying them?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits over the sound of buttons
being tapped, "And... back to New Earth to transfer... why is my ship moving
without my say so...?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "New Earth and a
lot of other planets and stations have auto-landers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Some locations have
autobeacons that will have your ship automatically move towards them if you
don't input any commands."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a kind of
safety feature. If you do nothing the autolander will pull you right in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can turn
this feature off if you want, by pressing the settings button on your control
console."

[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
contributed to a new League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Tara, I'm going to
find a way to siphon out all your knowledge. How'd you learn it all so fast?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "777 is great for
salvaging."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I've been listening to
peoples advise and just testing things as much as I can, really."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Can't be afraid to
take risks."

ruin this."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira hms quietly. "Suppose so."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How do I input the plus
and reverse vectors into the rift inserter?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "There's a rift button
up in the control room. You put the heading in there. The station will calculate
the rest."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lordy, oh lordy, good lordy,
great lordy, oh shit and oh hell no I believe were the levels of lordy."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I suppose dear lordy would
rank somewhere between good lordy and great lordy."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You should write out
the levels of lordy on a plaque, and have them in the control room of your
gunship."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Fuck that shit is not
techinally a level of lordy but if I ever say it, lordy just did not cover it."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That will most likely be
reserved for my first encounter with an arbritator."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "BUt yeah, the more you
do stuff, the more comfortable you get it, but if you want a some advise, your
ship cordinates work like this: X, Y, Z. The starmap on the left shows X and Y,
while the one on the right shows X and Z."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "So the exact center of
a sector is 10, 10, 10."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The starmap also shows
some references that indicate where 1, and 20 is."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's an arbitaterr?

starmap is too much information for you, there's a button right near there
marked "RUnDOWN" That will just ive you a list of the things' coordinates in a
sector."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's all a
matter of preference, really."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Thank you, Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "I'm reading this
industry book now. Perhaps it'll offer me some suggestions. I'm not good with
numbers. I expect certain space activities will never be easy due to that. We'll
see if I can contribute in other ways."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You'd think
that. Though to be honest, I thought the same way when I was a cadet, but I've
gotten to where Ican do pretty much every activity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "AeuTime, I
suppose."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's often
ways to simplify. And things are often more complicated looking than they really
are."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like rifting
for example. When the rift drive was first released, I said 'There's no way I'm
going to be able to do this..' But now I rift like a champ."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Rifting?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The rift is very cool.
Besides the random, forced thoughts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Is that like
jumping?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Its like, a form of
extra-dimensional FTL travel, Saira."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, it's not
like jumping at all. It's entering a werid plane of existance. The drive can use
the energies there to go very, very fast."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits a long silence punctuated by
the rifling of pages before a confused voice simply states, "I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Rifting is best
understood when you experience it, to be honest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, and
Tara only got a small taste of it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "A wooden ship was very
different."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But we're
talking thousands of lightminutes per second here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, that's insane."

work a little like a sailboat, if you've ever seen one of those."

meant by headings."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, Tara. I
meant to have you check out the controls while were doing that, but it slipped
my mind with all the other stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Always another time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits with amusement coloring her
tone, "Father's friend had a boat. I capsized it once. Not encouraging."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's even
a ship that we don't have access to, called the ghalleon, that utilizes a jib
and um.. the other things? It's got like 3 different sails to go even
ridiculously faster. I've never been on one myself though."
tra 1 It has a jib, main sail, and mizzen sail
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"It has a jib, main sail, and mizzen sail."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's how so
many folks are out of comms range at the moment. They took a trip to a station
that's like 500 lightyears away or something. The drive makes it like a two week
round trip."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits after a sudden, explosive
sneeze, "Scuse me. And you can actually move when it's going that fast? Jumping
always knocks me over if I try moving, and that's fast."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Rift travel isnt a
bumpy ride, thankfully."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "You might experience
weird things though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, sorry.
I'm babbling excitedly again. I um, tend to get that way when talking about
rifting and exploration stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Exploration's
fascinating. I'm just... a bit of a wimp sometimes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Maybe i'll take you
exploring with me when i'm allowed to buy the scout, Saira."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "That could be
fun!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "How about a hundred
sectors into deep space?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, that
might not be rifting, but I'm convinced that there are still things to find
using conventional drives out there. Folks just don't do it as much anymore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe you two
will make a more local discovery. That would be awesome."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I agree, space is too
big for stuff to not be out there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "S'why I'm here.
Well, you know... I'm nosy. I like poking into things and finding what's there
to find."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits after a beat, "Didn't go over
so well with most of my family members when I kept poking into their stuff, of
course."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's a
couple of books on the market, that are basically logs of expiditions that
people have been on. The problems they faced, and the things that they found.
Some of those are interesting indeed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ugh, Lead is so heavy
yet hardly worth anything."
[MTTS] Squidmind: It's mostly just a colossal amount of work to do relative
naming properly and nobody's really felt up to tackling it.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Whoops!
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Though... after
poking into a bee hive when I was five... sorta learned that sometimes, stuff
pokes back. Painfully. So that keeps me wary... or scared, however you wanna
label it."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ouch!"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."
[MTTS] kayden: A bit of a miscomm there?
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
contributed to a new League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Temporary Station
in Artifact Beacon Alpha 777.
[MTTS] Squidmind: It's not even really tricky, we've done it before with our
other games - Fortharlin, mainly - it's just that the amount of code is
daunting.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ouch! They
weren't megahornets were they? Those things are viscious."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Is there any way to
recharge a ship midflight, by the way?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "No idea. Father
didn't look too thrilled at the sight of my hand though."
[MTTS] Squidmind: It keeps happening.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are
single-use chargers."
[MTTS] kayden: Yes, yes it does.

emergencies."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Carrying one
around is always a good idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You can get them in
the supply store of most starports."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Why not carry
multiple?"
[MTTS] Butchulla: Don't worry, I get it. Typing is really, really hard
sometimes.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can carry as
many as you need. I carry a couple, but I've never used one so I don't know how
much charge they provide."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not much,
they're more for emergencies."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess if you
ran out of juice very far away you might need several, but I don't know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, got all my
stations built."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Larger ships
can also get a blast furnace. It lets you burn debris to increase your charge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be back
around later, friends."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And smaller
ones can still get solar panels. Though, those are tricky to get."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits ponderously, "Well, this book
is saying to do all the vermin missions, so... guess I'll take my shot at
killing probes. But if I get destroyed... I'm probably gonna be in trouble or
something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I want to see a
Magnetar."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We all do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli transmits dreamily, "Oh.. how i want solar
panels
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, no one
has actually been in one of those. No one in the pilot corps anyways."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Best closed
the Explorer's corps, so there's not realy a current way to get one. Though
hopefully we can change that soon enough."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits after a long beat, "Er, I
won't go to jail if I get blown up, right? When I was watching that trial last
night, it seemed like you could get in trouble for having a ship stolen. If
stolen is bad, I assume destructions about ten times worse..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nope."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We gotta get
out there and show them that exploration is a worthwhile endeavor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, Eli, and maybe
an exploration-focused organization would help too."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No you will not go to
jail for that. And also, I don't believe they went to jail for the fighter that
was stolen. Only the League corvette that was intentionally traded."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well thanks for
letting me know. I'm glad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I feel the need to
examine that asteroid near grenwold again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No you will
not go to jail for that. And also, I don't believe they went to jail for the
fighter that was stolen. Only the League corvette that was intentionally
traded."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though if you
lose too many ships, you might get a talking to by the Space Defense Captain.
Luckily ours is currently a prety nice guy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "On second
thought..."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yeah, when this guy Shule was an SDC, he was really mean."

near grenwold seems kind of suspecious."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's a memorial."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "How so? That's been
there forever, and yeah, it's a memorial."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Hey, thtat's your

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"It's ok. I was making sure people were paying attention."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well I guess I need to pay my
respects then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, shule,
that guy was some kind of dissident or something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Got kicked
out of office for stating publicly that he didn't agree with leaving the Accord,
who would do something like that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm so glad
you guys didn't hold it against me for dragging you into this mess."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Nah, we're glad we took a stand."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "So who wants to
shoot stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sure I could use a
change of pace, been salvaging all day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Sure, why not.
Just reading, and I could always use practice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm at the lounge on

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

tell you to shut up...I'd just say it. I like candy-coated things, but I don't
do that myself."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You? Blunt? Never!"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I've told you and told
you, that stuff's not candy."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Why do you think it takes
him so long to produce the finished product?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "For me and all the cadets.
Huh?"
[MTTS] Ulias: Ok, the more I read old headlines about rautines, the more I
realize that apparently someone was joking years ago when they said they were
huge.
[MTTS] Ulias: My perception of space birds has been forever altered.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It is candy damn it."
[MTTS] wulf: Much like the best past catch of the fisherman, it grows ever
bigger with each retelling.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach sighs. "I got the battle of mir
curse."
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Whats that?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's when you get
your accord salvage mission in battle of mir. And you usually only see one chunk
in each sector. It takes. Forever."

[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Can't you just transition to
nearby sectors in deepspace?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You can but it takes a while
and is a pain."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I didn't have the curse, but I
tried salvaging out there and ran into the same issue."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Clear the pad!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "No."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Then do not complain when you

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I actually got
smacked in the head by a capsule once."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well that is not much to worry
about."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "There are so many
cargo options for deliveries when one is couriering. Is there one cargo better
than others so far as points and credits go?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You kidding? That
shit hurt."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits an irritating burst of static.
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ow. Stop that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "For courier
work?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Mhm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Cargo is
better for credits mostly, and priority deliveries are better for points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though you
still don't get much for cargo at the beginning, but once you get a promotion
and start getting bigger ships, you can actually make quite a few credits with
cargo."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've yet to see any
credits as a result of courier work, but I might be misunderstanding the
contract I've signed."
[MTTS] Ulias: Ok, so I think I'm fially gettin git. So black rautines are sorta
like locusts, except birds? That's goddamned terrifying.
[MTTS] Ulias: Not sure why it was hard to get my head around. Probably because I
already had a bad misconception of them.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "How do I prove
myself worthy of a promotion?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just keep
working. Priority delivries are probably best for that, especially if you manage
to make them quickly."

[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Did Kerry give keys to
anybody for his felo ships?"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Doesn't seem like it, I
doubt he even thought about them."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not me. And please.
For the love of everyone's sanity...do not get me started on how fucking cruel
all this is."

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And then all the
other things too."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "This is the piont where I
should talk about how to take care of felo and get you started?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Don't worry the rest of you, I
already heard the introduction to this rant earlier today, I won't actually
inflict that on all of us."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's plain fucked up
is what it is. I hate, animal cruelty."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I don't know how you can
just take off for what's sure to be at least a week and a half to two weeks,
knowing you have ships full of felo, and not even think to make any provisions
for them."

not deserve how they've been treated."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "This isn't the point to talk
about taking fish and putting them in an enclosed space?"
[General Communication] SPCF Member Evenia Callseah transmits, "The difference
here, is that felo are being starved to death."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Never mind, and I think it's
really screwball too. You shouldn't have pets if you can't afford them or don't
intend to take care of them."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "They're umm, out probably
close to 700 lightyears now, I think they're out at least another week and a
half."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] SPCF Member Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well fine.
Whatever. Send kerry back in a fucking pod. To take care of his animals he so
badly wanted."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "So we band together and form
the no felo for kerry coallition?"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Pretty much."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Coallition."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ahh hell, I"m tired."
[General Communication] SPCF Member Evenia Callseah transmits, "I am not. A
happy. Evenia."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Kerry is not one of the
brighter bulbs in the box, this has been known for years. But this matter here
is an entirely different level of stupid."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Evil felo queen has spoken."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'm waiting for her to implant
a tentacular evenitron 9000 on his ships."
[General Communication] SPCF Member Evenia Callseah transmits, "I don't give a
shit how bright. Or not bright someone is. This is just cruel. Sure I've gone
away before. But never. Have I not provided for my animals. Except the Eugene
disaster. And even then...I did my best."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'd say send a message kerry
come save your felo, but no doubt that would be deemed needless and not for the
protection of humanity or something."
[General Communication] SPCF Member Evenia Callseah transmits, "I advise he
doesn't talk to me for a while."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I sent them a hypercast."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Wonder if someone could file
felo abuse charges in a league court?"
[General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Live

covered."

is, there had better not be anymore ships...Because I think I'll go nova."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What happened?"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Kerry didn't feed or provide
keys to anybody to his ships with felo, now there's no food in the holds and
they've started to smell up the garage."

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Don't fucking have
animals if you don't bother...No, I'm sorry...I'll stop."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Some people should maybe be
banned from having felo."

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Just a reminder that if you have felo on
your ships to remember to either travel to Helios across the skim network for
felo chow or to check the repair and rearm on any captial planet for an option
to have your troughs fed. Dead felo create awiful smells that we do not want to
have to deal with. [02:02 31 July 2317 GST]
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nope. I'm done. I'll
stop. If I don't. I won't."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "This is the same fool who
decided a couple years back he didn't really want to be on a trip, and so took
the escape pod back home and a good portion of the rest of the crew with him.
We're not dealing with a genius here."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "But you said, and you didn't
and it's gone on since this afternoon. So just go with the anger and rant."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Totally different
though. This is total cruelty."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I vote for letting yourself
rant."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Has ayone tried useing
the repair shop to feed them, on the off chance that he's got food in the hold."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "A lot of cruelty is
indifference to what your actions will do to other people and or animals."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And nah, I am done
now. Because...I have things to salvage."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Salvage the rant? 5 second
round time?"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I fed them from repair, yes."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah. But that's not
going to do anything for the ones that are already dead. Fucking stupid.
Pathetic..."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "No food in the holds, but
they let me buy some."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Cool Johann."

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er help the ones still
in there."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I agree, it just..."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Doesn't change the fact
that he should have arranged for someon eto do exactly that in the first place,
but at least you have an option instead of just being to sit here hopeless."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "They're most likely all
gone. It was worth a try, but yeah."

go."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Never stop never
stopping."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Reapers hit hard, took
one out but it took three torpedos. It wrecked two of my turrets in one go."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "So if we could lock a lavatory
so sanitation bots couldn't get in, and we wait til they get back, and then lock
kerry in there for a week or so...."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Only works if nobody
flushes."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah,
reapers are the roughest of the RATs, enough of them can even make short work of
a cruiser."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Anyway. Now for something
completely different."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im suprised I managed
to beat one, I was in my fighter."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I am more partial to
luring someone into a closed area, shutting the doors and then releasing the
bees."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's a good one too. In
candelaria we throw them in a vorpal pod bush."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Then you get to shout
"release the bees!" which just adds that small bit of extra satisfaction."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hmm I can see that."

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh that reminds me, I

[MTTS] Ulias: Does putting photos in an album reduce bloat level?
[MTTS] Squidmind: Somewhat. It reduces the object count at least.
[MTTS] Ulias: Ah, ok. Well at least that's something.
[MTTS] something: Are ship titles something that can be compressed? It was just
a thought I just had, considering everyone has loads of them.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Not with the way ship ownership currently works.
[MTTS] usfolks: Sure would be nice to get rid of those titles...and keys. Oh
lord the keys...
[MTTS] Squidmind: Titles have minimal overhead as individual objects go anyway.
Photos and letters are the worst.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Filing computers, too.
[MTTS] usfolks: So...my using the filing computer instead of letters is no
better than keeping all the pieces of paper in terms of the database, just in my
measurement of bloat level?
[MTTS] Butchulla: This is good to know. I try to clean things out at least once
a week, but sometimes it's like...Hell, where do I start.
[MTTS] Squidmind: The fifth largest object in the game is somebody's filing
computer. Ahead of things like the point of interest database and the entire
support ticket system.
[MTTS] usfolks: Oh I do hope it's not mine...it's pretty crowded...
[MTTS] Squidmind: Text is very bloaty.
[MTTS] Ulias: Hahaha, I do'nt nkow why that makes me laugh, but it does. I have
a suspcion I know which character's it is.
[MTTS] something: For the sake of blote, would it be better to emote using the
filing computer, and just have all that text on your actual computer?
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, I can think of a few whose might be worse than mine. I try
to keep stuff on my actual computer, but a lot of things I roleplay the computer
anyway, so might as well have it in there.
[MTTS] Squidmind: They need a better solution anyway.
[MTTS] something: I coppy pasted single pages of books into mine to avoid having
to keep the entire book cause I thought it was less bloty...
[MTTS] usfolks: I think...at least for my part, I'm a data hoarder. I have
backups of my backups of my backups. So keeping something in-game seems somehow
safer than files on my computer.
[MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, I used to keep things just on my computer, but I've lost so
many things so many times.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Books export their text, they're quite streamlined these days.
[MTTS] something: Ah.
[MTTS] usfolks: Good. I don't feel quite as bad about my char's book collection
then. Heh.
[MTTS] kayden: Is it not like if your not reading it then the info isnt stored
or something?
[MTTS] Ulias: I just keep teetering between moderate bloat and moderately
excessive. I'm trying to at least keep it at moderate.
[MTTS] usfolks: I don't even remember when I was last at moderate. But when I
went to excessive I freaked out a bit.
[MTTS] Squidmind: The text is hashed, the books store the hash and use it to
grab the text from an external file on demand.
[MTTS] Ulias: I bet it's more like, the text for each book isn't in the book
itself and all pulls from the same piece of text.
[MTTS] something: I keep trying to get it under moderate but there's just a lot
of stuff that either seems like a cool roleplay prop or is actually useful.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I try to do the same thing. I try to be very conscious of the
poor server.
[MTTS] Ulias: Quidmind put it better, of course.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Database size versus processing time, the eternal battle.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I hear ya.
[MTTS] something: How large is the database, at the moment?
[MTTS] usfolks: I've heard that discussed before on MTTS.
[MTTS] something: Very curious.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Just over 300mb.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I was waiting for something like, 700 MB. I'm certainly glad
it is not that.
[MTTS] Ulias: I know one thing, SSN certainly does not help me keep my bloat
down. I get my stuff cleaned out, and before you know it I've ordered like ten
more things from SSN.
[MTTS] something: I wonder how muds with the players in the hundreds at a time
deal wiht bloat.
[MTTS] usfolks: I've wondered if the gifting thing has significantly increased
bloat. When people send each other 10 of an item randomly, it can't help.
[MTTS] Butchulla: SSN is that lovable thing that you want to hate, but can't.
[MTTS] Squidmind: SSN was such a hilariously stupid and bizarrely successful
addition that I can't imagine getting rid of it.
[MTTS] usfolks: Not to mention the exclusive items.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained
8,703,703.70 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU
Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the three-person clipper

[MTTS] Butchulla: Oh please don't. I'd rather bari every day and invasions every
week, than losing SSN.
[MTTS] something: Somehow, even in text, the pull of the shopping channel is
irresistible.
[MTTS] Ulias: Yeah SSN is super cool, please don't ever lose that.
[MTTS] usfolks: Come now. Bari and invasions are FUN! Just don't do what that
other host did and threaten to replace events with invasions. PLEASE?
[MTTS] Butchulla: No, please no. I would beg the wonderful squid never to do
that.
[MTTS] usfolks: If said host were to replace plots...oh yeah, was plots,
sorry...with invasions, it would make me quite sad. Fortunately the Squidmind
has quite the sense of humor.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "This pilot is crazy,
I want a replacement."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone gasps.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Deploying replacement

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Go little blue go!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Have you been giving
him private flying lessons?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, Zeus has."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey. That's an idea.
Zeus can engineer. Little blue can fly. And goldenpants can gun."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey! That's Sir
goldenpants."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah...but he likes
me, I figured he wouldn't mind goldenpants from me."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He likes you, but we
are all lowly peasants to Sir goldenpants."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He may seem all sweet
during the day, but at night he sneaks out and commits atrocities."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ah. So now I know
where he and cheeky sneak off to."

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach sniffles.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hye, I'm not

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You do realize I'm

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, I don't take any

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Message tops?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I didn't know what

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I can put one or 3 on

[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you could put one on

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den", the one-person cargo hauler "Windflight", and
the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
