01:27 You hear someone happily recount a recent asteroid mining victory.

01:28 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:16 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:17 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:17 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots: we have a couple reminders to bring before you for today. First and foremost, we have a meeting tomorrow at 19:00, in the New Earth conference room. All pilots, cadet and otherwise should consider coming, as the meeting will, in my opinion be reasonably important. Secondly, I would like to remind all pilots, cadet and otherwise to keep your ships powered down and off of the landing pad when they are not in use. Failing to do that, could cause a Bari infestation to rapidly spread if there is suddenly an outbreak of Bari infestations, which does tend to happen from time to time. [00:16  7 April 2318 GST]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a greater minimodule of damage capacity and projectile boost, a greater minimodule of projectile boost and projectile resistance, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a greater minimodule of armor boost and plasma boost, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow.
You can go up and out.

03:02 a gold wrist-mounted chronometer

03:02 It covers nothing.
You glance down at your watch, noting the time:
1JOIH.5H3 [0102 GST]

03:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:08 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Two for a nest."

03:08 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Tier?"

03:09 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Any."

03:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:13 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "If interested, please list your highest tier suits. Need one more."

03:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:29 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:29 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

03:29 Lily says to you, "Ok guess I'll take us back to the Torus."

03:29 You smile. "Ok."

03:29 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:29 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:29 You say to Lily, "I love you hun."

03:29 Lily says to you, "I love you too1."

03:29 You beam at Lily Kaise.

03:29 Lily says to an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, "Love you too!"

03:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:29 You laugh.

03:30 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starfish, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:30 Lily says to you, "I love you too!"

03:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:30 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:30 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
You beam at Lily Kaise.

03:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:30 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:30 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:30 Lily Kaise beams at you.

03:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:30 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:30 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Starfish! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:30 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:30 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:30 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:31 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Starfish. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:31 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

03:31 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:31 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:50 A short gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
