-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

02:48 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:49 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 248" has jumped into the sector.

02:49 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 248! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

02:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:49 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

02:49 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:49 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

05:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Ah. No worries if you are busy, I was simply hoping to get in touch. I've not heard from any of the members of the expedition since your return, aside from the letter and missed call."

05:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, I tried to call you several times. I actually want to do a bit of a get-together this weekend to discuss what took place, to show a couple films, and to discuss a few very important matters."

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Look for a comm notice quite soon!"

05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Yes, I fear I was indisposed for a few days just around your return so I missed those. I hope that I will be able to attend the get-together. Generally a little later in the evening is ideal, but I should be somewhat flexible."

05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "A little later is what I prefer too, so this is grand."

05:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Excellent, I look forward to it. It has been painfully quiet with the four of you gone."

08:02 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Much belatedly. I think some custom audio emotes do work over the phone. But I haven't really messed with it much."

08:02 [Newbie Help] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "How are they done?"

08:02 [Newbie Help] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Because if I could I'd do them all the time."

08:03 [Newbie Help] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "With the colons? Like over the communicator?"

08:14 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You walk up into the control room of the temp station, and type transfer. That will send the module off. Then depending on a few things, payment can take from...around 5 minutes to 20."

20:03 [Newbie Help] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "Ta."

20:03 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Double check you didn't match to the wrong container when you were putting it in. Or if it was a ration box and it was purchased empty...that may well be something to support."

20:04 [Newbie Help] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "I checked it when I first got it. It had like 4 or 5 things in it iirc. Mistargeted the box on the shelf, pulling it down instead of the shine crate and the ration box was empty."

20:05 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. Ration boxes could be different? I honestly don't know. I've not used them much since more palatable food is available widely in game."

20:07 [Newbie Help] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "For testing purposes, I'll open one and leave the other closed. Might be a decay cuz open thing?"

20:07 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Possible. Stuff like that tends to be made to disappear after awhile. Not surprising since it builds up bloat in the database."

20:08 [Newbie Help] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "Noted. I should probably keep my shine box closed in that case."

20:08 [Newbie Help] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have emptied them into a cooler before but yes I believe they may likely decay in a shorter period if you don'tput the contents into a cooler."

21:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Alright. It's been some time since I have had the notice myself. I believe the one you are asking after says that SEAS will not be reconstructing their temporary salvage station and encourages pilots to reconsider working at the moment, yes?"

21:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Emmelie Princeton transmits, "Yes. Why would you not work?"

21:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I am continuing to work. However, there are a number of pilots staging protests against the direction of our government. They are refusing to work, and thus bring money in for the government, in retaliation for the stance held regarding Unregs and, more grievously, the amnesty offered to the rogue navy and Janus."
