02:55 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The four-person light carrier "Distant Wanderer" is landed here.

02:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:56 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:56 Michael Kennedy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Imformative plaque."

02:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Beacon B-24. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:56 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

02:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:56 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

Hello. I am going to take some people out to NQ for a couple of days. For those of you who have never been, it is a lovely station about 3 or 4 hours away, with lots and lots of maple. It is also a place to relax and have fun, for couples it is a romantic get away, or from my experience it is just a lovely change of scenery to go to decompress from stress. I liked bird watching in the tree district area there. I will be leaving around 1400 hours on tuesday, and will leave NQ at 1400 hours to return, on friday. If you would like to join us for a little short vacation, be at Old Earth lounge before 1400 on the departure date. If you have any questions, please respond to this post, send me a letter, or call me. My number is in the directory. Also if you won't be awake around 1400 on Tuesday and you'd still like to go Let me know, so I can send you a key to my ship I'll be taking so you can camp out there prior to ddeparture.

04:49 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, a black

12:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It went well. Made some good credits and we stopped over at Feng Wo too. So glad I stuck around for that."

12:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And thanks."

12:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I would have liked to see Feng wo again, but they were staying another week for artifacting and that was really a bit long for my taste."

12:29 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

12:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Maybe Alko got a hotel room himself? So you were not allowed to get hotel rooms?"

12:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Lily and I didn't get a hotel room and were not planning on staying the night. Lily just wanted to show me what the rooms were like."

12:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Johann had told everyone to stay close to the ship as we were not planning on staying very long. Long enough to get charged up."

12:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And yeah, it was."

12:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That makes no sense, you go to feng wo to show it to people yet you don't stay longer than necesary to charge the ship?"

12:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah... Well, I would have loved to stay longer, but I was not the one in charge."

12:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do not like Johann's style of organizing very much anyway. I do hope he went with them to find alko though."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

16:19 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

22:34 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

22:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on the floor.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike", the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Zeta-6", and the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Lambda-7" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
