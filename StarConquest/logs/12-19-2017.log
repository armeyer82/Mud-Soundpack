02:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

02:22 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

02:47 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:47 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:47 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

02:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:47 Lily Kaise says, "I guess we can always give some a key to fetch them if not."

02:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:48 You nod.

02:48 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:48 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

02:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:48 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:48 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

02:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:48 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:48 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

02:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:48 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:48 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

02:48 Lily Kaise says, "So m."

02:48 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:48 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

02:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:48 Lily Kaise says, "I imagine we can but I just want to move the ships off."

02:48 You say, "That'd be a good idea."

02:49 The computer reports that the two-person Accord corvette "Peacekeeper Task Force Phi 2" has jumped into the sector.

02:49 The computer reports that the two-person Accord corvette "Peacekeeper Task Force Tau 1" has jumped into the sector.

02:49 Lily Kaise asks, "So do you mind getting the org ship?"

02:49 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

02:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:49 You say, "Nope."

02:49 You ask, "Which one is it?"

02:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:49 Lily Kaise says, "Ok then we'll come back for mine."

02:49 You ask, "Which ship?"

02:49 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:49 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:49 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:49 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

02:49 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:50 Lily Kaise says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "For those who are so worried! We can indeed land on Accord."

02:50 You say to Lily Kaise, "Which ship you want me to get?"

02:50 Lily Kaise says, "The org ship."

02:50 You peer out...

[Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four]
This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. One of the EMMs is emitting a steady hum, indicating that it should be replaced. A ramp leads up to the rest of the station.

02:50 You ask, "Oh Building Capitol?"

02:50 Lily Kaise says, "No Seas spare parts."

02:51 You say, "Oh, that one.'ok."

02:51 Lily Kaise nods.

02:51 [Starship "SEAS Spare Parts"; Control Room]

02:51 You can go south and out.

02:51 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:51 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Building Capital is mine."

02:51 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, ok."

02:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Where do you want to land this?"

02:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Do you want to move this to the new station?"

02:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good question probably New Earth but I doubt we'll get chased off of Torus since we have a NAP so hmm good question let's put it on New Earth though."

02:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

02:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:52 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:03 [Starship "Profitable Cause"; Control Room]

03:03 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You can go up and out.

12:42 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

12:42 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

12:54 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

12:54 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

12:55 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

12:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:55 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:55 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

12:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:56 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

12:56 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

12:56 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:56 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:56 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

12:56 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:57 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

12:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

12:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

12:57 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:57 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:57 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:58 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

13:00 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Chopsticks". The organization has earned 2,713,882.58 credits.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
22:34 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Merry Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event!

This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However, we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make sure everyone gets a gift!

First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and celebration a little closer to the holiday!

Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos
22:34 , custom hair styles, small "plastic surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much, please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to add additional lines of text!

Thank you!
   Announced 1 day, 19 hours, 5 minutes, and 36 seconds ago

22:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)
