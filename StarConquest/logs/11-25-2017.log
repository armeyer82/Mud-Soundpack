01:38 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo

01:38 This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in very long, speckled violet fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. Its fur is a normal short length on its legs and face, but elsewhere the fur is very long, spreading across the ground when it lies down and giving it a thick fluffy tail. The felo's short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thin, hooked white claws visible. A indigo, heart nose sits below a pair of clear blue eyes with vertical pupils. It has a small pair of golden butterfly wings.

Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:40 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

20:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:41 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

20:41 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:41 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:41 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Justen Moon. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:49 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places.

You can go south, up, and out.

20:51 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:51 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:51 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

20:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:51 The ship is already moving.

20:51 The ship is already moving.

20:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Endymion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

20:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:52 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

Via general sector communication, Endymion transmits, "Hello there, Justen Moon! Welcome to home space!"

20:52 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Endymion.

20:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:52 I don't understand that.

20:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:52 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Justen Moon. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:53 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

20:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:53 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:53 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:07 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:07 The ship is already moving.

21:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:07 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:07 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:07 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:07 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I can't figure out how to store upgrades at an upgrade center."

21:07 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Justen Moon! Welcome to home space!"

21:07 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Your communicator also reports that there are 9 pilots who were active but dropped out of communications.
Additionally, there are 10 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 25 pilots.
Want to know if anyone's relaxing in a public venue? Check WHERE!

21:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok hmm I have no idea which one did you go to?"

21:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:08 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Justen Moon. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I went to one on New Earth and the one on Endymion."

21:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:08 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:08 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Airlock]

21:08 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:08 You exit the ship.

21:08 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

21:09 I don't understand that.

21:09 You close the door.

21:09 You remove the 16:00 18/11 AEU space defense report from a brushed steel desk.

21:09 In addition, there appears to be some writing on the 16:00 18/11 AEU space defense report...

21:19 New Phoenix's heavy industry was especially hard hit by the bombardment of the city. Several years ago, factories, research facilities, and industrial parks populated the area north of here, but it is now closed to the public, and large signs mounted to high concrete barriers stretching across the north end of the street warn of various types of deadly hazards. Still, rebuilding is taking place, evident in the construction of several large warehouses nearby. Among them is a shiny new store, an elegant sign near the door reading, 'Blazing Trails.'

21:25 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:25 I can't find "chair."

21:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:25 The ship is already moving.

21:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:25 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

21:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:26 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:26 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Endymion.

21:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:26 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Justen Moon. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

21:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:27 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:27 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
