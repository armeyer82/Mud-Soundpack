You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

15:05:44 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:05:45 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:05:46 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:05:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:05:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:05:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:05:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:06:02 The ship is already moving.

15:06:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:06:03 Which sector did you mean?

15:06:04

Enter your selection:

15:06:05 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Torus Corridor. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:06:05 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:06:08 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

15:06:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:06:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:06:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:06:13 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Xenology Research Waypoint Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:06:16 Via general sector communication, Xenology Research Waypoint Station transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Torus Corridor!"

15:06:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:06:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:06:26 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:06:29 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

15:06:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

15:06:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:06:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:06:52 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:06:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:06:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:07:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:07:09 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:07:09 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:07:12 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:07:41 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

16:43:07 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:43:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:43:11 Not much to see out there.

16:43:14  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white socks and a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

16:43:14 You are carrying nothing.

16:43:19 You peer south...

16:43:20 
[Starship "Firestorm"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a large leather chair, an improved temporary wormhole drive, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and down.

16:43:25 You can't go that way.

16:43:28 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

16:43:28 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and an insulated red sleeping bag here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

16:43:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

16:43:30 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes, and Shine the big white glowing felo here.

17:10:12 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

17:10:12 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a fuzzy stuffed bear, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.

17:11:25 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:11:26 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:11:29 'angel' could refer to more than one person. Please be more specific.

17:11:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

17:11:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:11:38 Angel Martin has an active communicator.

17:11:41 The ship is already moving.

17:11:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:11:44 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:11:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:11:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

17:11:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:11:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:11:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:11:51 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:11:52 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

17:12:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

17:12:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:12:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:12:17 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:12:17 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:44:38 [Suborbital Pod: Landfall to New Phoenix]

17:44:39 You can go nowhere.
As soon as you board the pod, it launches from the station, beginning a long arc above the surface.

17:46:42 The suborbital pod reaches the top of its arc, coming to a gradual stop before beginning to plummet back to the surface.

17:48:36 The pod's braking thrusters suddenly kick in, abruptly slowing the pod as it nears the surface.

17:48:46 The pod settles onto the ground, and you depart.

18:03:28 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hmmm, what tier 5 do you have Ted?"

18:03:35 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Only Fringe."

18:04:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:04:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

18:04:33 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am not sure if it will work out but, let's try the Mutey 4 in case we need some backup reps."

18:04:40 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:04:40 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:04:49 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:04:49 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "OK."

18:04:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:04:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:05:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:05:53 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

18:07:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:07:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:07:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:07:27 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:07:28 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

18:07:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:07:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:07:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:07:32 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

18:07:34 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

18:07:34 --

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

18:07:34 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

18:07:35 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

18:07:37 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:08:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:08:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

18:08:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

18:08:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:08:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:08:20 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:08:20 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:08:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:08:52 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

18:09:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok so...greater ammo and energy cap and a greater energy cap. Hopefully that'll help. I don't have an energy gen, unfortunately."

18:09:28 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:09:28 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

18:09:30 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I do."

18:09:31  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white socks and a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

18:09:31 You are carrying a package in your right hand.

18:09:58 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I only have major generation, and greater armor and minis boost on here."

18:10:16 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "What's set up on that suit?"

18:10:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Chains, microdrones, Plasma and sonics."

18:11:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

18:12:47 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Come get a greater energy mod from me."

18:13:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "In a sec, got somewhere else I need to go first."

18:17:20 [General Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Did you still want to talk Mel? I can wait until after whatever it is you folks are doing."

18:17:51 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "After if you don't mind."

18:18:02 [General Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Not at all."

18:18:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good morning allies."

18:18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Good moring."

18:18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Good morning Constantine."

18:21:51 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Not A Target Drone!". The organization has earned 1,110,343.04 credits.

18:25:37 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Ted, did you get lost?"

18:25:45 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Heya mel."

18:25:52 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yo."

18:25:53 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oh, I missed you leaving, I tried asking you a question."

18:26:02 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "What was the question?"

18:26:14 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Can you hear him from there?"

18:26:20 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Mmm. I think I found awake again."

18:26:22 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes."

18:26:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Angel!"

18:40:24 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Does anyone know if 777 is up?"

18:43:57 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say everything there is up currently."

18:44:03 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 695,623.26 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

18:44:11 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Thank you."

19:11:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

19:11:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Constantine, I need a word with you."

19:12:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

19:12:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How urgent is it and how long will you be around? I'm out at the radio bubble."

19:12:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll come in if need be."

19:13:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would have probably stayed out here for about two hours."

19:13:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Are you on the ophone directory?"

19:13:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah."

19:13:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will just look you up then and give ya a call."

19:39:54 There appear to be about 13 pilots recently active.

21:21:08 From a phone-based holoemitter: The image flashes white, and the words "COMPETITIVE TEA-DRINKING 2310 INTERPLANETARY CHAMPIONSHIP" appear as the view rotates rapidly around a large stadium.

21:21:20 From a phone-based holoemitter: A sports commentator says, "Hello! And welcome to the Competitive Tea-Drinking Interplanetary Championship! Tonight's match, the FINAL match, is between New Earth veteran Lynx Forrest and a newcomer from Ars Magna, Woodward Whittaker Derringer."

21:21:37 From a phone-based holoemitter: The crowd filling the stadium cheers wildly as the commentator continues. "Forrest has had a hard season, and for a time it was far from a sure thing that he would ever make it this far!"

21:21:55 From a phone-based holoemitter: "But he's here tonight, and facing off against rookie Derringer, who has come out of NOWHERE to take the sport by storm this season!"

21:22:08 From a phone-based holoemitter: "Forrest is still the favorite to take the championship title tonight, but as they say, folks, the truth is in the tea! And it looks like we're about ready for the first cup of the night!"

21:22:26 From a phone-based holoemitter: The view abruptly zooms into the middle of the field, where a small round table is set up, quaint dark wooden chairs in place, and its surface decorated with a pair of doilies. Two impeccably-dressed men are just now placing trays and tea services next to each of the competitors.

21:22:51 From a phone-based holoemitter: "The competitors' seconds are pouring the first cup. It looks like veteran Forrest hopes to start simple but win over the judges with superior technique, as he's chosen a classic lemon tea for his first cup."

21:23:09 From a phone-based holoemitter: "Newcomer Derringer has chosen a rather more daring approach with a cup of orange tea. And he's... not taking any sugars!"

21:23:21 From a phone-based holoemitter: You watch Forrest accept a cube of sugar from his second with a smile. The commentator says, "Forrest accepts one sugar... and we're off!"

21:23:33 From a phone-based holoemitter: The two men eye each other intently as they carefully swirl their steaming cups of tea.

21:23:43 From a phone-based holoemitter: Time passes.

21:23:48 From a phone-based holoemitter: Forrest takes the first sip.

21:23:53 From a phone-based holoemitter: "First blood!" shouts the commentator. "Forrest has taken a sip of his piping hot beverage without betraying the slightest reaction! Derringer will have to catch up fast if he hopes to stay competitive!"
