Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and
a large leather lounge couch here.
Lileah Rose (sitting on a large leather lounge couch) is here.
You can go south and out.

You kiss Lileah Rose.
Lileah Rose kisses you.
-lileah Hi love
You say to Lileah Rose, "Hi love"
Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.
cuddle lileah
You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.
Lileah Rose pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.
Lileah Rose grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
grin
You grin.
launch
You notify flight control of your desire to launch.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to
launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."
Lileah Rose chuckles.
'I have no idea where the Jinu ship is.
You say, "I have no idea where the Jinu ship is."

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk

Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an old
engine casing.

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk

A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.
sal
You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an old
engine casing.
