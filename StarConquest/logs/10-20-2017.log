02:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:02 Lily says to you, "Wait a few."

02:02 Lexie Amarras's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Like the plaque."

02:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I need to settle."

02:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

02:03 Cadet Kert On'Marr ambles south.

02:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We need to wait until I settle and I should have come in here already sorry buys."

04:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I found out the hard way.. after being ambushed by a small fleet of pirates."

04:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hey, Constantine."

04:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How's it going?"

04:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Eh... it's going. Been a long day."

04:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Even longer when you lose your first ship.. ever."

04:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, what happened?"

04:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Not the first ship I lost, just the first ship I owned.. was lost."

05:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Pirates over Grenwald. I was on route to SVP when I got caught in the indicted sector.. I couldn't land or anything.. was so badly damaged.. they finally got me. I blew... they had... about 12 ships. gunships, pincers...bolt throwers..."

05:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Then.. later, when shule was forced to land... and managed to land. The Accord sent a fleet of corvettes, a cruiser."

05:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yep.."

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thankfully, they didn't chain me."

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Mine was gone.. and running around was all I could do.. till I tried to make a 'run' for it for the planet."

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah.."

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, but with your engines, you couldn't out run them."

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Nope."

05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Not with that bolt-thrower."

05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Did you run directly for the planet or did you run around a bit?"

05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I ran around a bit. Drew them away from the planet.. then made a run for it."

05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "But... I couldn't land. And... well... I had pleasant flight in that rescue pod."

05:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Why couldn't you land?"

05:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Like I said already.. it didn't take much to finish me off..."

05:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Sensors had to 'recaliberate'."

05:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Probably because his little fighter was getting clobbered like your Pulsar was and he couldn't land."

05:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, so they must have hit you while you were running for the planet?"

05:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

05:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You know how there's a delay."

05:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, that makes sense. Not much you could have done. You did it right though."

05:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I guess the sensors just can't quite adjust to all of that."

05:20 You say, "That's why it's important to run around enough before trying to land."

05:20 You say, "That's why we could land when we did."

05:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well he doesn't have a very fast engine and he's far less experienced than you are Love."

05:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

05:21 You say, "Oh, I know. HE did the best he could under those circumstances."

05:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Erm he didn't have."

05:21 You say, "I told him that he did it right though."

05:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Frustrating as I can't just go give him enough funds to replace his ship."

05:21 You say, "I know."

05:22 You say, "They locked on to us while we were running for the planet, but couldn't hit us."

05:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Thankfully as two shots and we'd have been in a similar situation to Johnathon."

05:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But seriously, good job. You handled it right. If you had just a faster engine, you would have made it."

05:23 You say, "I know."

05:24 You say, "But I figured we'd have enough speed by the time we got in firing range that they couldn't hit us."

05:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well my heart was in my moth heh! I was so glad that I got the hull to 3 failsafes down."

05:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Mouth that is."

05:24 You say, "I know. You did great."

05:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. I could say the same."

05:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs chuckles.

05:25 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

05:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just felt so sorry for him. He seems to have taken it well though and just enjoyed the ride heh."

05:26 You nod.

05:26 You say, "He actually helped by giving us valuable information while he was in the rescue pod."

05:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He sure did."

05:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Johnathon thank you for being so calm out there. I know it was likely rather scarey initially and we appreciate the information you shared."

05:28 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

05:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I sure haven't done much except for a couple of beacons and that incident. I just haven't had time to do the Bari Cleansing... let's see."

05:29 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "But... then it happened. I just strapped myself in.. and waited till the sector was clear. I had a good advantage point, at that point.."

05:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You should have a fat stack of reports from John and I at Tesla."

05:29 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo jumps down from your lap.

05:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh well I sure won't be able to until this next Conquest and I don't see tesla."

05:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah..."

05:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

05:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Those will be a huge pile."

05:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Lucky you..."

05:30 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:31 You say to Lily, "Let's go lie down."

05:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

23:38 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hi everyone. Here is our state of the corps report since the beginning of the term: we've completed 16 out of 88 decoy beacon drops, and only destroyed 4 of 40 destroyed RATS nests. Lastly, we've only hauled a total of 130 out of 1101 asteroids. There have been no salvage ops run so far, and there haven't been any exploration trips done lately, so no planets discovered and no salvage ops done. [21:19 20 October 2317 GST]
