Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Dear Diary,
I've stopped writing for a while because I felt like I lost my inner voice. I
don't have the energy to write what has become of me ever sense the last time I
wrote in this book. I just know that I'm struggling to move on from Ather, but
I'm just struggling with not being angry at myself for wondering why I bothered
to give my heart to him, and why I allowed myself to keep having faith in him
for so long. He gave me back my bracelet that I gave him. It symbolized my
heart. He told me that he does not believe in that one person in the whole
entire galaxy for that other person. He told me to move on, and to hink of him
as a friend who does not have my heart, but is there for me when I need
something, and a friend who has my back. It left me numb, because I knew that I
could not find any more reason to keep fighting and hoping for him. It left me
shocked and numb because it hurt. I won't even try to explain just how much it
did. Anyways, I've turned away from Ather in the concept of having anything to
do with him romance wise. I know now for sure that he does not want me in that
way. I am just so very, I do not know how to explain. I sigh as I write this and
wonder if I should continue to write my ramblings on this page. In the time of
moving on from Ather, I had 3 suiters. Caleb, Joel, and this pilot named Jimmy.
One I was willing to date, but he romanced me and unfurled my wings of hope, and
then vanished unexpectedly. It broke my heart some more. And I didn't think my
heart could be broken off anymore than it already was. So I've gone hauling at
284 which is a station that Sean has built in an asteroid field. I've been here
for about 2 weeks I think. I've been goin back home in my Capsule every now and
again. I am not sure how I am doing right now. I gues I just feel lost. But it's
not the same lost feeling as when I got lost in the rift. I feel, sane, not
emotionally wrecked, not all confuddled and scared. I feel more wraw and pained,
and numb. I cannot explain it. But I know I'm okay over all. I refuse to not be
not okay, I refuse to let my troubles drown me. I'm just...bewildered and numb
inside. There's also my growing feelings for Pierre. He was the last person I
expected to grow feelings for, and I'm not sure I like this. I guess this is
what's troubling me most. He was not even one of my suiters, things just
happened. Then we got very naughty with each other, and I'm a grown woman and it
was, it was very nice. I'm just working on clenching my heart like a fist, and
denying my budding feelings for him. Why? It would be like a dying star to be
rejected again. My heart doesn't need it. I should toughen up like the other
girls and not be so, vonerable. I believe that Pierre will reject me if I told
him of my feelings for him, because, what I know of him is that he is like Joel
and loves women. So I doubt he would settle with me. I mean, I doubt he would be
interested in a serious relationship with me. What I know of him personally, is
that he is a wonderful, benevolent, funny mister, and he makes me smile. I'm
also very shy around him, though I try to keep a cool face about me in his
presence. He has not rejected me so far, but I believe if he knew of my growing
feelings for him, he will reject me and distance himself from me. Though
eventually I might tell him so, for I like to be honest with my friends. It is
strange. I have heard that Pierre was quite the ladys' man, but he never once
flirted with me, or tried to woo me until I flirted with him first. I wonder if
that means anything. But I also wonder now that I am now one of the women that
he has wooed and romanced, if I mean less to him. That is even if I meant more
to him when he did not even flirt with me. I don't know what is up with me. I
hope I'll sort myself out soon. All I know is the stuff concerning Pierre, my
resent towards Ather, my resent towards myself, and my bitterness towards
romance and myself. At leastI know I'm okay with everything else. I'm going home
Saturday, like back to Mercy Heights for a few days. Maybe then my head will be
cleared. But I do miss Mister Pierre. I miss how he held me so, gently and ran
his fingers through my hair so softly and tenderly. I miss him smiling at me. I
miss smiling at him. Oh for stars sake, now I'm just rambling. There. I have
written the best I could on what's become of me ever since I last wrote. It may
be gappy and cramped-like, but it will stress me out if I have to explain in
extreme detail how my heart broke and all that shitty sap. I'll be okay, because
I have to be.

Dear Diary,
So my suspicion has been confirmed that Pierre would not be interested in me,
having a relationship with me wise. I told him not to worry for me, that I am
not the weak vonerable girl that once dated Ather. But I'm only denying myself.
Of course I won't go crying to the rift about my hurt feelings, but I don't know
if I'll ever be tough enough to just gloss over being rejected. It is not his
fault. I don't blame him, I only blame myself, because they're my feelings. He
was only being honest and I am so grateful for that. What is wrong with me? I am
a good pilot, I am great and strong in all else, but when one brings up the
subject of Katina's romance love story, it' is cold and haunting. Why do I grow
feelings for unloyal men, or men that are enamored with me, then gro bored of
me, or something of that sort? The more I experience heartbreak here in the
core, the more my innocent and hopeful views on love and romance are lessened
and defiled. Hell I do not even believe in love anymore. I believe love is a
blue rose. But as I wrote to Pierre, experiencing pilot life has made me grow
and toughen in some ways. The more my innocent view of romance gets marred,
defiled, and betrayed, the colder my heart gets. I mean, would you see me
sleeping with men and having casual sex with them in my earlier days as a pilot?
No.

to suddenly go, I could understand. Because when you love someone you love their
flaws as well as their good, you love all of them. He'll never know how much I
cherish him in my heart, or how much he hurt me."

Dear Casen,
As Founder of SEAS, I would like to extend an invitation to you to consider
joining Space Explorers Amidst the Stars (SEAS), an AEU Organization.
SEAS is a full facility organization with a well-equipped fleet of starships to
rent as well as we have two cruisers which are supported and room for two
additional cruisers at this time for qualified pilots.
SEAS has access to the Organization area's Genetics Lab and the Range office for
monitoring the activity of Temporary Space Stations. We actively support and
build Temporary Space Stations to promote income-producing work for AEU and all
pilots who utilize those Temporary Space Stations.
SEAS encourages our members to participate in Exploration opportunities and
plans to sponsor Expeditions over time.
As a member of SEAS, there is no established requirement of you to contribute
earned Points or Credits. unless you are promoted to Trustee or become Cruiser
qualified with a Cruiser to support. Otherwise, all contributions are voluntary
as our primary goal is to help you to develop to your fullest potential. At some
point when you feel that you would like to contribute towards organizational
goals, you would be welcomed to but never required to unless there is some
unforeseen circumstance which has depleted our resources. So far though, SEAS
has sufficient enough resources to well sustain it's activities and to support
it's infrastructure.
When you become Cruiser qualified and SEAS takes on the responsibility to seek
Alliance support of your Cruiser, then we would appreciate credits contributed
towards its support as it costs SEAS 80,000,000 Credits per Conquest Period to
maintain continued Alliance Support and this is per each Cruiser supported.
Although this is an expensive sum per Conquest, We believe that it is necessary
that the Corps has enough Cruisers to aid in the defense of humanity. Therefore,
SEAS will support member Cruisers for as long as we are reasonably able to.
SEAS is selective in who we will choose to recruit as members. Although we enjoy
socializing, we are focused and serious about our work. We want our members to
represent strong ethical values as well. We have observed your progress and we
believe that you represent these core values.
If you have attained 30 days as a Pilot and are interested in becoming a member
of SEAS, We would look forward to the opportunity to consider adding you as a
member of SEAS.
Please contact shule Elemmire, Constantine Stone or myself if you have questions
or when you are ready to join and we will meet with you and if everyone is in
agreement, we will invite you in.
Kind regards
Lily Kaise

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
