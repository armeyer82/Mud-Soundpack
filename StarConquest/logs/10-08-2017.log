13:09 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

13:09 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

13:09 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

13:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:09 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 842" has landed on the planet New Earth.

13:10 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "How's it going Ted?"

13:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

13:10 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Not bad, mining as usual, yourself?"

13:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:10 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

13:10 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not too bad. Just waking up for the day."

13:10 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

16:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "If you don't want to ever communicate with another ship or with the Hypercasters this way, then you don't need the Hypercaster."

16:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's not really that I don't want it, it's that I can't buy it."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a gl

21:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

21:17 You say, "Who knows."

21:17 You say, "Because he's probably not as good as he makes himself out to be."

21:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Heh exactly!"

21:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's funny that others call him an idiot."
