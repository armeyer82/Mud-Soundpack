-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

01:58 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:58 You're already sitting.

01:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:58 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:58 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:58 The ship is already moving.

01:58 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] A space station chief technician transmits, "Old Frontier Processor's vents are now relatively clear. Won't last longer than a few days, but we're going off lockdown for now."

01:58 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:58 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

01:58 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:58 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

01:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Defensive Dissidence! Welcome to home space!"

01:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:58 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] Lily Kaise cheers.

01:58 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 581" has launched from New Earth.

01:59 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 581" has jumped out of the sector.

01:59 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:59 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (5, 14, 12)

01:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Defensive Dissidence. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:59 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:59 Your ship 'Defensive Dissidence' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:00 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:00 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:00 Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! Old Frontier Station in Frontier Cluster is once again cleansed of Bari for a few more days. Enjoy a drink in the Star Lounge, a few Starship Upgrades and the best Asteroid Mining available to AEU Pilots.. Thanks to Ather Jammoa and others who performed this unsightly work! Fly safely! and fight hard on the ground! [01:00  8 March 2318 GST]

02:13 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.
(You are sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.)

02:13 You're already sitting.

Well, I hope you still love me after you read this. I don't wish to make this a public spectacle, but I should tell you before Evenia decides to say something. As I feared, according to her, I did flirt back and cheat on you. She hasn't said anything to anyone about it so she says, but if she does talk.... I'm afraid she's going to make me look very bad, bad enough that you may want to walk away from me. I promise that I have always loved you and I will always only love you.

19:57 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "An accord."

20:08 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

20:22 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "That sector is clear now."

20:22 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What is."

20:22 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "One of the reaches from my mission."

20:22 [Tactical Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Jameson's reach."

20:22 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Does it have anything to do with istanbul? Oh ok."

20:23 [Tactical Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Or what ever it was."

20:26 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Xenological Battery-Powered Temporary Station at Exploration Waypoint 52179 is now on emergency power.

20:45 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Interalliance."

20:45 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings politely as it receives a new notice.

21:08 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

21:26 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Xenological Battery-Powered Temporary Station at Exploration Waypoint 52179 is shutting down.

22:27 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

22:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

22:27 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Storage Room]

22:27 You see an ammunition storage box here.
You can go up.

You can go down and out.

22:27 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

22:27 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Hank, why don't you do it."

22:27 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Or Eve."

22:27 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Not long enough arms."

22:27 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "No."

22:27 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "I'm trying to be serious."

22:27 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield laughs.

22:28 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Run for voice, no don't want it."

22:28 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield sighs.

22:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Because in this case, names aren't needed if you pay attention."

22:28 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Then we're stuck with what we've got."

22:28 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm honestly not afraid of naming names. However, I'm also not interested in the drama when the names are named, as it were, because those people would immediately try to defend their actions and justify themselves by saying they're not elitest even though they definitely are."

22:29 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well yeah. That's kinda how I see it too. Ather. I'd name names all day. But woo. Drama. Whining. Bitching...Fuck that."

22:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have no idea what you're referring to Constantine as I so rarely bother with the drama on General. It's generally useless self-promotion."

22:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire laughs.

22:29 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

22:29 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Oh, I'd jus' say, whatever and call bullshit when I see it. 'nough said. Who cares about the drama."

22:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "So so so true."

22:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise laughs.

22:29 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "I am elite at eating food. But elite elsewise, nope."

22:29 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Even if you provide solid evidence of the fact, they will still go out of their way to deny it and vilify those who dared to defy them."

22:29 You glance at your communicator's screen.

22:29 There is one headline.

22:29 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Mmhmm."

22:29 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "You'll see."

22:29 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Mark me the villain! I want a cape though. I need to at least look good."

22:29 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "When you've been a pilot for as long as I have, you'll start to care about the drama, because it'll just give you a massive fucking headache."

22:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "So just turned it on and seems this mayfield gal is getting a lot of air time."

22:30 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Oh, uh... good point."

22:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah."

22:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I haven't been one as long as you, but I don't think any of us have. The drama already gives me a headache. I think I'll be asking for a replacement by the time I've been a pilot as long as you."

22:30 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Usually, those people will eventually tear them selves to shreds, with minimal effort from yourself."

22:30 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "You just have to be clever."

22:30 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A replacement head?"

22:31 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "This can be done."

22:31 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "I saw Ather on the news. Doesn't he got like robot bits already?"

22:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yes. A replacement head."

22:31 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield laughs.

22:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "This is why I don't like the drama on General and why I generally don't participate."

22:31 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Yes he does."

22:31 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Hmmm, statue head."

22:31 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Replacement head, promisin' I guess."

22:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Or whose ass can I suck up today?"

22:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise chuckles.

22:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire laughs.

22:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Constantine, it's time to buy another clipper."

22:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can't do it."

22:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Wow damn that sounded just... weonr more like who can I suck up to today more accurately."

22:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I owe money all over town."

22:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Haven't you heard?"

22:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, more like who's ass can I kiss up to today."

22:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "This makes me so painfully sad my eyes would tear up, if I cried."

22:33 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:33 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "WHat is the matter?"

22:33 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am glorious multi-tasker. I am being diplomatic while setting up an asteroid mining site."

22:33 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hello all."

22:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yesh in secret Callsea totally in secret with your affairs and bullshit."

22:34 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I want to go fuck up outsiders in a clipper because clippers are fucking glorious, and Constantine can't get one. Also hi Shule."

22:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm going to have half my debt paid off today."

22:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone cheers.

22:34 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Heya."

22:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily cheers for Constantine

22:34 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No, flares are even better."

22:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire cheers for Constantine Stone!

22:34 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup the Flare is the boss."

22:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "As soon as Unreality pays me, that is."

22:35 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh, I'm still a real fan of the clipper, to be honest."

22:35 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They're nice. Yes. But I'll always adore the clipper. Love 'em to bits."

22:35 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The Flare is only OK when you have two people on it, but the clipper owns with just one person."

22:35 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That's true."

22:36 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, in any rate. There are a few clippers around."

22:36 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "I have always seen them flyin' wings and I think they're pretty nice. Want one some day."

22:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But one is the SEAS clipper, which I have keys to."

22:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'll always prefer the flare."

22:36 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Guess who needs to upgrad his?"

22:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So there are beacons in your future."

22:36 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was going to say, you guys have an awesome fucking ship yourselves."

22:36 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup we have a few Clippers amongst us and amongst our organizations."

22:36 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can't help but giggle at people who whine about grid on clippers though. A good engineer and gunner who isn't an idiot, and you don't have an issue."

22:37 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The wing is the heavy corvette thing, right?"

22:37 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "No."

22:37 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Alas, I've never seen one."

22:37 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Destroyer."

22:37 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which one has weapon rooms in multiple rooms but is a three-person ship for you guys?"

22:37 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "It's got so many turrets looks like a flyin' porcupine and it's nifty."

22:37 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Wing."

22:37 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's the flying wing."

22:37 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Flying wing."

22:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "She's a destroyer. Pilot engineers and flies, and 2 dedicated gunners."

22:37 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's what I thought!"

22:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah the Wing has two weapons rooms and pilot does engineering and flying."

22:38 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's an amazing ship right there."

22:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yep, I've flown one a couple of times."

22:38 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "One of the best ships we have, in my opinion."

22:38 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh that's awesome."

22:38 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Ask Keegan."

22:38 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I concur with this accurate assessment."

22:38 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield laughs.

22:38 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I love mine to bits. She's awesome. Also I love engineering and flying together so."

22:38 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Didn't you tell me once about a ship with a gun in the engineering room, Eve?"

22:38 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Me, too."

22:39 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "My two favorite positions."

22:39 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "The heavy corvette is missile corvette. I think you meant that."

22:39 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And hi Eve."

22:39 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's the Juno, Constantine."

22:39 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Mutuality ship."

22:39 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

22:40 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No no. I meant the morningstar. I have one. You have weapons in engineering as well."

22:40 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh right."

22:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Later I want to run clipper beacons."

22:40 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah the Juno is fun! I've flown in Pierre's a long time ago when we went after Pirates during one of the Artifacting trips awhile bakc."

22:40 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Rather gunned he did the flying!"

22:41 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "There is something beautiful about repairing while you're shooting things."

22:42 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine cackles!

22:42 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield sighs.

22:42 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Well, rpeorters did a fairly accurate job? I mean I like expeditions jus' not...ugh anyway. Close enough."

22:42 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "This fringe headline. Ahahahahahah."

22:42 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "It's only partially true."

22:42 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "But sums up our discontent nicely."

22:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could do some later. I haven't done a beacon in ages."

22:43 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "I mean the other day people were sayin' they didn't wanna go on it because somethin' somethin' people are jerks, yata yata."

22:43 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

22:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire cheers.

22:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We should do org clipper beacons."

22:43 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "So I guess it depends on how you put it in perspective."

22:43 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Just for nonfringers."

22:43 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Civilian Fleet Loudly Speak Out Against Deep Space Exploration, Criticizing Voice Moreau's Presence on Coreward Trip."

22:43 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Just so you know, Hawthorn, we do not hate exploration. We just hate not having our voice around."

22:43 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Trust me. People that are jerks, become completely fucking impossible when you can't actually get away from them, and you're stuck on a ship for however long."

22:43 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Too true."

22:44 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Eh, people in general are pretty great at bein' disappointin' so I guess I don't care all that much where you're at in relationship to 'em."

22:44 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You know, I relaly like his outlook."

22:44 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think he's one of my new favorite cadets."

22:44 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "Hey!"

22:44 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup if you don't like them prior to leaving you will totally not like them moreso upon return so just avoid that stuff! I'm glad I didn't go with this crew even though I am concerned about the condiiton of the aquarium."

22:45 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield laughs.

22:45 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No worries, Lily. They wouldn't have let you go anyways."

22:45 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "This is why I carefully consider the jerk-factor that will be on a trip, before I decide if I go. I consider it, and factor in the confined quarters, and how fast jerk status will rise to complete fuckhead."

22:45 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That's good no heartache on my part heh."

22:45 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "I...meant more like I'd just go and say fuck the irritatin' folks."

22:45 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "You guys put so much consideration into it!"

22:46 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I would have turned them down if they would have offered me a berth on all my terms!"

22:46 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "I just would've went. Like who cares if they're fuckin' ridiculous. Let 'e m be ridiculous and then just move on."

22:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Why would they have not let you go, Lily?"

22:47 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aa, so naive. It's almost refreshing, but not quite."

22:47 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hey. There's very detailed math to my factoring for if I'll be able to go on a trip without punching someone."

22:47 [General Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Fuck politics, move on. Bluntly beat the dipshits with sledgehammers and be done with it."

22:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "They wouldn't have allowed anyone from aEU. Perhaps Ather but not any of us."
