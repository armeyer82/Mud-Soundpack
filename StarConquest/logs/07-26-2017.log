00:07:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh."

00:07:50 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "A few was a lot less than I expected, if you got more I'm int."

00:08:06 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "He said, right, beacons, so I said he'd have to short crew, starboard only."

00:10:51 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "So all that volunteered was me and general apathy?"

00:11:07 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yup. Not enough interest it seems."

00:42:28 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Cool. Well I'll poke at them then. If I need it. Or just to make the work faster."

00:43:38 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That also means I can make one of them go on the seekers spares ship, rather than me. I'm in."

00:43:47 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Full Dive". The organization has earned 1,640,728.82 credits.

00:50:17 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:50:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Space Market.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

Notice from the Space Defense Captain: As of this writing, all AEU sectors are clear of threats. The fighter beacon contest is now over! Eli came in first with 6 ships and Evangeline came in second with 5. Great job, guys! Even though the contest is over, remember that in this current political climate it's more important than ever that we all be capable of mounting a competent defense of home space. Try to a do a fighter beacon now and again to keep your skills sharp. [17:55 25 July 2317 GST]

00:53:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have a good night!"

00:53:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:53:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Have a good nap Evangeline."

00:54:37 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:54:38 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:54:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:54:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:54:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:54:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Right, I've got some debts to pay off. Time to make some credits!"

00:54:58 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:57:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Feed 'em both barrels!"

00:57:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Actually heavies might be a pain in the cargo hauler."

00:57:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Rock their stupid mechanical faces!"

00:57:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if you're in a fighter or flitter a single torpedo should ruin them."

00:58:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, yeah in the cargo hauler probably not the best idea. If you navigate out of the sector you should be fine. And they'll probably leave rather quickly after that."

01:15:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

01:15:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow more headlines."

01:15:57 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:16:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Basically. He hid himself in a nest so we couldn't see him. We stood there for almost an hour, waiting for the nest to dry out. Then suddenly, out he pops. We both said "You sneaky little bastard" right at the same time, so that's what he got named. We didn't realize he was a telepathic felo till way later. We just knew he was super different."

01:16:57 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

01:17:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a metallic gold touch einrophone from a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster.

01:22:21 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

01:22:25 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:24:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm convinced he is a pathological lyer just like Tatiana."

01:24:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:25:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I have mail so are you ok to go over to New Earth so I can fetch it Love?"

01:25:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well ok nothing heard..."

01:25:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

01:26:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

01:26:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:26:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:26:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:26:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:26:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:26:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:26:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:26:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:26:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:26:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:26:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:26:36 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:26:37 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

01:26:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:26:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:26:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:26:41 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:26:44 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

01:26:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:26:48 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

01:26:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:26:54 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:27:01 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

01:27:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:27:05 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:27:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:27:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:27:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:27:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

01:27:24 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:27:26 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:27:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident places a metallic gold touch einrophone into a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster.

01:27:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Be right back love."

01:27:44 You say, "Ok."

01:27:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:27:46 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:27:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.
Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters after Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:27:49 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:27:57 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

01:30:48 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

03:43:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well the only thing I foresee is once we've severed ties with Accord, that we'll likely be the target of Outsiders and Ifs. Other than that Love what do you foresee?"

03:44:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If Vernos goes belly up I personally don't want to wait around for that."

03:45:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I am curious what do you foresee that I don't? Best is just going to continue to make grandios statements."

03:45:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps you could then convince me to stay behind."

03:47:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd like to know your thoughts Love as I don't see much changing until the split with accord."

03:48:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just fucking drama."

03:48:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

03:48:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hehi suppose if I left you though you might find another woman."

03:49:49 You say, "I'm not going to find another woman."

03:50:12 Lily says to you, "You could! You're nice, handsome and rich!"

03:50:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

03:50:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "And you have a cruiser!"

03:50:34 You say, "I don't want anyone else but you."

03:50:49 Lily says to you, "Well I sure don't want anyone else but you either."

03:50:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:51:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd probably miss you so much if I went off without you that I probably just won't go."

03:51:25 You say, "And if indeed we do become the targets of outsiders and IFS, then I need to work closely with the new pilots like Constantine to help get them ready for that day."

03:51:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it's not going to happen for quite awhile."

03:52:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I say it's likely the case in about six months not 10-12 days."

03:52:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I say once the ties are severed with Accord who won't be there to bolster the AEU Navy."

03:53:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Notwithstanding their diplomatic prowess."

03:53:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So we're going to sit around and wait for quite awhile."

03:54:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "May be moot anyway because she may have no room left."

03:54:08 You say, "Well, some of the new pilots may need six months to get their skills up to flying and such."

03:54:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs at you.

03:56:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well there would still be time and after the ties are severed, I may not be able to use the QE and other things so exploration may become difficult. They may turn off the Extra-Long range NDB and such."

03:56:09 You ask, "And how would I find a woman in like 10 to 12 days while you're gone on this trip?"

03:56:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh it's been done..."

03:56:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I won't go."

03:56:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Unless you do."

03:56:44 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:56:51 You say to Lily, "I only want you."

03:57:12 Lily says to you, "Honestly Hun there's still time for a trip like this. In three months I would be hesitant."

03:58:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ather and Eli i'm not sure can go so they sure would help any new pilots we have like Tara."

03:59:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok then if she writes back saying we can go, then i'll tell her we're not."

03:59:51 You say, "That's assuming Ather doesn't shoot down Vernos and lose his license or something."

04:00:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well he can still teach people in a sim."

04:00:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Eli is a very good pilot too and I know he will."

04:00:54 You say, "Eli's going to be busy doing more broadcasts, which could make him face even more consequences."

04:01:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well you can what iff all night. I guess you just don't want to be with me."

04:01:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

04:01:37 You say, "It has nothing to do with not being with you."

04:01:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Eli is a gifted pilot and I know he will help."

04:02:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Besides, the broadcast is not what got him rogued."

04:02:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The lies about the trip got him rogued."

04:02:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or the alleged stolen parts and the inference concerning pirates and the Mutuality."

04:03:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Otherwise, he would have just been called a silly name as we have."

04:03:51 You say, "Right, so he does another broadcast. They can't remove him from office again. Who knows what Best is capable of doing now."

04:04:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Anyway Love, we haven't had a fight in months and I don't want to. I just believe you're dragging your feet for unfounded reasons. As I say nothing major is going to happen until the ties are severed. Then Katie bar the door unfortunately."

04:05:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So a trip isn't going to hurt."

04:05:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I won't do any trading."

04:05:29 You say, "I don't want to fight either. I just want to be here for my alliance in case I'm needed."

04:05:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh our alliance has already told us they don't need us."

04:05:57 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

04:06:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "They removed us from office isn't that a big enough of a statement?"

04:06:35 You say, "But they haven't taken our licenses."

04:07:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well as I say all that is going to occur is Best is going to continue with his egoistic statements. Vernos may get his butt kicked and otherwise, it will be business as usual."

04:07:59 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

04:48:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:48:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

06:00:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay. They're not too bad, one or two torpedoes should do the trick. Do you have an ammunition box in your fighter full of torpedoes?"

06:00:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They do hit a little harder, so be sure to check your damage readout frequently."

06:00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I have a set of twenty torpedos in an ammo box, yup."

06:26:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What kind of ship would be good for exploring deep space?"

06:27:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The exploration scout! It's great for that."

06:27:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are a couple things that make exploration much easier though, the most important being an autovector unit."

06:28:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think you can get that at 300 industry."

06:28:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's a long ways to go. Whats it do?"

06:28:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It lets you set a course for your ship, and then the ship will just move in that straight line across sector edges."

06:29:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Without it you have to move to the edge of a sector, switch to manual control, move across the boundary, switch back, etc."

06:29:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I started exploring before I had one, and it gets tiring really quickly."

06:29:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are two really good books by Ather in the bookstore."

06:29:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll pick them up and mail them to you."

06:31:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:31:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It can be tough to get those first 300 points, but there are a couple tricks."

06:31:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The space vermin patrol always needs people to salvage bari corpses."

06:32:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's a really good source of points."

06:32:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "All the activities we can do as pilots give you some kind of balance between money and points."

06:32:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Salvaging gives you the most points."

06:33:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you're going to salvage, always transfer your salvage at the processor in The Belt of Orion."

06:33:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

06:33:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Why there?"

06:33:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I've been coming to new earth to transfer."

06:34:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are some stations out in space that are maintained by pilots. You typically get more money for transferring to them, due to tax breaks."

06:34:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can also do ground work for industry points on Teslaworld."

06:34:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It doesn't give as many as salvaging, but if you're getting tired of salvaging it can be a nice change of pace."

06:35:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hauling asteroids is another activity that still gives a decent amount of points, though it's more skewed towards money."

06:36:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Lots of options. Its hard to pick."

06:36:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but it's a good thing."

06:36:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Try to try a bunch of different things, you might find something you really like."

06:36:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The space vermin salving missions are probably the easiest points for now."

06:36:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Got six cores saved up."

06:36:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Salvaging, sorry."

06:37:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice! Those are worth points too."

06:37:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Anybody fancy a nest?"

06:37:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or you know, whatever?"

06:39:02 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

06:40:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you ever find yourself poking around the bookstore, there's this one book, Moose's Big Book of Industry, that explains a lot about everything we can."

06:40:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do."

06:41:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I already have a copy of that book!"

06:41:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It's been a big help."

06:41:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh cool!"

06:41:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah I still use that a lot."

06:41:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I use the ones I sent you a lot too."

06:41:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm actually pretty new myself."

06:41:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

06:42:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im going to need a bookshelf at this rate."

06:42:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh they're out there."

06:42:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure where exactly."

06:42:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I think I own all the active writers currently."

06:42:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got mine at the The Calm, but I don't love it."

06:42:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Took two book cases."

06:43:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow."

06:44:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I am thinking of upgrading some of the salvaging gear on my hauler."

06:44:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a good idea to keep that stuff upgraded."

06:44:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In my opinion, the most important piece is the scanner."

06:44:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Being able to see more chunks at once is huge, especially when you're looking for specific things."

06:44:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like in the SVPC missions."

06:45:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Other than that, strength is good to have on your grapple."

06:45:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The stronger the grapple, the faster chunks break apart."

06:47:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, my ships should be a bit more comfortable now..without falling down."

06:47:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

06:47:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's always good."

06:47:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, Eli!"

06:48:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you have a minute?"

06:48:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm just doing some courier jobs."

06:48:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm on the clock, but I'm taking a break on Ardsley to have some ice cream."

06:48:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

06:49:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Would you mind coming to meet me? I want to pick your brain about defense strategy."

06:49:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What kind of ice cream?"

06:49:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Strawberry!"

06:49:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a truck that goes around here."

06:50:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That is.. acceptable. But bubblegum is the best."

06:50:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

06:50:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This guy doesn't have that, sadly."

06:55:03 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

07:03:03 Mischief the large black felo bats at a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker.

07:11:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Where was it I should transfer my salvage?"

07:11:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The processing station in The Belt of Orion."

07:13:26 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Thanos". The organization has earned 118,797.85 credits.

07:18:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "My grapple doesn't seem to be working too well on this debris.."

07:18:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Out in Orion?"

07:18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "A-14."

07:18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm."

07:18:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, when you hit the debris button to use the debris scanner."

07:19:04 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

07:19:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What grade does it say the chunks are?"

07:19:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll need a grapple of at least that grade to salvage the chunks effectively."

11:51:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, an insulated purple cooler, an insulated blue cooler, a pair of leather thong sandals with a white flowered print, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.

11:52:40 [Starship "William Dove"; Shower]

11:52:40 This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You can go out.

11:52:50 You push a small button, starting the shower. Hot water begins to pour over your skin. You feel cleaner already.

11:57:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:57:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

11:57:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:57:45 The ship is already moving.

11:57:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:57:47 Which sector did you mean?

11:57:47

11:58:45 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:58:46 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

11:58:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

11:58:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

11:59:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

11:59:02 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:59:03 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

You can go south and out.

11:59:19 [Starship "Misty Justice"; Control Room]

11:59:19 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

11:59:40 You are carrying nothing.

11:59:42 [Starship "Misty Justice"; Airlock]

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

12:00:00 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:00:00 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

12:00:02 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:00:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

12:00:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:00:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:00:12 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:00:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

12:00:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:00:27 The ship is already moving.

12:00:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:00:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:00:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:00:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:00:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:00:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:00:36 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

12:05:25 Hi Tamra,
Thanks so much for the other day. You were amazing. I looked for you later to run some beacons, but you were already asleep. Anyways, two things. Remember, don't talk to anyone about what we did the other day and two, if you'd like me to look after your felo, send me a key to your ship and let me know. I'd be more than happy to. Take care and kisses.

12:14:39 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

12:14:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:14:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:14:59 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

12:15:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

12:15:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:15:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:15:19 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:15:22 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:15:22 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:15:36 You remove a starship requisition application from a leather briefcase.

12:15:41 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

12:15:42 
2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?

8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issues missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?

9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?

10. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?

11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?

12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?

13. You must choose a theme song that you will completely rock out to while fighting. What song do you choose?

12:15:54 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

12:17:00 You put a starship requisition application in a leather briefcase.

12:17:01 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:17:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

12:17:03 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

12:17:03 You can go out and enter into the ship.

12:17:05 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

12:17:06 I don't understand that.

12:17:08 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

12:17:08 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a bulky silver-colored posterizer here.
You can go south and out.

12:17:15 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident.

13:58:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:58:55 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:58:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:58:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:58:58 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:59:03 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

13:59:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

13:59:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:59:09 The ship is already moving.

13:59:12 The ship is already moving.

13:59:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:59:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:59:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:59:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

13:59:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:59:21 You're already sitting.

13:59:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:59:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:59:22 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

13:59:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:59:33 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:59:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

15:29:07 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

15:46:21 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit". The organization has earned 375,249.33 credits.

15:49:36 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chirps quietly as it receives a new notice.

15:53:12 You glance at your communicator's screen.

15:53:12 You have one mail message.

15:53:19 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:53:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:53:20 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:53:23 You peer out...

15:53:23 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

15:53:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:53:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:53:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:53:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:53:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:53:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

15:53:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:53:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:53:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:53:44 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:53:45 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

15:53:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:53:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:53:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:53:50 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:53:51 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

15:53:51 --
AutoStar (general-purpose starship autopilot) Version 9.1
--
Destinations in this sector:

   Planets:
[1] New Earth                                               
   Space Stations:

--

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:53:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

15:53:52 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

15:53:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:54:07 The ship's current engine speed is 8000 km/s.

15:54:07 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 12.0 seconds.

15:54:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:54:17 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:54:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

15:54:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:54:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:54:32 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

15:54:34 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:54:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:54:35 You scramble to your feet.

15:54:35 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

15:54:35 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

15:54:36 You can't go that way.

15:54:37 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

15:54:37 You see a trash can and a long white plasteel bench here.
You can go east and west.

15:54:38 [New Earth; Spaceport East]
You can go northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, and west.

15:54:39 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

15:54:40 You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

15:54:41 [New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room]

15:54:42 You see Fabious the arachnoid security robot here.
You can go northwest and down.

15:54:42 The postal machine informs you that you have mail waiting.  After some movements coming from the back room, the conveyor belt coming from the wall swiftly brings forth a small package. You quickly grab it off the belt.

15:55:06 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

15:55:08 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

15:55:08 You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

15:55:08 [New Earth; Spaceport East]
You can go northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, and west.

15:55:08 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

15:55:09 You see a trash can and a long white plasteel bench here.
You can go east and west.

15:55:09 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

15:55:09 You can't go that way.

15:55:10 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

15:55:10 You can go up.

15:55:12 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

15:55:13 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

15:56:15 a small package

15:56:15 This is a package. It is addressed to Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident, and was sent by Tamra Swenson.
It is closed.
You open a small package.
Inside it you see an "Effervescent Zephyr" key.

15:58:24 You remove an "Effervescent Zephyr" key from a small package.

15:58:29 You toss your package in a nearby garbage can.

15:58:35 I see no "keyring" here.

15:58:40 You slide an "Effervescent Zephyr" key onto a keychain.

Note: Not all spaceports possess the starship locator function.

16:03:00 I don't understand that.

16:03:02 I don't understand that.

16:03:04 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:03:04 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:03:05 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:03:06 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:03:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:03:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:03:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:03:21 The ship is already moving.

16:03:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:03:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:03:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:03:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

16:03:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:03:28 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 572" has jumped out of the sector.

16:03:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:03:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:03:31 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:03:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

16:03:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:03:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:03:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:03:36 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:03:38 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

16:03:39 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

16:03:39 --
AutoStar (general-purpose starship autopilot) Version 9.1

Destinations in this sector:

   Planets:
[1] Chetumal                                                
   Ships (present location):

--

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:03:39 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

16:03:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:03:44 Via general sector communication, Vortex Industries 855 transmits a text-based transmission: "hiya good flying"

16:03:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:03:54 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:03:55 The computer reports that the one-person skimmer "Vortex Industries 855" has jumped out of the sector.

16:03:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

16:03:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:04:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:04:12 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:04:13 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:04:15 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:04:15 You peer out...

16:04:15 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

16:04:44 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

16:04:53 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

16:04:53 You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:04:54 You exit the ship.

16:04:54 [Chetumal Spaceport; Garage]
You can go up and down.

Subject: Temporary Absence - Going to Feng wo and Various
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 16:37 26 July 2317 GST

Hello Everyone,
I am leaving for Feng Wo this evening at around 20:00. for perhaps
a week or more.
Therefore, this will be a good opportunity for you to get some
practice in Temporary Space Station Building. I will be describing
stations which are maintained in the next Messages so please work
with the organizations indicated or as specified, if you are
unable to find their parts as designated. If you aren't available
to build a station such as the Asteroid Processor in Alpha 285, at
least just after it goes offline, please reach out for help but
not at the last hour or it will likely cause a considerable delay.
LIBS is a good organization to reach out to or Starseekers for the
Asteroid Processor in Alpha 285. As for the Artifact Alpha 777
project, then reach out and coordinate with LIBS as you see that
there is a day or two remainig on the life span of a related
Temporary Space Station. Please check the Range Office at least
every other day and be certain to check for those Temporary Space
Stations which are within 24 hours of their life span.
To contribute or obtain Modules from SEAS, if Johann or Evenia
requests a Module from SEAS, then meet them on Accord at the Module
Requisition shop and purchase the Module and have it loa
18:42:33 ded aboard
whichever Module Transporter is specified. SEAS has Member
Megacredits specified for this purpose.

Subject: Temporary Space Station Building Tips
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 16:41 26 July 2317 GST
--
Hello Everyone,
,
Regarding Temporary Space Station building, please take the time to
go over to Accord and then up to the next level ramp from Doc 4.
If you go to the left and then straight ahead, you will see the
Modules Requisition shop. Please learn about the categories -
Core, Power Plant, Top and Side Modules. I know that this will
initially appear to be a bit complex. However, over time, you will
become more familiar with the various Temporary Space Station
Modules and their respective functionality.
Special notes --
If you do not possess keys to starships indicated in the breakdown
of a Temporary Space Station, then ask shule or myself to provide
you with or to loan you a key. If you are assigned to maintain a
given Temporary Space Station or stations, then you won't have to
return keys.
Now for tips on Temporary Space Station Building --
- you will find Modules scattered about on different Module
Transporters. This is because it isn't convenient for
organizations to report to Accord per each instance that a Module
or Modules are required. Therefore, we try to maintain extra
Modules for our respective contributions. for SEAS, I am currently
storing them aboard my own Module Transporter, 'Building Capital'
and will be purchasing SEAS own Module Transporter if not at this
posting or at sometime in the future.
- Transferring Modules to other Starships such as to 'Herding
cats' - simply board the Module Transporter where the desired
Module is and proceed to the Bay. Attach a lifter to the module
desired or Lifters to Modules. Then proceed up to the control
Room, power up, launch and then press the 'BAY' button which will
open the Module bay Door. Next be certain to wear a full spacesuit
and proceed to the Module Bay. Next push each Lifter out which
has an attached Module. Go out of the Module Bay and detach each
lifter and push each empty Lifter out to the bay door. Finally,
reenter the Module bay, go up and into the Control Room. Press
the 'BAY' button to close the Bay door and land on Doc 4. Repeat
this process by going to all desired Module Transporters to obtain
desired Modules. After you have pushed all of the necessary
Modules out into the sector that are required to build a Temporary
Space Station, then enter 'Herding Cats', launch and salvage the
modules from the sector. Be certain to check the Module Bay to
verify that you have obtained all of the desired modules you need.
- Building a Temporary Space Station - This is a bit tedious
particulary if there are a number of other Modules already stored
on the Constructor 'Herding Cats'. I try to discourage others from
putting too many Cores, Tops and things on there but it's likely
not going to happen. These extra modules will likely be eventually
moved out though to facilitate easier assembly.
- now, consult the list of Module for a given Temporary Space
Station. Go to the Bay and pull one each, a hose and a power cord
from their respective reels.
Note where the Core is that you want to attach to. Unless a
Temporary Space Station is already built in the Constructor, the
last core should be the last Core out of all available Cores. Be
very careful that the Core is for the correct organization.
Next, note the other Modules you will need to construct a given
Temporary Space Station. Although there is no particular order in
which to connect up their air and power, it's good practice to
observe order for completeness. You might want to start with the
power plant, then Side Modules and then the Top but random
attaching is prone to cause one to miss necessary Modules.
To attach a Module, attach one end of a hose to the desired Module
and then the other end to the desired Core. Repeat this process
with the Power Cord. Next, pull one each a Hose and a Power Cord
from their respective reels and repeat this process until all
desired Modules are attached to the desired Core.
- Temporary Space Station Construction --
go back to the Control room. Power up, Launch and press the 'BAY'
button to open the Bay door. Return to the Module Bay with your
spacesuit on and COMBINE each Module except the Core to be included
in the desired Te
18:47:47 mporary Space Station.
Finally, once all desired Modules but Core are assembled, then
Combine the Core which will produce a fully assembled Temporary
Space Station.
The last step is to travel to the point of deployment. open the
Bay Door and enter the Module Bay fully spacesuited. Press the
'USE' lever on the core of the desired Temporary Space Station and
wait for its deployment. If the Temporary Space Station has an AEU
core, you will hear an announcement over the AEU Sector Status
Channel. Otherwise, a message will be received via the
organization's notification service that it has contributed to the
specified Temporary Space Station.
If you need any clarifications, please ask anyone in SEAS who has
experience with Temporary Space Station Building.

18:48:09 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

18:48:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slumps in a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it and goes to sleep.

18:49:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

18:49:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

18:50:27 Logged out of FTL Message Board Net.

18:50:58 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Organizations/Space Explorers Amidst The Stars/General.

18:51:32 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

18:51:36 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

18:51:43 You say to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, "I'm going to miss you."

18:51:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

18:52:29 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

18:52:44 Lily says to you, "I will so miss you too but since I don't have any new pilots to teach flying to, just waiting aorund here for Best to continue his dribble and news isn't going to accomplish much."

18:53:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We will hear news from here while out there whether we want it or not."

18:53:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll be honest love, I was almost tempted not to return."

18:54:11 You say, "Awww, then I'd really miss you."

18:54:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I guess that's how it is."

18:54:49 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

18:55:04 You ask, "You will come bac, right?"

18:55:09 You say, "Come back."

18:55:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Maybe."

18:55:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It just depends on how I feel before they are ready to return."

18:55:52 Shule nods sadly.

18:55:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll probably try to dock my Capsule and I will take Asteria with me."

18:56:09 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

18:56:30 You ask, "What about all of your felo and such?"

18:56:43 You say, "I'll do my best to take care of them."

18:56:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If I don't come back in 30 days, please get rid of the felo in Star Kittens, Daisy May and Flying Cat."

18:57:14 You sigh. "Ok."

18:57:31 You say, "I feel like you're leaving me."

18:57:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As for the pets in here, then you may keep them or find good homes for them as well as my fish and Higgins."

18:57:54 You ask, "So, is this the end of our relationship then?"

18:58:32 You frown.

18:58:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No you're not coming with and it's not because I want not to be with you but I just want to run far far away from this fiasco."

18:59:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Anyway, please do not mention any of this to anyone."

18:59:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't want the AEU government knowing."

19:00:00 You say, "But if you don't return... I'll never see you again."

19:00:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I have not yet decided what I will do."

19:00:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I suppose if you bother to go to feng Wo Collective, you may find me."

19:01:12 You say, "I can't get there on my own. I don't even know where it is and I can't chart."

19:01:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well i'm sure someone else will eventually."

19:01:37 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

19:01:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

19:01:47 Shule holds you tight, not wanting to let go.

19:02:08 Lily holds onto you tightly hoping it won't be for the last time.

19:02:31 Shule looks away so you can't see the tears forming in the corners of his eyes.

19:02:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just hanging back here is like a slow death."

19:03:22 You say, "If you don't come back... I might just leave the corps."

19:04:09 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

19:05:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I wouldn't blame you love but I'd hope in the least you would come join me."

19:06:36 You say, "And how would I even find out there."

19:06:41 You ask, "Find you there?"

19:06:52 You say, "Feng wo collective is a big place."

19:07:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If you come to Feng Wo that is likely going to be where I will stay most of the time unless I go out exploring. I would eventually ocme back though unless I become lost."

19:07:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Come that is."

19:08:51 You frown.

19:09:00 You sigh.

19:09:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If the AEU pulls my license, then I dunno, I may yes become unregged and... well... I hope I don't end up in the wrong clan."

19:09:40 You sigh. "I feel like this is good-bye forever."

19:09:53 "I love you!" You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

19:14:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The SVPC sells a nifty gadget called an anomaly detector or something like that."

19:14:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sec there's a dead fishie."

19:14:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It makes your computer ping when it sees a probe in the sector."

19:15:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh please look in ever so often and you could obviously have the eggs."

19:15:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident opens a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

19:15:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

19:15:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It was a bit pricy, then again, im still getting used to the sheer amount of credits im exchanging regularly."

19:15:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, you'll have plenty enough to buy smaller stuff like that soon enough."

19:16:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "We all had to get u sed to that, for sure." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "Give it time and you'll be tosing around millions on a whim."

19:16:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd grab it for you, but I'm far away from home space right now."

19:16:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

19:35:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You should probably ignore it."

19:35:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though if you think you can take the defenders in the sector, by all means grab their cores."

19:35:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Be careful if you're out in uncharted space though."

19:35:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It just popped up on my sensors a bit ago. There was some probes around but I took care of them."

19:36:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome!"

19:37:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it can be a bit dangerous, sure."

19:37:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm.. yes. fun. You'll find that many of us have become adrenine junkies."

19:37:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:37:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It could be a Science Vesel or a galleon."

19:37:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it's also kind of exciting."

19:37:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. arenline."

19:37:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But yeah, I've definitely broken limbs in botched nest attacks."

19:38:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I mean, space combat itself is somewhat terrifying and shocking, still. I'm getting the hang of it though."

19:39:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll get used to it."

19:39:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah.. You'll get used to folks talking like that eventually. well, mostly used to it. It still surprises me quite often."

19:39:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, they have a special ship they can use?"

19:39:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Instead of rented platforms?"

19:40:09 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

19:40:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "My heart was beating quite hard when I tried take those heavy fighters on, for example. I barely jumped out with my ship intact!"

19:40:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I know that feeling."

19:41:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A week or so ago I wrecked two fighters doing beacons."

20:58:07 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Cipactli? It's a scout."

20:58:37 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident has used 10 megacredits on a fission breeder reactor module and placed it aboard the four-person Accord space module transport "Libertarians Station Transport Alpha".

20:58:54 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Never mind."

20:58:55 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ted. I've seen people use...Um, our other scout. But I'm too not awake to think of it's name."

20:59:53 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Good shout, thanks."

21:00:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So Lily, just to clarify."

21:00:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes go ahead?"

21:00:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "We're responsible for the 285 asteroid processor, and all of the things listed in this alpha 777 post?"

21:01:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Gem is your best option. That,  piercer, or sightseer."

21:01:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And also the Olivia's Pearl scooping station."

21:01:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As I said in the post we work with LIBS on 777 but yes we are responsible for the Asteroid processor in 285 and so you would work with Starseekers if you don't have the time."

21:03:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Gotta love the fake news NEN."

21:04:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

21:05:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, the rest station has less than a day, but I don't see it on your list."

21:05:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "We don't worry about that?"

21:05:16 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It is on the list."

21:05:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay, sorry."

21:05:24 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sorry mis-com."

21:05:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It is on the list."

21:07:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I see it."

21:07:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I didn't note it verbatim but it is under rest/recharging station."

21:07:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I should build and deploy one of those when it goes on emergency power?"

21:07:46 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "League storage extender doesn't increase size, does it?"

21:07:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."

21:08:06 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Thanks."

21:08:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure thing."

21:08:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Preferably so as not to waste resources but if you can't be available, it's ok to do so a few hours ahead of time just always try to meet that approximate time. It's just the scooping station that is more finicky because you cannot put up another scoop until the current one expires."

21:09:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool. I think I can manage that."

21:09:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then it looks like 285 is up in two days."

21:09:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "If I can get both of those I'll be an expert at that point and should be able to figure out the rest."

21:16:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Correction,  the death of Masterson was not caused by the beam. Nonethless the two events are still linked."

21:17:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Masterson would not have had to make the sacrifice he made, had Grenwold not been destroyed by the Outsiders."

21:18:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eli, they're going to find fault no matter what."

21:19:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Still, it's better to try and get on top of it before they come back with a response."

You can go northeast, southeast, and up.

21:31:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The 3 last modules in Herding cats are for the rest/recharging station and there are already cores from SHIT or Nicolette's organization so don't use any other core but all of your modules for this station are loaded onto Herding Cats."

21:32:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay cool."

21:32:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't like saying or writing out that acrynym."

21:32:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

21:33:14 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:33:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

21:33:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

21:33:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

21:33:25 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:33:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident picks up a compact white refrigerator.

21:33:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:33:46 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

21:33:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:33:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:34:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:34:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Centauri Colony Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:34:08 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:34:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Colonial Gate."

21:34:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:34:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:34:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:34:15 Once a waystation between Old Earth and its newly settled colony, the Colonial Gate station is now largely irrelevant, but still stands guard here as a sort of watchtower.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:34:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Centauri Colony Orbit."

21:34:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:34:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:34:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:34:20 The Centauri Colony remains Old Earth's only remaining major extrasolar possession. The planet does not appear to be particularly teeming with life, with the color of the land fading from brownish grasses to grey bedrock.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Centauri in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:34:23 Via general sector communication, Centauri transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to Centauri Colony Orbit!"

21:34:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:34:33 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Centauri.

21:34:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:34:45 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:34:46 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:34:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:34:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:35:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:35:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

21:35:02 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:35:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

21:35:06 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:35:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

21:35:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

21:36:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

[Centauri Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Though pockmarks still litter the surface of the landing pad, things appear to be returning to normal. Most of the rusting hulks of ships have been cleared away, with only rust-colored stains left on the pavement. The spaceport to the north has been largely rebuilt, and stands shining white against the bright azure Centauri sky. To the south you can see vast, overgrown fields of grass stretching away behind blast barriers. Over the spaceport buildings the tallest of Outland City's structures are visible.
The one-person fighter "I Am A New Pilot", the one-person flitter "Hi There!", the two-person light transport "Return To Sender", the reconnaissance craft "Artifactor", the one-person fighter "Hypernova", the one-person fighter "Transporter", the one-person fighter "Ruthless", the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", and the luxury sightseer "Written In The Stars" are landed here.

21:43:15 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If I can just move her with my pets, sure. But I don't wanna need to keep going to another ship."

21:43:24 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's ok. I can go get her."

21:43:28 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "You have fifteen minutes."

21:43:33 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Good afternoon all."

21:43:39 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Roughly ten."

21:45:10 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay."

21:47:34 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:47:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

21:47:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives you a blue plastic food storage container.

21:47:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

21:47:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a black plastic tray of spider chow from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

21:47:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts down a black plastic tray of spider chow.

21:47:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident rips off the plastic seal covering a black plastic tray of spider chow.

21:47:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

21:50:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

21:51:21 Say to whom?

21:51:24 You peer out...

21:51:24 
[Centauri Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Though pockmarks still litter the surface of the landing pad, things appear to be returning to normal. Most of the rusting hulks of ships have been cleared away, with only rust-colored stains left on the pavement. The spaceport to the north has been largely rebuilt, and stands shining white against the bright azure Centauri sky. To the south you can see vast, overgrown fields of grass stretching away behind blast barriers. Over the spaceport buildings the tallest of Outland City's structures are visible.
The one-person fighter "I Am A New Pilot", the one-person flitter "Hi There!", the two-person light transport "Return To Sender", the reconnaissance craft "Artifactor", the one-person fighter "Hypernova", the one-person fighter "Transporter", the one-person fighter "Ruthless", and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.
You can go north.

21:51:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

21:51:32 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:51:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

21:51:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on your lap.

21:51:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

21:51:40 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:51:41 You say to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, "I love you and will so miss you!"

21:51:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

21:51:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:52:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

21:52:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:52:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok i'm going to get my capsule."

21:52:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:52:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:52:18 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:52:19 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

21:52:22 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:52:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:52:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:52:25 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:52:26 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

21:52:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:52:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:52:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:52:30 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:52:33 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

21:52:43 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:52:43 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

21:52:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I love you soo much and I will miss you. I will think hard about coming back. If anything, you are the reason why I would come back."

21:52:46 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:53:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

21:53:04 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

21:53:28 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:53:29 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:53:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Please work with Constantine on the stations? Hey it's about time you guys knew what I deal with!"

21:53:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:53:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:53:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

21:53:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:53:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

21:53:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:53:49 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:53:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from your lap.

21:53:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

21:54:01 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

21:54:04 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

21:54:10 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

21:54:23 Lily leans towards you and embraces you in a long and tender embrace.

21:54:32 Lily kisses you passionately.

21:54:32 Shule holds you tight, not wanting to let go.

21:54:45 Shule returns the kiss sadly, but passionately.

21:54:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Bye my love but it's not goodbye."

21:55:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

21:55:04 You say, "I feeel like it is. Good-bye and safe journeys."

21:55:15 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Lily Kaise, you've 5 minutes."

21:55:15 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

21:55:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Thank you don't be so sad Love."

21:55:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

21:55:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

21:55:28 You say, "Fair winds and following seas."

21:55:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Thank you my dearest Love."

21:55:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

21:55:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

21:55:57 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

21:56:08 Shule whispers, "Good bye my love.

21:56:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I love you and will love you forever."

21:56:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident whispers, "I love you."

21:56:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

21:56:28 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:56:32 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

21:56:39 There appear to be about 27 pilots recently active.

21:56:47 Your communicator reports that...

21:56:48 
At least one recently active pilot is relaxing at Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.
At least two recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

21:58:21 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "There is not room for that ship."

21:58:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Who?"

21:58:38 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "The capsule."

22:00:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:00:06 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Mel thanks."

22:00:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I had to undock my capsule love so jsut saying."

22:01:38 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I hope everybodyy's aboard."

22:01:41 Minor Change:

22:01:41 
Whether people are jostled in crowded control rooms now has more to do with who has actually recently been near the controls, though larger groups of people will continue to be an inconvenience regardless, depending on the size of the ship. Also, more commands will potentially result in jostling.

This means that, for example, a fighter cockpit becomes crowded very easily. However, a handful of people in the control room of a large ship will not cause issues unless multiple people are actually reaching for the controls around the same time.


22:01:42 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Wait."

22:01:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not yet."

22:02:10 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

22:09:00 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Please don't let anyone die."

22:09:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm getting there."

22:09:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:09:47 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Slippers, yes."

22:12:10 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

22:20:10 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

22:26:25 You scramble to your feet.

22:26:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, a personal hoverpallet, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and an insulated red sleeping bag here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
