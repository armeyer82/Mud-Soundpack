Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Observation Deck]
Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a soft cinnamon brown leather couch, an overstuffed aquamarine sofa, a
small purple trash bin, and a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt here.
Blake Madison is sleeping on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch. Alko Delovega
is sleeping on the floor. Tony Cross is sleeping on an overstuffed aquamarine
sofa.
Lily Kaise and Clarina Taylor are sitting on a soft cinnamon brown leather
couch. Simon Collins and Matteo Hapta are sitting on an overstuffed aquamarine
sofa. Ryan Thomas is standing here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.
(You are sitting on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.)
