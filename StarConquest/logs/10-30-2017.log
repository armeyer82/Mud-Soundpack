00:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Weeeeee."

00:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sounds like Katie is having just a little too much fun."

00:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I love this, it's kinda like skating."

00:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley laughs.

00:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Anyone know how many points I get new missions, tesla wise??"

00:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I was wondering the same thing, I've already got over 20 now."

00:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I got 24 currently."

00:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, solo missions, you don't really get new missions. It's more group missions that you get more access to."

00:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Wow, me too!"

00:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh so you have to be with others to unlock them?"

00:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "So they'll never assign me to a bigger site?"

00:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I think the cites get bigger, but it's always just the same, walking around a maze and digging. I thought I would be facing danger soon."

00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The only way to get to a bigger site is with other people. Some missions, like an archaeological site, require 250 gcp. I think."

00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I saw danger when I went with tamra and mike."

00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Oh, so that's what that guys problem is."

00:05 Kim Saunders yawns. "Hi."

00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "What guy."

00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey now. I don't have any problems."

00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "An archeologist who hangs out in the lounge sometimes."

00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Sure you do, you got me asa friend."

00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh that guy. I spoke to him and he said I couldn't help him."

00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Same here."

00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "He sounded worried about something."

00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "Sure it's not you with the problem of having me as a riend?'" Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

00:06 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I spoke with him too, I think he really oly talks to people in at least tier 2 battlesuits."

00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Friend."

00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I have little sympathy. He won't tell me what the problem is and let me judge, so stuff him."

00:06 You nod to Kim Saunders.

00:06 You say to Kim, "Hi!"

00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "How many points does it take for tier 2?"

00:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "125? I think? Or is that tier 1.5."

00:07 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Depends, for an AEU tier 2, 250 ground combat."

00:07 You grin at Kim Saunders.

00:07 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "For the rental the same. For suits from other alliances, hmm, can't remember."

00:07 Kim Saunders asks, "So, how are you?"

00:08 You say to Kim, "Doing great. You?"

00:08 Kim Saunders says, "Doing ok."

00:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh not too bad."

00:08 You smile at Kim Saunders.

00:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Not too bad! How many gcp you got."

00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "About 35 if I round up."

00:09 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "For those archeological sites you definitely need a group, usuall I think we go with no less than 6."

00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, it's a minimum of six."

00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I think I have a few more gcp than that."

00:09 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have seen it done with 5, but that personally made me crnge."

00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Interesting."

00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Sounds scary if you don't know what you're doing."

00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I really don't like doing them with only five."

00:10 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Instead of us seeking out the enemies, they come to seek us out while we defend the site."

00:10 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So it has the potential of getting quite chaotic."

00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly. And they're not very nice visitors."

00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I guess everyone tries to see what they can dig up and kill before leaving?"

00:11 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "There is nothing to dig up in arch sites."

00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh so just combat then."

00:12 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The archeologists, like the one who soetimes visit the lounge, are doing studies there, see what they can learn. But every now and then they get overrun and need help."

00:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh interesting."

00:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "So what does everyone do to get space combat points other than beacons."

00:14 Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

00:14 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, missions? In your case, from space vermin patrol?"

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I think you can get them from killing rats too."

00:14 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Or sometimes defend against invasions and sieges."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Yeah. Everyone raves about svp and I'm just... not feeling it."

00:15 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Why is that, Katie?"

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "They give me 5 missions, 1 is usually space combat, none are usually ground combat... they just feel lame."

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "So far the only one I've done is the rats pod mission. All the others, I haven't found enough rat parts or haven't tried."

00:15 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, it's just a case of try every day and see what they have on offer."

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I do the rats scouts all the time. And occasionally the bari corpse one. I usually do rats drills, but that's about it."

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Yeah katie, I love ground combat, I was disappointed to see that too."

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There will come a time when you can no longer do SVP or Low Deployments and you will wish you still could."

00:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "But lils, by then I'll be able to do beacons and nests, and I can gather everyone together and do propper stuff, one would think?"

00:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Well, from what I've seen, I think beacons would more than make up for it, plus nests and whatever else there is."

00:17 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The rats antennae you get from destroying rats in ground combat, so I think also in a rats nest? It's been a while since I did them."

00:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You can do that now in addition to SVP and Low Deployments."

00:17 You peer north...

00:17 
[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
The three-person clipper "Obliteration", the two-person Accord gemini "Starfish", the two-person flare "Deadly Strike", and the luxury sightseer "Speeding Eagle" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

00:17 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "To tell you the truth, if I could still do svp missions, I would, even if I did not get a single point or credit for it."

00:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Yeah, only when you or shule or similar run them though."

00:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Whereas later you won't be able to so you'll just have beacons and Nstes and so on and that is dependent on who wants to participate when you can do those other missions at will."

00:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi love."

00:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi love."

00:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Where might you be hiding?"

00:20 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

00:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Don't underestimate the value of what you do for SVP. Not just for yourself, but it's what the name says, space vermin, which is really what rats and bari are. Getting rid of only a small portion helps everyone in the long run."

00:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly no mission is too small."

00:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

00:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Feh!"

00:27 Lily says to you, "Which guy is that?"

12:43 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

14:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, sorry, I do not understand your question."

14:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Now, just lost 300 more. That silly things seem to do almost nothing fighting..."

14:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "As many as you want, for drones. To help you mine the site out, transport the ore, and defend the site."

14:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:17 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

14:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Sounds great, will check that out, but not on this one. Almost done."

14:17 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

14:17 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:17 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:17 You scramble to your feet.

14:17 The postal machine informs you that you have mail waiting.  After some movements coming from the back room, the conveyor belt coming from the wall swiftly brings forth a mail bin. You grab it off the belt, eager to see its contents.

14:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Each transmition tower controls 1 drone, each relay controls 2. This is a case of build as many as you can, and nicely far away from the coordinator so they are not in the way."

14:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, was also just about to ask."

14:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Was just reading the logs from the QE."

14:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What about them is pushy?"

14:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "They were told that Katina plans to be examined. They demanded that she be examined, like, three times? In different ways.."

14:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "End of the 20,000,000 loan!"

17:18 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

17:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

17:18 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

17:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:18 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

17:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:19 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:19 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

17:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:19 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:19 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

17:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:19 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:19 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

17:19 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

17:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Think, Constantines."

17:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok."

17:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We can use mine."

17:20 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:20 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

17:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

17:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:20 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:20 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
