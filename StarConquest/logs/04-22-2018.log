[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system while cycling its air.

And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go east and south.

And the bugs. Always the bugs.

00:49 "Thank you for taking me along.'" Casen Thale grins at you.

00:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We have to keep clearing out the vents every few days or so."

00:49 Casen says to Damien, "And thank you for helping us! It was looking as though we may not make it out here, for a moment."

00:49 The aerial fortress suddenly fires its ascent thrusters, rocketing toward open space.

00:49 Say to whom?

00:49 You say to Damien, "Yeah, thanks."

00:49 Damien Alexander smiles at Casen Thale. "Sure thing. I love doing these."

00:49 Lily Kaise emerges from the lift.

00:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:50 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:50 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Sun Fish! Welcome to home space!"

00:50 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

00:50 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

00:50 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:50 Lily says to you, "What's up?"

00:51 You say to Lily, "Merry band in the sector back at Frontier cluster."

00:51 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

00:51 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:51 You laugh.

00:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:51 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:51 Lily Kaise asks, "Is your flare here?"

00:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sun Fish. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:51 You say, "No."

00:51 Damien Alexander asks, "You want help clearing 'em out?"

00:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:51 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:51 Lily Kaise says, "We can prob just pop in and scare them away."

00:51 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

00:51 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:51 You say, "There weren't that many."

00:51 You say, "But sure."

00:51 Damien Alexander nods.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

00:54 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:54 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

00:54 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:54 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:54 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:55 There are no other ships in the sector.

00:55 The ship is already moving.

00:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:01 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

01:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a
02:01  dingling bell, a small dusky pink trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

20:14 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

20:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Rest well Lily."

21:14 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

21:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and a small dusky pink trash bin here.

You can go south and out.

21:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.

The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and a small dusky pink trash bin here.
21:21 
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

21:21 You scramble to your feet.

21:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container and a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

21:21 You exit the ship.

21:21 [The Torus; Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You can go up.
Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

21:21 Board what?

21:21 [The Torus; Garage]

21:21 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You see Kiska the humanoid service robot here.
You can go up.

21:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

21:21 You see a large secure xenology storage container and a row of flightlockers here.

21:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

21:21 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, and a small dusky pink trash bin here.
You can go south and out.
Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

21:21  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

21:21 You are carrying a "Zro Des Cartes" key in your right hand.

22:49 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Thick bundles of wiring stream in from several locations on the walls, carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A few cables rest on the ground, haphazardly placed as if the focus was on utility over sparsity. There is only a small, reinforced viewport visible on the airlock hatch, allowing you to view outside the ship. The room's focus is the main display board: essential functions like shipwide power control and alert status are controlled here. A few secondary boards have been haphazardly placed near the primary display, but they seem to possess only the barest functionality. The room is surprisingly spacious, though the random placement of equipment makes it difficult for anyone but the pilot to truly be comfortable here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a dark purple leather captain's chair, a soft dark purple leather couch with a lilac throw pillow and a dusky blue throw pillow on it, an oval charcoal gray area rug, a mahogany coffee table, an interdictor launcher, a dark gray holo projector, Vin the arachnoid security robot, a white plastic box labeled 'Original Space Imager Images', a black storage locker, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Turbo the arachnoid security robot here.

22:55 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:04 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:05 The ship is already moving.

23:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:05 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:05 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:05 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:05 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

23:05 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

23:05 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:05 The computer reports that the bullet "Banger Hearts" has jumped out of the sector.

23:06 The computer reports that the two-person tugboat "Trouble With You" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

23:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:06 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:06 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:06 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:15 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

23:15 Wendy Arroyo nods to a Tardick lizard named Freyja for some reason.

23:15 Wendy Arroyo says, "Freyja's best day too."

23:15 Kani Kahakai asks, "Does Freyja get a tiny, lizard sized shipsuit?"

23:15 Wendy Arroyo exclaims, "She had better!"

23:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Only if the spiders do."
