-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

17:36:57     * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rat
17:36:57 tan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a robotic chef named Nellie here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

You ask, "Ok, any specific place they're running to and from?"

17:40:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well not exactly. I've seen them in various sectors going out to EAOS sectors and such."

17:40:55 You say, "Ok."

17:40:58 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:40:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:41:06 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:41:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

17:41:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:41:18 The ship is already moving.

17:41:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:41:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:41:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:41:27 You say, "I am."

17:41:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A bright river of light dominates the view of space here: a tendril of dust lightyears long, illuminated from within by a handful of newborn stars.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

18:14:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:14:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:14:45 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

18:14:47 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

18:20:48 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

18:20:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

18:22:50 Lily says to you, "I deleted Evenia's keys to my ships. When you get around to it, you might want to delete the one to Starlight Express. She took the lIBS parts out of the warehouse that were needed to build the next Watchtower, the Recharging Station and the Transmitter in 777. So if we replace them which may do so until the beacons fail, then we'll have to buy the repair module and the charger and things. That is so petty of LIBS."

18:23:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I thought she wouldn't cave-in to Ather's."

18:24:06 You say, "Ugh, ok. I will."

18:28:53 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Beacons?"

18:31:40 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.

18:32:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Telex Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:33:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

18:33:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."
