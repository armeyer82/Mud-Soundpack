-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

02:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

02:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi babe."

02:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Love."

02:55 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a
02:55  dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small dusky pink trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

03:11 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.

03:12 Lily Kaise says, "I have some silver felo and there's silver feathered but I missed them when they were kittens so hope I find one when it's a kitten."

03:18 Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo kitten enthusiastically gobbles up a small Bari-shaped tidbit.

03:18 Lily Kaise says, "Kani is fringe though so not sure why she didn't inlist some of her alliance but I think she is one of those who is ehavily influenced by League's bullshitters."

03:19 Shine the big white glowing felo seems to be hungry.

03:19 Shine the big white glowing felo enthusiastically gobbles up a small Bari-shaped tidbit.

03:21 You say, "Oh I'm sure she is."

03:22 Lily Kaise says, "Writing that is."

03:22 You ask, "YEah,.... I have.... So, maybe Fringe and AEU... allies?"

03:22 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah possibly."

03:22 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

03:23 You say, "Well, I don't mind personally. Except the fact that Evenia will probably try to kiss up to both of us."

03:23 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I never thought such would happen and I am not really into their form of government at all but now I'd say League just get chippy with us and guess what suckers you'll lose!"
