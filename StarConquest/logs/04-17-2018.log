00:03 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:03 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

00:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Will try again in a half hour or so as I would prefer more AEU participants."

00:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok. I'll still be available."

00:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I should be available for the run around midnight or so, but if you guys open it up and allow others to join, it will show a level of inclusion. I would try that for now."

00:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I would be happy to help, though I do not think I will be free for another couple hours."

00:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I plan to allow others but would like to allow AEU to have first dibs. Having said that, I will wait until Midnight and we'll form up."

00:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You have two people from the AEU, those are good enough dibs."

00:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Four is generally the recommended number anyways. If you take two AEU and two Fringe, you'll be showing a great level of inclusion."

00:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Heck, you might get league members to volunteer too, who knows?"

01:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Is it possible I might join? I don't have much experience though. So I understand if the answer is no."

01:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "1 sure you can."

01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Just let me know where to meet you, and I will make my way over there. And Please let me know if I will need any special equipment."

01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok will be in about an hour or so so just continue doing what you're doing until then."

01:09 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at Fringe Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Desert Snake". The organization has earned 75,479.78 credits.

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, sorry guys, I was snoozing."

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you haven't done it I can help."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh well! Then we're going to make an attempt to do this at midnight."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "So in 40 minutes or so?"

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes give or take."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Well, I have about 12 industry points. About time to upgrade this cargo hauler? Or do I wait more?"

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Still learning the ropes."

01:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The cargo hauler will be your salvaging ship until you can get a light transport."

01:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I think is around 250 or 300 industry."

01:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I wouldn't put a lot of extra stuff other than from a speciall little mission that... hmm I wonder if AEU Cadets can still do that one so never mind but No, I wouldn't invest a lot in a Cargo Hauler."

01:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "So don't worry about upgrading this grapple or anything?"

01:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I also highly encourage you to go to Space Vermin Patrol and do every possible mission from their as well as talk to the Officer just inside of our Liaison Office Building for some special assignments."

01:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Most upgrades aren't really permanent. Even if you did upgrade the grapple, you could "upgrade" it back to the worst grapple and store your good one at the shop."

01:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then put it on your new ship."

01:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I talked to that guy. I shot up a rats ship, but my weapons got damaged and I lost a lot of the hull's failsafe."

01:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though if I could do it all over again, I would probably just forego salvaging entirely until I qualified for the ultimate salvage sensor."

01:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well damage comes with the project so just repair and go on."

01:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. I will try athat out again."

01:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Am I free to transfer what ever I unload at the station east of phoenix command? Or is that someone else's job?"

01:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, transfer it at your leisure."

01:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You won't actually get points or money until you transfer the station's load."

01:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So when you're done with your salvage you may as well."

01:38 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

01:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Cool. This is the second load I bring. So I will transfer it. Am I at the right one? It says it's fringe."

01:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that should be right, so long as it's east of Steel Phoenix Command."

01:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "It is."

01:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Do fringe have stations like this all over the place, or is this one unique?"

01:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We are working with the Fringe."

01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a temporary station that one of us built."

01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Okay."

01:40 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at Fringe Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Desert Snake". The organization has earned 194,127.59 credits.

01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "So, in consideration of them, we are using their core for the salvage processor."

01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We used parts from fringe orgs so that fringe orgs as well as our own will get the money."

01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Since ringe credits are technically worth more than AEU ones."

01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We will alternate between AEU and Fringe on both of the Salvage and Battle Scanning stations."

01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So Elijah sometimes you will see AEU there and other times Fringe."

01:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "This will also help their civilian pilots accumulate resources, which will hopefully make their government reconsider discountinuing it for the foreseeable future."

01:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The core for the battle scanner makes no difference in credits. Everyone gets their alliance's credits regardless."

01:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It only makes a difference for the salvage processor and the asteroid scanner, really."

01:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Oh-kay? I ordered a station transfer, and an unmanned pickup vehicle seems to have docked and undocked, but I have not gotten payed, to my knowledge."

01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It takes a bit of time."

01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just go about your business. You'll be notified when it transfers and you get paid."

01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Lovely. Alright."

01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, you don't have to stay there. You don't even have to be awake or active or anything."

01:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Brilliant. I now have 15 industry points!"

01:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "All the woos."

01:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Heading back for that midnight appointment."

01:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok are you available now Ather?"

01:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm working on a crafting project."

01:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok then let us know when you're available."

01:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Go without me, it's a couple hours project; it's a stun cannon."

02:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm somebody left their shipsuit over here on the Lounge bar. I hope they didn't go skinny-dipping under the bridge!"

02:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

02:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Soundslike Ather wants us to go without him."

02:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:03 The starship is already undergoing launch procedures.

02:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:03 The ship is already moving.

02:04 The ship is already moving.

02:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:04 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

02:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:04 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:04 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

02:04 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:04 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

02:04 You turn on the silent running feature.

02:04 You turn off the silent running feature.

02:04 The starship is already moving.

02:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:05 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:05 I don't understand that.

02:05 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:06 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:11 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Need one for Bari Cleansing. League or Rats or EAOS will do."

02:13 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Last call. Need one for Bari Cleansing. League or Rats or EAOS will do."

02:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That is only for Tesla you don't need that for a Battlesuit did you go down into the basement Elijah?"

02:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I did."

02:17 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Who would be interested in a Morninstar beacon?"

02:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok I think you can get a loan for that."

02:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I have taken out a loan. I have a battle suit now, just outfitting it."

02:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "What weapons should I get? And what modules?"

02:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm partial to 3 or 4 second-firing weapons, that way you can shoot between minor repairs."

02:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Laser module and minidrones module."

02:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ouch. My credit assistant is hurting now."

02:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Should I get armor module as well? Or can that wait?"

02:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup that happens when you're just getting started. That is why I say do all of the missions you can get from the Liaison Officer and from space Vermin Patrol. Those pay fairly well."

02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You don't want armor on that suit typically."

02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Then I think I am ready."

02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No no armor."

02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll make the money back. You can do 8 low priority deployments per conquest, those pay a bit."

02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And then yeah, you can do a space vermin patrol mission every day."

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Done. So Just leave it here? And they will put it on the area fortress for us? Or do I have to ask them to store it somewhere?"

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep."

02:38 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

03:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok guys Old Frontier Cleansing is off until later today or tomorrow. Appreciate your patience but it's beginning to be a bit late for me."

03:13 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Nest?"

03:13 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes."

03:13 [Tactical Communication] Saralynn Timothy transmits, "We can."

03:13 [Tactical Communication] Saralynn Timothy transmits, "Steven and I."

03:14 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "What tiers, you both have?"

03:14 [Tactical Communication] Steven Timothy transmits, "1.5, sadly."

03:15 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I have a rusty AEU 3 I can pull out."

03:15 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "What are they, the suits."

03:15 [Tactical Communication] Saralynn Timothy transmits, "We both have fringe 1.5 and rental 1's."

03:16 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I am afraid it will not work, because the lowest I have is tier three."

03:17 [Tactical Communication] Steven Timothy transmits, "No worries, then."

03:19 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok, so we are doing this."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

In an attempt to fix minor inconsistencies, several help files have been changed.  HELP LEAGUE POLITICS, HELP AEU POLITICS, and HELP FRINGE POLITICS have all been edited slightly, with HELP LEAGUE PARTIES, HELP AEU PARTIES, and HELP FRINGE PARTIES adding back a list of the various political entities in those alliances.  HELP ALLIANCE GOVERNMENTS has been removed, and in its place are HELP LEAGUE GOVERNMENT, HELP AEU GOVERNMENT, HELP FRINGE GOVERNMENT, HELP EAOS GOVERNMENT, and HELP MUTUALITY GOVERNMENT.  If anything still remains inconsistent, appears missing, or does not make sense relating to alliance governments, political parties, or the various forms of parliament, please let us know.

03:23 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

09:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jeaton Fucain transmits, "Ah, and what sort of... activities did you partake in to afford them?"

09:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Well, when I spoke with the liason officer he gave me a few rather simple tasks to complete in exchange for enough credits to pay off my first ship, and not much else. Once that is through you have a few other options."

09:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "You may have already received a letter from the Space Vermin Patrol Command - if not, then you'll be receiving one in the next day or so. They have a beacon you may jump to, and the commander of the station there has a number of missions you can fulfill on their behalf. Outside of that, you can salvage debris and sell it at planets or stations in exchange for credits, or jump to the Glittering Belt and oversee a mining site if you have a little more time on your hands."

10:45 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

16:04 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:04 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Two sectors east of spinword."

20:26 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:26 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Wants some help?"

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I'm just not fast enough. By the time I aim, the ship has moved."

20:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:27 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It happens."

20:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Just takes practice."

20:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Spinward Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Spinward Cluster."

20:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:27 Streams of stellar gases and glittering clusters of debris unfurl in every direction in nearby space.

20:27 Via general sector communication, Beacon A-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Spinward Cluster."

20:27 I don't understand that.

20:27 There are no other ships in the sector.

20:28 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

20:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:28 The starship transitions into another sector.

20:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Anyway, I'm heading back to a repair bay or something because this ship is now as useless as a hunk of steel."

20:28 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as another starship is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

20:30 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Chaos Pool" has jumped out of the sector.

20:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:31 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

20:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:24 The connection goes silent with a soft click.

21:24 You place a metallic gold touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

21:24 You say, "I'm here and waiting."

21:25  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

21:25 You are carrying nothing.

21:25 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

21:25 The one-person runabout "Wax Wings" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

21:25 The reactionless drive of the one-person runabout "Wax Wings" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

21:25 Katina Faye exits from the one-person runabout "Wax Wings".

You can go south and out.
Katina Faye followed you.

21:25 You sit down on an overstuffed black sofa.

21:26 Katina Faye asks, "What in the stars is that?"

21:26 Katina Faye points at a small square box labeled "From Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa's Crafting Services".

21:26 Katina Faye closes a small matching beaded purse.

21:26 "What's up?" You smile at Katina Faye.

21:26 Katina Faye says, "The injection thing."

21:26 Katina Faye sits down on an overstuffed black sofa.

21:26 Katina Faye points at a decoy beacon launcher.

21:26 You ask, "The what thing?"

21:26 Katina Faye points at a viral injection pylon launcher.

21:26 You say, "Oh."

21:27 You say, "It's just for war times in case of an invasion."

21:27 Katina says to you, "I'm here because I'm weighed don."

21:27 Katina Faye says, "Down."

21:27 You say, "Awww."

21:27 Katina Faye says, "And maybe because I'm nervous, scared, torn, and it's upsetting."

21:28 Katina Faye says, "Stressed."

21:28 You ask, "What's going on?"

21:28 You nod to Katina Faye.

21:28 Katina says to you, "We had an educational meeting a few days ago in the League. Educating the cadets and newer pilots of our consensis, to not work with you AEU pilots."

21:29 You frown. "Sad, but not surprising."

21:29 Katina says to you, "I am one of those that don't agree with the consensis."

21:29 You nod to Katina Faye. "I figured as much."

21:30 Katina says to you, "However if I break consensis, and step outof line and work with you AEU pilots, I will be threatened. The consiquences are unknown right now, but I could get rogued, or blacklisted, who knows what else."

21:30 You frown.

21:30 Katina Faye says, "I said if the consensis is that strict, then why not make it our government's law."

21:30 Katina Faye says, "They couldn't answer me."

21:30 You nod.

21:32 You say, "Well, when I go on this first contact expedition, I could get rogued or something too."

21:33 Katina Faye says, "They said if I go on work activities with you pilots, or allow you on my work activities, I will be contributing to your government which I do not support. But they refuse to acknowledge that I'm not wanting to work with you AEU pilots to benifit your government I just don't agree with singling you people out."

21:33 You nod.

21:33 You sigh.

21:33 You say, "It's a sad situation."

21:33 Katina gives you an almost pleading look and she fights back tears.

21:34 Shule nods understandingly.

21:34 Katina Faye says, "I don't know what to do."

21:35 You sigh.

21:35 Katina Faye says, "Oh."

21:35 You say, "I'm not sure either. Honestly, I don't understand why the League has done this to us."

21:35 Katina swipes at her face to try and stop the tears of frustration.

21:35 Katina Faye says, "Because you support a government that considers unregs less than humans."

21:36 You say, "Well,m that's what they think."

21:36 Katina Faye says, "And have done nothing to try and improve."

21:36 Katina says to you, "Do you agree with your government?"

21:36 You say, "WE're just not willing to give up our careers."

21:37 Katina says to you, "Do you support what their aspects?"

21:37 You say, "No, we don't agree with their views on unregs."

21:37 You say, "And many other things."

21:37 Katina Faye says, "I told them at the meeting that you guys have tried something before."

21:37 Katina Faye says, "And were only ignored by your government."

21:38 Katina Faye says, "I told them that."

21:38 You say, "They should all know that."

21:38 Katina Faye says, "In the end, your duty is to your government."

21:38 Katina Faye says, "Even though you may not agree with what they do."

21:38 Katina Faye says, "They do not think you people did anything to improve your government."

21:38 You say, "We can't change the government even if we disagree with it and most, if not all of us, do."

21:39 You say, "Yeah, because we're not willing to go to prison and give up our careers."

21:39 Katina Faye says, "They think there is more you could do, but they don't or won't say what exactly could you do to try and improve your government."

21:40 You sigh and nod. "Exactly. They can't say."

21:40 You say, "Like I said, we're not willing to give up our careers."

21:41 Katina Faye says, "And I don't want to betray my Alliance, or government. But by breaking consensis, I am betraying my alliance. Because if I work with you AEU pilots, I am contributing to your government who harrass and do lots of cruel things to the unregs."

21:41 Katina Faye says, "They say they have no problem with you AEU pilots."

21:41 Katina Faye says, "Just your government."

21:41 You say, "Many of them probably think we should be willing to give up our careers and what exactly would that accomplish? We've already had people resign in protest and nothing changed."

21:42 You say, "Well, but they're taking it out on us."

21:42 Katina Faye says, "That is my opinion."

21:42 Katina Faye says, "That even though they say they have nothing against you, they're taking it out on you."

21:42 You nod. "It's true."

21:43 You say, "Well, when we come back from this first contact expedition and are rogued or whaqtever, maybe they'll change their mind. I doubt it though."

21:44 Katina Faye asks, "But how can I say that, when they twist it by going back to saying, "Well if you work with them, then you're contributing to their government, so even though we aren't saying we're threatening you, there will be consiquences." which is basically them threatening me isn't it?"

21:44 You say, "It isn't basically. It is threatening you."

21:44 You say, "There is no basically about it."

21:44 Katina Faye nods.

21:45 Katina Faye says, "This hurts me."

21:45 Katina Faye says, "It will hurt."

21:45 You say, "I know it does."

21:45 Katina Faye says, "And it already does."

21:45 Katina nods softly.

21:46 Shule reaches over and places a comforting hand on your shoulder before saying gently, "I'm sorry you've been caught up in all of this."

21:46 Katina Faye says, "I'm not wanting to work with you pilots because of your government, I'm wanting to break consensis because my heart goes out to you pilots."

21:46 Katina Faye says, "Just you pilots."

21:46 Katina Faye says, "Damn your government."

21:46 You nod. "I understand."

21:47 You say, "And I appreciate that."

21:47 Katina Faye says, "However I was told that my heart should go out to the unregs that your government shows cruelty to."

21:47 Katina Faye asks, "So how do I encounter that?"

21:47 You say, "The AEU government and unregs have never seen eye to eye. At least, not for a very long time."

21:47 Katina Faye says, "That isn't the point."

21:48 You say, "I know."

21:48 Katina Faye leans on you.

21:49 You say, "Well, like you and the rest of the League have been saying, it's our government. Not us. The pilots disagree with what the AEu government is doing and how they are treating unregs."

21:49 Katina Faye says, "They can't say that because if they work with you they'd be contributing to your government."

21:50 Katina Faye says, "It would be like, "Oh I hate your government, but I'm going to pay them anyways.""

21:51 You ask, "Well, on the other hand, they really think that taking it out on us pilots is going to make a difference?"

21:51 Katina Faye says, "They also think you guys don't give a shit."

21:52 Katina Faye says, "I have pleaded with wendy to see if we could get a meeting together with some of us and you, to at least get where we stand."

21:52 You say, "Well, that's not true and obviously they haven't been paying attention to what we've been doing."

21:52 Katina Faye says, "Oh no they have."

21:52 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

21:52 Katina Faye says, "They say."

21:53 Katina Faye says, "They say that your performance went up before, after, and durring the strike."

21:53 Katina Faye says, "So that means you haven't lifted a finger to try and make a difference if you really didn't agree with your government does."

21:53 You say, "That was mainly because of cadets."

21:53 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

21:54 You say, "And I know that many of us participated in chasing off merchant ships from using our ports."

21:54 Katina Faye says, "And yes they believe it will make a difference."

21:54 Katina Faye says, "I dunno how."

21:55 Katina Faye asks, "This trip you're going on, who's ship are you on? Pierre, or Melinda's?"

21:56 You say, "The war gallion. I don't know whose ship that is."

21:56 Katina Faye asks, "Who invited you?"

21:56 You say, "Melinda."

21:56 Katina Faye says, "Not sure."

21:56 Katina Faye says, "I'll be on Pierre's."

21:56 You say, "Ah ok."

21:56 Katina Faye says, "Already claimed my quarters."

21:57 You grin.

21:57 You say, "Lily and I haven't yet."

21:57 You say, "Claimed our quarters that is."

21:57 Katina Faye nods.

21:58 Katina Faye says, "I hope you won't think ill of me if I must toe the line."

21:58 You say, "I could never think ill of you."

21:58 Katina Faye says, "I don't want to toe the line I want to break consensis on your behalf. Not your government's behalf."

21:58 You nod to Katina Faye.

21:58 You say, "I understand."

21:58 Katina Faye says, "However I don't want to contribute to yoru government either."

21:58 You nod.

21:59 Katina Faye says, "And in the end, my duty is to my government as well."

21:59 You say, "Of course."

21:59 You say, "Well, if it were me, what I would say is..."

22:00 You say, "If I really didn't want to contribute to another government...."

22:02 You say, "So, if the tables were turned. I would say, I would rather not participate in League activities, but let league pilots participate in our activities and make sure they get paid in AEU credits. So, in the current situation, I think League should let us participate in activities with them and make sure we get paid in league credits and not participate on our ships."

22:03 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "One for combat missions?"

22:03 Katina Faye says, "Yes but taxes exist."

22:03 You say, "Well, it'd minimize it."

22:03 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Me."

22:03 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Chetumal!"

22:04 You say, "There's no prefect solution, but right now, people are just giving the AEU government what it wants."

22:04 You say, "Perfect solution."

22:04 Katina Faye says, "I guess so. Would it be the same amount as if I were buying something from AEU stores? Because they don't seem to think that shopping from AEU stores is harming the consensis."

22:05 Katina smiles wryly at you.

22:05 You nod.

22:05 Katina says to you, "No in my perspective I think things are backfiring on us."

22:05 Katina Faye says, "On the league."

22:06 You say, "I highly doubt your fellow league pilots agree with you."

22:06 Katina Faye says, "Just have the fringe pilots give us the same consensis that is set in between you and Us, and we'll be the ones isolated."

22:06 You say, "Exactly."

22:06 Katina Faye says, "You know what I'm saying? They already dissolved their alliance with us."

22:06 Katina Faye giggles.

22:06 You say, "I do. I definitely do."

22:07 Shule nods understandingly at you.

22:07 Katina says to you, "Repeat what you said again. I'm taking mental notes."

22:07 You ask, "Which part?"

22:07 Katina says to you, "About the whole table overturning thing."

22:07 You say, "Oh."

22:08 You say, "Well, if the tables were turned, I'd say have League pilots participate on our ships and such and ensure they get paid in AEU credits, but agree not to be on any of League's activities."

22:08 Katina Faye asks, "Yes but how would you guys get payed in league credits?"

22:09 You say, "Land on League planets after missions or beacons."

22:09 You say, "Or stations."

22:09 You say, "Then the bounty is paid to us in League credits."

22:10 Katina Faye says, "I think my toe would be hanving slightly past the line if I did that, but it sounds more appealing."

22:10 You say, "Oh, I'm sure, but you'd be minimizing what AEU credits we were paid."

22:10 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Avoid A-59. Mission."

22:11 Katina Faye says, "If I just allow you guys on my missions don't feel bad if my league pilots disperse on me."

22:11 You say, "I won't."

22:11 You say, "I understand."

22:11 Shule reaches over and gently touches your shhoulder reassuringly.

22:11 You say to Katina, "Sorry, trying not to be overly affectionate."

22:11 Katina says to you, "There is something called platonic affection."

22:12 Katina says to you, "I believe it is allowed."

22:12 You grin. "This is ture."

22:12 You say, "True."

22:12 Katina smiles warmly at you.

22:13 You say, "I'm naturally way more affectionate and flirtatious, but I've had to tone things down since I started dating other pilots."

22:13 Katina Faye says, "I am considering doing this, and see if they will threaten me."

22:13 You grin.

22:14 You say, "Well, I really hope they don't."

22:14 You say, "And I'm sorry if they do."

22:14 Katina Faye says, "It is okay."

22:14 Katina Faye says, "I can I say I tried."

22:14 Katina Faye says, "Urr."

22:14 Katina Faye says, "I can say that I have stood up for you guys."

22:14 Katina Faye says, "As pilots."

22:14 You nod to Katina Faye.

22:15 Katina Faye says, "I wish I had a meeting with mister Wellington."

22:15 Katina Faye says, "Just him and I."

22:15 You nod.

22:15 Katina Faye says, "But like that will ever happen."

22:15 Katina Faye rolls her eyes.

22:15 Katina Faye sighs.

22:15 You say, "Yeah, not unless you become the Voice of the League."

22:16 Katina Faye says, "Friendship is friendship. I want to ride the waves as well as calm waters."

22:16 You nod to Katina Faye.

22:16 You say, "That's very honorable."

22:16 Katina Faye says, "I may have to sacrifice some things in the storm, but I pray and hope the friendship stays intact."

22:16 Katina Faye says, "If I get rogued I think all of my points will be negatives."

22:17 You say to Katina, "I'll always consider you a friend unless you do something serious to tick me off."

22:17 Katina Faye says, "Not looking forward to that."

22:17 Katina says to you, "Like what?"

22:17 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

22:18 You say to Katina, "Do something horrible to the ones I care about or love. Like if you were to do something terrible to Lily."

22:18 Katina Faye says, "Uh no."

22:18 You say, "So there you go. Other than that, I will always consider you a friend."

22:19 Katina Faye says, "The voice position sounds so hard."

22:19 You say, "Yeah, it is very tough. I didn't last long."

22:20 Katina Faye asks, "So you and Lily don't agree with your government then?"

22:21 You say, "No, we don't."

22:21 Katina Faye asks, "I might have to ask him again, but what about constantine?"

22:21 Katina Faye says, "I don't think he does."

22:21 You say, "I don't know how he feels now."

22:21 Katina Faye says, "Yeah."

22:21 Katina Faye says, "He didn't before."

22:21 You say, "But I'm pretty sure he disagrees with the government too."

22:22 You nod to Katina Faye.

22:22 Katina Faye says, "Well, I feel less upset than when I walked in here."

22:22 You say, "I'm glad."

22:23 Katina Faye says, "Thanks for calming me down."

22:23 You say, "No problem. I'm glad I could help."

22:23 You hug Katina Faye.

22:23 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Jack."

22:24 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Are you busy?"

22:24 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I don't need you."

22:24 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I want you."

22:24 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Shut up morris."

22:25 You chuckle.

22:25 Katina Faye grins.

22:25 You grin.

22:25 Katina Faye says, "He's a good friend."

22:25 Katina Faye says, "Jack."

22:25 You smile.

22:25 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I do not want him for sex."

22:25 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Or lust."

22:25 You say to Katina, "Just a friend?"

22:25 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "And fuck love."

22:26 Katina Faye says, "Yes."

22:26 Katina Faye says, "If you haven't noticed I'm weary of relationships."

22:26 Katina Faye says, "Although he did try to pursue me romantically until I told him to back off."

22:26 You say, "Oh I know. I'm just teasing you."

22:26 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I aint' in love, so I guess it's dumbest."

22:27 Katina Faye says, "I do miss Lily."

22:27 Katina Faye says, "I'm getting bored f your face."

22:27 Katina Faye grins at you.

22:27 You grin.

22:27 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Oh I'm in love actually."

22:27 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "His name is chocolate."

22:27 You say, "Yeah, you should talk to her somtime too."

22:27 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Wait the chocolate has no gender."

22:27 You laugh at Katina Faye.

22:28 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Unless it is shaped like a gender thing."

22:28 Katina Faye giggles.

22:28 You grin.

22:29 You say to Katina, "Don't worry. I don't want you for sex either."

22:29 You chuckle.

22:29 Katina says to you, "Whuh?"

22:29 Katina Faye laughs at you.

22:29 Katina says to you, "Where did that come from?"

22:29 Katina Faye says, "I never thought of you anyways."

22:29 You say, "Oh I know."

22:29 Katina Faye says, "Urr."

22:29 You laugh.

22:29 Katina Faye says, "I never that that of you."

22:29 You say, "Just kidding with you."

22:29 Katina Faye blushes.

22:30 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "You are going with me."

22:30 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "A-59 clear for travel."

22:30 You say to Katina, "One, I'll never cheat on Lily and two, you're afraid of relationships."

22:30 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Morris I will find needle and thread for your mouth."

22:31 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I will sew it into a pucker. A silent whistle."

22:31 Keying her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, Katina Faye laughs.

22:31 You say, "I'd love to see that."

22:31 Katina Faye grins.

22:31 You grin.

22:31 Katina Faye says, "I think most would."

22:31 You say, "By the way, I don't particularly care for Morris. Just saying."

22:32 Katina Faye says, "He stopped nipping and biting me once I grew teeth and bit him back."

22:32 You laugh.

22:32 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "So jack."

22:32 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Jack are you there?"

22:32 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Jack."

22:33 You say, "He's busy... yeah, busy."

22:33 Katina Faye says, "This is not normal of me."

22:34 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Oh yeah."

22:34 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Right."

22:34 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Meet you at the lounge, Mister Jack."

22:34 You say to Katina, "But yeah, chat with Lily sometime. Despite what people say about her, she's a very sweet woman."

22:34 Katina Faye says, "I've never thought ill of her."

22:35 Katina Faye says, "I have chatted with her some."

22:35 You smile.

22:35 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Faster faster."

22:35 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I'm fashionably late."

22:35 You say, "Ok, sounds like I should let you go."

22:35 Katina Faye nods.

22:35 Katina Faye stands up from an overstuffed black sofa.

22:35 You hug Katina Faye. "Take care."

22:35 Katina Faye hugs you.

22:36 Katina says to you, "Take care and thank you."
