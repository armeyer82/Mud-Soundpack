00:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "You're not looking for a supply store."

00:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What is it you are looking for?"

00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Shule? Who is Shule? Oh, he's that strange guy I'm always disagreeing with."

00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And nope, haven't tried to do any Accord missions yet, but I thought withdrawing from Accord wasn't going to be complete for two months."

00:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I'm assuming that part is referring to the personnel and equipment. Pull all our navy back home, ETC."

00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey, eli... what do you think the chances are that'll get some creds for that trip? I'm betting... very little."

00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You might get some for images, but probably not any for the probes. Not sure about spectroscopy."

00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Jonathan darling, are you on new earth?"

00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I've just landed. And... please don't call me darling... I don't know you that well, yet."

00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh.. jonathan.. heh. Sorry, miss heard you there."

00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

00:12 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

00:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Um, ok? My apologies. It is a general label I give to everyone. At any rate, would you mind perhaps showing me this store I seem unable to find if I meet you on the landing pad? And I meant you, johnathan, did I mispronounce your name? I'm sort of... phrassled having to deal with the teen in the store."

00:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I'm not I'm on old earth and I'm in a pretty pissy mood abruptly. I'll be that way in a bit."

00:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Meant. Joh, na, than. Thought it was pronounced jonathan... feh."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nah.. Jonathan and my name get confused when you hear them over the comms some times. That's why i've just tell people to call me Triggs."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Honestly! I knew I was a teen once, but for the love of god, all this one is interested in are my, um, well, ya, anyway."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey, gray.. take it easy. I'll show her what she's looking for."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "It's not her I'm pissed off about."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Does it have to do with the trip?"

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I just received bad news via letter that affirms how much of a shitty situation I'm in."

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well I did'nt accept the mission, but it seems like the Accord officer is still willing to assign them for now, goign to check on the Gemini."

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Yeh, I had applied to attempt citizenship in the league, and was denied. Which means I have to start the process for a visa, and that's gonna take two years. Meanwhile this ship is a shitty one."

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Very shitty one."

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What ship?"

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh... yeah, that does suck."

00:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm sorry to hear that Gray. I feel your pain.. literally."

00:17 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "So many buttons I haven't learned yet."

00:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Not really. I've dealt with this bullshit way to long. Should've fuckin' retired when I had the fuckin' chance."

00:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What bullshit are you dealing with?"

00:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Politics."

00:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not that I want you to retire, but you probably still can. I'm sure you don't need to be a pilot to apply for the visa."

00:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And why do you no longer have the optiont o retire?"

00:19 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

00:20 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

00:21 Shine the big white glowing felo jumps down from Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's lap.

00:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Because I pretty much have to stay with this bullshit, or retire and lose all my personal progress, despite the fact that we do nothin' we're lazy, and ultimately ineffective."

00:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who does nothing?"

00:23 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Just...leave me be I'll be better later. I'm just fuckin' pissed, and probably a bit drunk right now."

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey, Grays. If you want to get a drink later. Let me know, ok?"

00:24 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Is it gonna be water again, or legit booze."

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If you need help, don't be afraid to ask."

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Get morris to hook you up, Jonathan. Sounds like you need some 'water'.."

00:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "NOpe. I'm just gonna go back to doin' my own thing. Fuck this tryin' deal."

00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey stone. By stone."

00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Out of interest, what do you people use if you wish to salvage."

00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mighty grapples all the way."

00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Indeed. But which ship."

00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I use a heavy grapple at the moment.."

00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just the biggest one you qualify for."

00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Grade 20.."

00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cargo hauler for cadets, light and medium transports as soon as you qualify."

00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And keep your bay extension up to date."

00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Though... I have a grade 30, fine tooth one available.."

00:29 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.

00:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well,  looks like for now, we still have access to all Accord services and starships."

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Hmm..."

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I hope we still have them available... for years to come..."

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Even, not being apart of the Accord."

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Prepare yourself for katie's ditsie question of the night. Where, do I buy... bay extentions!"

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Er.. outccord."

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Check out Ather's book. The drydock has some good ones, but there are others."

00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's a few places, but most of them are on Drydock I believe."

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I see."

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The first one you can get is on the drydocks."

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "And do you know how much that will enlarge my bay to?"

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I think it says in our upgrade book if we got one current."

00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Percent."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "10 percent."

00:32 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And, it does."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I see."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can also get a plant that will increase it a bit, but those are quite expennsive."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What plant should I use on an artifacting ship?"

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Like 150 million EAOs, usually."

00:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My artifacting style is just to sleep until the computer barks at me."

00:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So max speed may not matter all that much."

00:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Your computer barks at you? Wow! My computer doesn't bark. How can I get it to do that?"

00:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

00:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

00:36 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

00:39 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

00:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Think I'll mail Ather about what I seen... and he can get back to me as soon as he finds it convenient.. or inconvenient..."

00:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that will work."

00:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What did you see?"

00:42 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

00:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "A gray-skinned humanoid, with large eyes, that had black horizontal pupils.. It had fluffy cat-like ears..."

00:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, nice."

00:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And.. it spoke to me. two words."

00:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Chippy's chips?"

00:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie sounding amused, roid dog?

00:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Erto, uberdiosk."

00:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I see."

00:43 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo suddenly jumps onto a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "No one else seen it... and there were three or four others in the room, that weren't sleeping at the time.."

00:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, it was on the ship?"

00:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... while we were in the rift."

00:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, interesting."

00:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It was like, a phantom that Triggs saw in the rift. It vanished. Possibly a glimpse into another reality."

00:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "All with it's triganular face.. with a small patch of black tuff on it's chin."

00:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Perhaps father is right, the ginu are still out there."

00:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Found out recently that there is supposedly an Outsider blockade between here and Jinu space. Honestly that leads me to believe that they are still there and the Outsiders want us kept apart. Otherwise what are they even blocakding. I suppose it could really be anything though."

00:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Maybe I should post about in on the board?"

00:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I.. am not sure."

00:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie transmits a string of curses that end with rats

00:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it makes sense that they would want us kept apart."

00:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And there is one in stasis that people have found, I believe the EAOS are working on it. Not sure if they are trying to get it out, or what."

00:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "The eos have way too much power over all the discoveries."

00:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That was what Morris had a photo of, actually. It's at that um.. one place that I can't pronounce. The place that people call the temple of the floating buddha."

00:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We also saw a gnome, that looked just like the gnome I used to see in my mind, and some weird birds that seemed to be looking for someone. Those are things that everyone saw though, it's interesting that only Triggs saw the Jinu."

00:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Oh for the love of... I destroy the rats, get damaged, and then! then! the peackeeprs show up. thanks a bunch."

01:48 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wal

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wal
01:49 l-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, and an insulated white cooler here.

01:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We also need exploration points if we're putting exploration upgrades onto our ships for the organization just as with Combat and Industry."

01:56 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:57 Shine the big white glowing felo rubs up against Prissy the big violet long-haired felo, and both animals purr softly.

01:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, org ship upgrades go off of the org's points, not the points of whoever is buying the ship?"

01:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I need like five or ten minutes."

01:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "To be able to obtain the genetics lab we needed 2000 Exploration along with other points qualifications."

01:58 Shine the big white glowing felo slides to the floor.
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo slides to the floor.

01:58 You stroke the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo.

01:58 Shine the big white glowing felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

01:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Alas, I fear I have not the experience to help, I would be more of a hinderence. I shall practice though, and may come if you do it again at a later date, lady kaise."

01:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is how Angel got around buying that gemini I think."

01:59 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo rubs up against Shine the big white glowing felo, and both animals purr softly.

01:59 Lily says to you, "So are you going to meet me on The torus?"

01:59 You say, "Well, you can't buy a ship for the org unless you're a trustee."

01:59 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:14 Constantine Stone says, "Pulled that from one of the crash sites."

02:14 Constantine Stone says, "I kept that as a memento."

02:14 Constantine Stone takes a bite of a small Bari-shaped tidbit.

02:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All here?"

02:15 Constantine Stone says into the PA microphone, "Here."

02:15 You speak into the microphone.

02:15 Eli stares at a half of a charred brick with a mournful expression.

02:15 You speak into the microphone.

02:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

02:15 Constantine Stone says, "We broke things that can't be rebuilt."

02:15 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."

02:15 Constantine Stone says, "But we can help build some new things, too."

02:15 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

02:15 Constantine Stone takes a bite of a small Bari-shaped tidbit.

02:15 There is no battlesuit assigned to you present here.

02:15 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Conjurer from storage and sets it in front of you.

02:15 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

02:15 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

02:16 You can't do that right now.

02:16 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

02:16 Eli shakes his head as if trying to clear it of something. Swalling hard he returns the brick to Constantine.

02:16 Eli Grey gives a half of a charred brick to Constantine Stone.

02:16 Constantine Stone puts a half of a charred brick in an olive green canvas AEU gear bag.

02:16 Constantine Stone picks up a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural tangerine juice.

02:16 Constantine Stone takes a bite of a small Bari-shaped tidbit.

02:16 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

02:16 You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

02:16 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

02:16 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:16 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

02:16 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:17 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

02:17 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You can go east.

02:17 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Constantine Stone (AEU Utility Combatant).

02:17 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Eli Grey (EAOS Elementalist).

02:17 You peer east...

02:17 
[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins -- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go south and west.

02:17 Eli Grey says to Constantine Stone, "I wish I hadn't seen that, but i'm glad you showed it to me. Does that make any sense?"

02:17 Constantine Stone nods. "Sorry."

02:17 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (League Paladin).

02:17 Constantine Stone says, "I didn't think about that."

02:18 Constantine Stone says, "I picked up so many like it that I'm a bit numb to it now, I suppose."

02:18 Eli Grey says, "No no, wanting to see, and needing to see are two different things."

02:18 Constantine Stone nods.

02:18 Eli Grey nods to Constantine Stone. "It's fine."

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Everyone ready?"

02:18 Constantine Stone says, "Ready."

02:18 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:18 Eli Grey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Moving east."

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident moves east.

02:18 You move east.

You can go south and west.
You move into the area.

02:18 Eli Grey moves into the area.

02:18 You peer south...

02:18 
[Ventilation Tunnels; T-Junction] (inside a battlesuit)
Here, a straight tunnel branches into two alternatives. One can go that way, or one can go that other way. The possibilities are endless!
You see Bari Mold Alpha here.
You can go north, south, and west.

02:18 Constantine Stone moves into the area.

02:18 You say, "Moldy old mold."

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Ok moving in on that mold!"

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident moves south.

02:18 Constantine Stone moves south.

02:18 You move south.

02:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

02:52 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Is that ok Love?"

02:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:57 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "That's fine."

02:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

05:27 --

05:27 October 9, 2317. Approximately around, 10:09 GST. At 65%, from earthgate, and 
90%, from Torus, on a bearing east and slightly up from Beacon 288. We were on a
course heading towards Beacon 288, after a long voyage exploring some unexplored 
space. At least, by myself and many of the other crew. a sight was seen only by
myself, Johnathon Triggs. Many others were present, and had not seen it at all.
The individuals who were awake and present at the time were Morris Corlew,
Jonathan Grays, Wendy, and Melinda Michaels. When we dicussed it, everyone else
claimed to not have seen anything. I, myself, first thought it was part of the
riftscape, till it spoke. It said, "Erto, uberdiosk." to whatever that may mean,
remains a mystery to me. The being sat crossed-legged on a turf of grass, that
was apart of the current riftscape. The riftscape was that of a grassy island.
It was a grey-skinned humanoid, with two fluffy cat-like ears, on top of a
triangular head. It was otherwise hairless, aside from a small tuff of black fur
on its chin. It had large eyes, with black horizontal puplis. It stared at me,
with no expression for a moment. Then it spoke those words.. I offered it a
greetings. Figuring it might have been real.. not part of the actual riftscape.
I said, "Hello. Greetings." It tilted its head as it faded from view.

on its chin. It had large eyes, with black horizontal puplis. It stared at me,
with no expression for a moment. Then it spoke those words.. I offered it a
greetings. Figuring it might have been real.. not part of the actual riftscape.
I said, "Hello. Greetings." It tilted its head as it faded from view.

05:37 Johnathon Triggs says, "Especially after being in the rift for over a week."

05:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes her virtual reality suit.

05:37 You say, "I bet."

05:38 Lily says to Johnathon, "I would also bet lots of credits that that was at least an image of a Jinu."

05:38 Johnathon says to Lily, "It was."

05:38 Johnathon Triggs says, "Someone pulled out an old photo of a Jinu."

05:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If it was part of the rift scape which it could have been but there are some therories..."

05:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Almost have this done."

05:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Is she guessing, or is that based on something? It's certainly possible, except that you said it looked confused when you spoked to it, right?"

05:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No I kow Erto means hello."

05:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I saw a few words in a notebook that an instructor had when I was in the academy. Ather is obviously the onw who would know best though."

05:49 Johnathon Triggs speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

05:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, it tilted it's head at me. Probably didn't understand what I said."

05:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh to start? Just one."

05:50 Johnathon Triggs nods.

05:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then when I put up the next 5 drones, I add another one."

05:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident applauds wildly!

05:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

05:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] almost whispering, Eli transmits, "Human is probably a good assumption then, though it can't hurt to find out for sure.. this sounds like somethign should be reported to someone. If they've found a way to communicate through the rift..."

05:52 Lily says to Johnathon, "Yes probably the Scientist over in the EAOs."

05:52 You nod.

05:52 You say, "I agree."

05:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "EAOS and I'd have to lookup his name as my brain is in a fog right now."

05:52 Johnathon Triggs speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

05:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was going to post my log entry. But.. I'm still a cadet. And it is restricted to full pilots."

05:52 Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I would think he might be interested. I'm not sure."

05:53 Johnathon says to Lily, "I'll have to go over and see him."

05:53 Johnathon Triggs says, "Or... at most, mail them."

05:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The people that probably need to know, don't always check our boards. Hold on to that log for sure."

05:53 Johnathon Triggs says, "But, probably be better to visit."

05:54 You nod. "I'd visit."

05:54 Johnathon Triggs nods.

05:54 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Which scientist?"

05:54 Lily says to Johnathon, "His name is Professor Sonorous Griswold."

05:54 Johnathon Triggs asks, "The one in the lab coat, outside the xenology shop?"

05:54 Johnathon Triggs nods.

05:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I've never met him."

05:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That I can recall."

05:55 Johnathon Triggs nods.

05:55 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

05:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You could write to him though."

05:55 Johnathon Triggs says, "Wonder how one contacts him..."

05:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Send a letter."

05:55 Johnathon Triggs nods.

05:55 Johnathon Triggs says, "I'll send him a letter... er.. a copy of that.. log."

05:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "This is going to sound crazy, but.. Have you ever had any experiences with telepathy or anything like that? Even just somethign very minor like picking up on peole's feelings? Something like that could be amplified by the rift perhaps."

05:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey coughs. "Peoples."

05:56 Lily says to Johnathon, "Well I ahve to call it a day. This is really interesting information though and I've seen other messages in the rift too which I didn't mention to others but not in a language which seemed like jinu."

05:56 Johnathon Triggs nods.

05:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

05:57 Johnathon Triggs waves.

05:57 Lily says to Johnathon, "Hope you had a good time and welcome back."

13:29 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

13:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

18:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

18:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

20:21 You see a gunship here.
"William Dove" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "ASS-E7" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is faded and slightly scorched and painted a white color with gunmetal grey trim. Its laser turrets are somewhat scorched and outlined in gunmetal grey. Its landing struts are rusted and slightly uneven and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a small shiny black circular section, a series of delicate antennae encased in a transparisteel dome, and a smooth dome on the forward end.
It has a luxury sightseer, a luxury sightseer, and a luxury sightseer attached to its base block.

22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey."

22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Kinda holed up in my ship today. Just had to fly over to Hyperion to check my mail."

22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Get anything good?"

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah I guess. It was my imaging payment stuff."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, nice."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm collecting some artifacts."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have almost 400 in my can here."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Holy cow, 400?"

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Gonna be a big payday for me."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, not for me."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How in the hell did you get that many? Are those still from before the strike?"

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But for somebody."

22:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "About 100 are from before."

22:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can pick up about 50 a day or more."

22:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "From the bubble?"

22:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

22:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's impressive."

22:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's getting there. I'm not sure how much they're worth for me now."

22:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not 3."

22:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'm hoping more than 1."

22:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well that many you'll get tons of points and credits."

22:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They're taking what we owe out of what we make right? As far as I know we don't have to submit it ourselves. Richards didn't mention it."

22:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that wasn't my understanding."

22:11 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't seen anything so far to make me belive that's been happening."

22:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wasn't sure how we were supposed to pay it, actually."

22:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well it would make the most sense, since we are taxed like 99%, but honestly they never said to me anything like needing to pay it. I still plan to make repperations of my own anyways, but yeah."

22:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was kind of hoping to ask Ms. Richard if she would set up an account with a negative balance for me on atms or something."

22:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unless that would ruin my ability to buy ships."

22:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I offered to pay back the damages and she didn't really seem to care."

22:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "She was like well, as long as you abide by the contract, knock yourself out."

22:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So far I've only spent money."

22:15 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'll get there."

22:17 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

22:22 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

22:25 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

22:26 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

22:27 A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

22:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. you still gotta eat too man. probably what we should do, is have them take a percentage out of our earnings."

22:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Fifty percent, or even sixty. That way you still make some money to buy things you might need or pay bills."

22:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah."

22:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When this is over I want to have a little something in the bank for myself."

22:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For whatever comes next."

22:35 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

22:37 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

22:38 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

22:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Interesting. Part of that translates to "welcome"."

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, is that the erto?"

22:42 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It sure is."

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'll work on the other one."

22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "This is a bit of a silly question, but were the Jinu known to have any sort of telepathic ability? I find it interesting that only Johnothon could see or hear it, though others were presen. Could still be rift weirdness but, still."

22:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. present."

22:45 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

22:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You kno wme.. I get a little too hopeful abou tthings that are likely just insignificant."

22:46 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

22:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The telepathic contact likely resulted from the rift."

22:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We've never had reason to believe that the Jinu had any telepathic powers."

22:50 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

22:51 A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That word is not coming up in the translator."

22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I wonder if he miswrote it."

22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. that's certain intrigueing."

22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I thought it would be human, or friend, or perhaps traveler."

22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe to something."

22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like welcome to a location?"

22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Whatever it is, it's either wrongly written, or not in the translator."

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm.. could be.. the riftscape it occured in was the floating piece of land."

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Constantine's guess could be right."

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Most of their locations don't have human translations."

22:55 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

22:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

22:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Fascinating... I'm no expert by any means, but it didn't seem like a normal rift encounter to me from his description. And likely couldn't have been pulled from his mind or anything since we were the ones that had to tell him it was a Jinu."

23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "He just aid it was a gray skinned humanoid with cat-like ears and what looked like maybe a beard."

23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. a little tuft of fur, it just sorta sounded like a beard to me."

23:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There is no normal in the rift. Your mistake is assuming anything in the first place."

23:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles. "Certainly can't argue with you there."

23:13 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

23:15 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

23:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So, constantine, we're going half and half on the damages, right? Just asking before I try to get somethign setup to take it out of my earnings. I'd honestly like to do more than that because I feel like it was much more my fault than yours, but I know you've got your own weight on your shoulders and wnat to do what you can, so I thought half sounded good."

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah I guess so. I assumed it was 50 for me, but she didn't really say."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if Ather ever got the reports. Ms. Richard said she would send them to him."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I thought you had just said it was fifty billion in damages on total."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it may have been. I guess I don't remember exactly."

23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Honestly, I'm getting all of that from you. She didn't mention anything about paying off the damages directly, just that they needed the money that we bring in through working."

23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But yeah, half of the total is fine."

23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm sure someone can tell us what it is."

23:25 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I hope the supplies I delivered helped at least a little. It was good to hear that the injured would be patched up so quickly because of Garner Care."

23:26 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

23:26 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo gazes at Mischief the large black felo for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"

23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That is good."

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The other pilots have been surprisingly understanding about the whoel thing.. I thought for sure that everyoen would hate us."

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But I've only met one person so far that seems to hate at least me."

23:27 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior pulsates gently.

23:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not to say that folks aren't upset.. they just seem to understand that we did'nt mean the harm that we caused."

23:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are you talking about Tanny."

23:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, well.. I wasn't going to say the name but.. yeah."

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, she's within her rights."

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Certainly."

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still can't believe we're not in prison."

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm happy about it."

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course."

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, people have been surprisingly supportive."

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Us being in prison doesn't help anyone. We can do much more for the people we hurt this way."

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I expected a brutal, lonely push to 50 billion and quiet retirement."

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I don't feel that hated."

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "All things considered."

23:30 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo gazes at Mischief the large black felo for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Obviously the people I was working with at the crash sites would have lopped my head off if they had known who I was."

23:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No.. And honestly, Tanny doesn't even really seem to hate us, she's just angry with us. She did'n tsay that she hated me, she just said we aren't friends when I tried to ask her if she was ok."

23:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know if ti's your thing or not man.. But I've been spending a little time in the sanctuary on the Torus.. It helps a little."

23:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, like in prayer?"

23:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never tried it."

23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I certainly could."

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah.. I mean.. I guess you can call it prayer. More like.. sending my wishes out to the universe and trying to work a little on forgiving myself.. I don't nkow, maybe that's all prayer really is anyways."

23:34 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Mostly just.. being alone with my thougs in the silence."

23:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I feel like I'm not doing it right.. but one of the folks said there's no such thing as doing it right. they said just do what I feel."

23:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think that's probably right."

23:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think what hurts the most is that it was all for nothing."

23:38 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

23:38 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This brick I picked up, I don't even know what building it came from."

23:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "All of that, wiped away, for nothing."

23:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know... I mean, we didn't accomplish what we wanted to, but I'm not sure it was exactly for nothing... I could be wrong but I think we made them realize that they needed to do something besides ignoring folks and causing escalations."

23:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I kinda think that's part of why we got the offer that we did."

23:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've noticed we haven't gotten anymore taungint type headlines, for example."

23:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er. Taunting."

23:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "That could just be wishful thinking, though."

23:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hope you're right."

23:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't help but think they saw it as an easy way to use us to end the strike."

23:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Luckily if that's the case, the joke is on them, since Ather had planned to end it regardless."

23:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Possibly, except they,  except they clearly did'nt care about the strike at all."

23:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, maybe not."

23:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean if I were them."

23:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would do exactly what they did."

23:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And it would have ended in just a few days anyways, when Outccord went through, so why worry about it right at the end."

23:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Say nothing about it to anyone until someone breaks."

23:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe they were worried it wouldn't have ended."

23:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It makes sense, but they could have done what they'd been doing the whoel time too. Used it to villafy us, instead of offering us a way out."

23:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."

23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's even more distasteful to me, that I did this fighting a government that's actually quite nice and charitable."

23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe that's the case."

23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've certainly done worse to the Union than they have."

23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I can't be sure.. But I kinda think that Richards might have had a lot to do with our offer. I kinda think she went to bat for us, so to speak."

23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe so."

23:46 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

23:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Stars help me, but I liked her. She seemed to sincerely want to help."

23:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I kind of did too."

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know."

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I don't trust my instincts anymore."

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, she coulda just been good at handling people too."

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Surely that's part of the job."

23:50 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

23:51 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

23:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure it is."

23:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It was nice to hear though that she was against Outccord too, and that she was someone that Garner picked. Even if she didn't come right out and say she was against it."

23:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

23:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's mostly the young people. Folks who are more recently eligible to vote, for example."

23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who are against it?"

23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Folks that like.. don't really know any better, haven't seen the things we've seen."

23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No the people who are for it are mostly theyounger folks."

23:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

23:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "At least that's my understanding. I was told it was people of a certain age."

23:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It was certainly teenagers who were out there throwing rocks at us that one night."

23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh really?"

23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, they seemed pretty oung anyways."
