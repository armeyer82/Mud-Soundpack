-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.

22:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:04 You laugh.

22:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "All this logistical shite!"

22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather "Goodness" Jammoa transmits, "Technically, we do need four battlesuits."

22:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather "Goodness" Jammoa transmits, "So sell the league ones in those slots?"

22:06 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:11 [Tactical Communication] Ather "Goodness" Jammoa transmits, "If you can bring your league, that would be wonderful. Alko, if Lily or Shule want to try one afterward, we'd be glad to have you along for that one."

22:11 A hefty white soldier felo seems to be hungry.

22:11 A hefty white soldier felo approaches a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

22:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:11 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

22:11 A voice says over the speaker, "The Steel Phoenix rises. Cleared to land."

22:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:11 [Tactical Communication] Ather "Goodness" Jammoa transmits, "Damien, just say when you're done with your nest if you would!"

22:11 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Alright. Shouldn't be too long."

22:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:12 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

22:12 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:12 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Hello there. We could use the help of a pilot like you. Tell me, do you have an operational aerial fortress, or know somebody who does?"

22:12 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Whatever the adventure is, good luck. I wish I could go but I won't be able to join in."

22:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident responds, "Yes I do."

22:12 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Great. All right, listen. We're looking for some good intelligence on Testudinidae starships. They're one of the Outsiders' Battle Thralls, the ones with the near-indestructible starships."

22:12 [Tactical Communication] Ather "Goodness" Jammoa transmits, "This uh, is a slightly more dangerous venture which does not involve Bari."

22:12 A Steel Phoenix officer is talking to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

22:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident responds, "I'm listening."

22:12 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Steel Phoenix patrols have figured out how they invade local space. They don't depend on Outsider Magistrates or anything like that, thank all that's holy. Instead they use their own battleships and stage out of those. And I mean real battleships. Bigger than most of everything we've ever fielded."

22:13 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you ever need something that isn't tier 5. I'll gladly help out too. As I always have."

22:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident responds, "I see why you need us."

22:13 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Yeah. I'm not going to pretend this will be easy. But here's the plan: We're going to send a patrol to entice one of their battleships near our space. We'll draw it out to a few sectors west. You'll then need to approach it and disable its weapons. Once it's safe, board it and disable it in the usual way that you handle these things. That is, with battlesuits."

22:13 [Tactical Communication] Ather "Goodness" Jammoa transmits, "It's appreciated!"

22:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident responds, "Oh, is that all?"

22:13 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Yes. As I said, not easy. But we'll get everything ready for you. Get a good well-rounded group of four battlesuits ready and head out west. We'll try to have the target lined up for you."

22:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Did you talk with him?"

22:13 You say, "Not yet."

22:13 There's no need for that! Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is a player. Regular talking should work.

22:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

22:13 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Hello there. We could use the help of a pilot like you. Tell me, do you have an operational aerial fortress, or know somebody who does?"

22:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:15 A hefty indigo felo stumbles in from the airlock.

22:15 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

22:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

22:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:15 You say, "Awww, a stumbling felo."

22:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:16 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

You can go north, east, south, west, and up to the starship.

23:43 [Starship "Daisy May"; Docking Bay]

23:43 The two-person combat scout "Bonzai Trout" is parked here.
You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, the aerial fortress and deployment station "Petunia", and a hefty white soldier felo here.
You can go up.

23:43 [Starship "Daisy May"; Main Deck]

You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

23:43 You peer north...

23:43 
[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, Emmylou the humanoid service robot, and a hefty red long-eared felo here.
You can go south and out.

23:43 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

23:43 You hear a sharp clank from the hull somewhere near you.

23:43 You peer south...

23:43 
[Starship "Daisy May"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a temporary wormhole drive, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a hefty red soldier felo, and a hefty white soldier felo here.

23:50 Your starship's tactical computer has located this orifice in the enemy ship's hull to drop you through. Its function isn't quite clear; it may in fact be intended as an access point, or perhaps a weapons tube. One might be wise to assume the latter and hurry onward just in case.

[Testudinidae Starship; Corridor] (inside a battlesuit)
The corridor of the enemy starship is almost entirely dark.
