00:19 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

00:25 Keegan Wantz grins.

00:28 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

00:28 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

00:30 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

00:39 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Awfully quiet, today!"

00:40 Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

01:16 Keegan Wantz says, "I can't lend anyone the set because it's Evenia's, and Ather won't lend anyone the set."

01:16 Keegan Wantz says, "It's a coin game that's similar to rock paper scissors."

01:16 Ryan Thomas asks, "Where do you get a set?"

01:17 Keegan Wantz says, "King beats everything except for assassin, assassin loses to everything except for king."

01:17 Lily Kaise nods.

01:18 Ryan Thomas says, "Ooo."

Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a soft cinnamon brown leather couch, an overstuffed aquamarine sofa, a small purple trash bin, and a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt here.

A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a soft cinnamon brown leather couch, an overstuffed aquamarine sofa, a small purple trash bin, and a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt here.
Alko Delovega is sleeping on the floor. Simon Collins, Tony Cross, and Matteo Hapta are sleeping on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.
Clarina Taylor and Blake Madison are sitting on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch. Ryan Thomas, Gonzales Bourne, and Ather Jammoa are standing here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.
(You are sitting on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.)

03:36 I see no "lily" here.

04:01 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

04:02 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

04:02 Ryan Thomas roams north.

04:02 Ryan Thomas roams in from the north.

04:03 Ryan Thomas asks, "Was that a signal for the rift needing repairs?"

04:03 Ryan Thomas asks, "Or was that part of the riftscape?"

04:03 Blake Madison says, "I...don't know."

04:03 Ryan Thomas says, "Well."

04:04 Blake Madison asks, "Wanna keep listening?"

04:04 Ryan Thomas says, "I don't want the rift to break."

04:04 Ryan Thomas glances at Ather Jammoa.

04:04 Ryan Thomas says, "Any advice, here? I'm a bit out fo my element."

04:05 Ryan Thomas navigates his black touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:05 Ryan says to Blake, "What do you way. THink we should take a look?"

04:06 Ryan Thomas says, "Say, rather."

04:07 Ryan Thomas says, "Hmm."

04:07 Blake Madison says, "I'd say you have seniority here."

04:07 Ryan Thomas says, "I'd rather be safe than sorry."

04:07 Ryan Thomas roams north.

04:07 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:07 Blake Madison says into the PA microphone, "Post it."

04:08 Gonzales Bourne sprints north.

04:08 Blake Madison scrambles to his feet.

04:08 Blake Madison walks north.

04:08 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rift break?"

04:08 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It doesn't seem to need repairs."

04:08 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What's wrong then?"

04:09 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

04:09 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:10 Blake Madison walks in from the north.

04:10 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:10 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Blake Madison sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

04:10 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the north.

04:10 Ryan Thomas roams in from the north.

04:10 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

04:10 Ryan Thomas says to Gonzales Bourne, "Is there a way to check without prematurely dropping from the riftflow next time?"

04:10 Gonzales Bourne gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:10 Gonzales Bourne says, "I don't think so."

04:11 Ryan Thomas nods.

04:11 Ryan Thomas navigates his black touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:11 Gonzales Bourne gestures vaguely. "You try to figure out from the feedback the ship gives you, and it's not always reliable."

04:11 Gonzales Bourne says, "But then I'm not an expert. Ather or Keegan might know better."

04:12 Blake Madison says, "Well, it didn't hurt anything."

04:12 Gonzales Bourne says, "Or Shule. He might know too."

04:12 Gonzales Bourne nods.

04:12 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

04:12 Gonzales Bourne switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

04:20 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're at 45 percent charge."

04:21 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

04:21 Blake Madison says into the PA microphone, "Doubt we'll have to recharge just yet."

04:22 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was just thinking if we can't find a place to salvage and re-fill the hold after we do though."

04:23 Clarina Taylor switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

04:23 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:23 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

04:23 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

04:24 Ather Jammoa strides north.

04:24 Ather Jammoa strides in from the north.

04:24 Ather Jammoa says, "In case you guys didn't know, you can check the drive in engineering before you stop the ship to see if it needs repairs."

04:25 Blake Madison says, "Oh."

04:25 Clarina Taylor scrambles to her feet.

04:25 Clarina Taylor wanders north.

04:25 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

04:26 Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.

04:26 Clarina Taylor sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

04:26 Blake Madison glances at Clarina Taylor.

04:27 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the north.

04:27 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I feel weird walking through a grassland on a ship."

04:27 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

04:27 Clarina Taylor says, "There is only the grassland. There is no ship."

04:28 Blake Madison asks, "Why's that?"

04:28 Hawthorn Dunn says, "All is grassland."

04:28 Clarina Taylor says, "Grassland is all."

04:28 Gonzales Bourne asks, "What ship?"

04:28 Gonzales Bourne glances around at his surroundings.

04:28 Gonzales Bourne says, "Don't make me paranoid."

04:28 Blake Madison grins.

04:30 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

04:31 Hawthorn Dunn says, "It's kind of weird to know you're moving but feel like you're not while thinking you're in a completely weird place."

04:31 Clarina Taylor laughs.

04:32 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

04:32 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Feel that breeze on your face. Or, is it really a breeze?"

04:32 Clarina Taylor says, "Se the lavender sky."

04:32 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Or maybe it's air from the ducts and we think it's a breeze that is not a breeze that is making the whole illusion reflect our thoughts."

04:33 Clarina Taylor says, "I think that's seriously my favorite part."

04:34 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

04:36 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

04:37 I see no "lily" here.

04:37 [Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; "Happy"]]

04:37 Tall yellowed grass surrounds you, dotted by sweetly scented, strange wild flowers. The warm, alien plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, and the planet's sun is beginning to set on the horizon. Two moons loom in the lavender sky. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

04:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:55 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

05:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:11 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

05:11 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

05:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:27 I don't see that here.

05:35 You ask, "None of the cute guys have tried to hit on you?"

05:35 You chuckle.

05:35 Lily Kaise says, "Except that Dunn guy but I think it's his lack of experience and of course he's being brainwashed by the League."

05:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:37 You say, "I'd hope not. At leastnot without talking it over with me."

05:37 You grin at Lily Kaise.

05:37 Lily Kaise says, "Well I have no intentions of doing so."

05:38 Lily Kaise says, "It's bad enough that a couple of them are League but wow, I guess they were so ugly when they were born, that their parents didn't know what to do with them."

05:40 You say, "Well, and even if there were cute guys, I'm sure you wouldn't touch. At least not without talking to me about it. I trust you."

05:41 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

05:42 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

05:50 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

06:02 Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.

06:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:05 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

06:13 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

07:14 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

07:15 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

07:34 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

07:34 Strange hulks of alien origin litter this region of space, from unrecognizable slag that was never any human design and oddly shaped metal plating to glittering metal devices whose purposes are unknown.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:35 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

07:45 The starship has left a unique area of space.

07:45 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

07:45 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep."

07:45 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Mind keeping an eye on things for about an hour and a half or so?"

07:46 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure."

08:07 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

08:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:17 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

08:43 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Didn't know that."

08:46 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

08:47 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

08:48 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

08:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

08:57 The starship lurches as it falls through one part of the webbing into another.

08:57 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

09:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:27 A gust of wind blows through the ship, blowing strands of sticky silk like streamers.

09:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

09:37 A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to a viewport.

09:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:48 A single tendril of silk wafts over you, glistening with beads of moisture.

09:49 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

09:49 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

09:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

10:01 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

10:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

10:19 An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left leg is soaked in blood.

10:20 An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and advance into the fray.

10:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

10:30 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

10:40 Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.

10:49 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

10:51 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

10:51 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

11:12 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

11:23 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

11:32 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is about!"

11:33 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

11:34 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

11:44 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

11:52 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

11:52 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

11:54 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

12:14 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

12:24 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

12:33 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

12:44 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

12:52 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone awake?"

12:52 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yah!"

12:52 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Will you be up for awhile? No one seems to be alive at the moment."

12:52 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And I need some sleep, whew."

12:53 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm kind of half in half out. May want to stop the ship if you're concerned. I'll be up more fully in about 3 hours or so."

12:53 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

12:53 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If noone's awake I can watch it."

12:54 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That works, Simon."

12:54 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I can rouse myself if we run into any problems."

12:55 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

12:55 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

13:14 Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.

13:25 A small vehicle pulls alongside, kicking up dust, before speeding ahead.

13:35 A truck on a converging path swings onto the main road just ahead of the ship.

13:37 Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.

13:47 The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep inside the starship.

13:47 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

13:47 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It broke."

13:47 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Right. Anyone awake for this?"

13:50 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep."

13:56 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:57 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We have about 30 hours of charge left. Does that mean we godda start shoveling?"

13:57 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

13:57 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No."

13:57 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

13:57 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

13:57 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

13:57 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I want to find a pre-stellar or similar object before we use the burner."

13:58 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The idea being that we'll refuel, then restock the hold while we're there."

13:58 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I have the con for the time being then."

13:58 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "With stuff that burns well."

13:58 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alrighty!"

14:01 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, an oort would also be alright if we can find comets. Think water's okay for fusion, too."

14:05 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

14:25 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

14:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

14:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

14:35 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

14:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:46 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

14:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:56 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

14:58 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

15:02 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

15:02 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

15:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

15:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

15:18 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Note: if we are in a true jam before we get to our next recharging system, the debris in the hold should be sufficient to give us a minimum of a halfway recharge if not a full one, depending on conditions."

15:18 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

15:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:32 The curtains of silken webbing billow outwards as if blown in a wind that can't be felt.

15:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:42 An insectile chittering echoes from the distance.

15:43 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

15:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:53 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

16:01 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hello.use phone."

16:01 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hello. And I don't want to."

16:04 A gust of wind blows through the ship, blowing strands of sticky silk like streamers.

16:04 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

16:04 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

16:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

16:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:29 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]

16:29 This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that checker the world below. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

16:31 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

16:31 A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startlingly like a single unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

22:28 The hovertrailer carrying you fishtails briefly.

When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
