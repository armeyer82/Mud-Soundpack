-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider c
15:10 how, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, a sheet of white paper, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

15:10 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

15:10 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

15:10 You exit the ship.

15:10 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

15:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

15:10 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

15:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

15:10 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:15 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:15 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So we just did one in the light escort with chains."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Admittedly the light escort has no laser bonus."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And we had no engineer."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would say under those circumstances the chains performed better."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But to your point the other day, Shule, doing a beacon in a single ship is not really the intended role of an AEU combat ship."

20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I would run to run more tests of course but yeah that seemed smoother."

20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The biggest thing was that instead of it taking 2 full gridloads to blow up a fighter, we were able to blow up 2 with one grid load."

20:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah."

20:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'd also want to compare the performance against the best lasers when you get them."

20:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But you'd still have the grid problems."

22:30 [Starship "Vengeance"; Engineering Room]

22:30 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a large leather chair and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and down.

22:30 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:30 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:30 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:30 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

22:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:31 The ship is already moving.

22:31 The ship is already moving.

22:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:31 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:31 You're already sitting.

22:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:31 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:31 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:31 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

22:31 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

22:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:31 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:32 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:32 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:32 You scramble to your feet.

22:32 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:32 You exit the ship.

22:32 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The two-person light transport "Patriot's Burden" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

22:32 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

22:32 You see a friendly cadet orientation officer here.

22:32 You rapidly enter a few numbers into a keypad next to the door.

22:32 You open the door.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

22:32  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

22:32 You are carrying nothing.

22:32 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]

22:32 This office is small but elegant, the recessed lighting shining softly over pale green carpet, silvery white walls, and a modestly sized modern steel desk with an ergonomically designed mesh and leather chair behind it. Arranged in front of the desk are several other chairs, while ferns in white pots occupy the corners of the office, and on the walls are framed images of sleek AEU starships. The door is open.
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

22:32 You face the Space Defense Captain terminal.

22:32 The screen displays the following options:

22:32 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:32 a brushed steel desk

22:32 Constructed of steel with a fine brushed surface, this desk is modestly sized but stylish and sleek.
On top of it you see a slim black photocopier etched with the AEU symbol, a bright red einrophone, a stack of official AEU Space Defense Captain stationery, the 04:00 14/12 AEU space defense report, the 08:00 14/12 AEU space defense report, the 12:00 14/12 AEU space defense report, the 00:00 15/12 AEU space defense report, the 12:00 15/12 AEU space defense report, and the 20:00 15/12 AEU space defense report.

22:33 You remove the 04:00 14/12 AEU space defense report from a brushed steel desk.

22:33 In addition, there appears to be some writing on the 04:00 14/12 AEU space defense report...
