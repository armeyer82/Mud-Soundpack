00:03 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

00:04 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

00:24 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

00:35 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

00:45 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

00:55 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

01:06 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

01:06 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

01:06 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

01:27 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh dear."

01:36 A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

01:44 Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi."

01:46 Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at the center.

01:56 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

02:07 Below, a large city comes into view, with what appears to be a stone castle at the center.

02:08 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

02:08 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

02:31 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hmm?"

02:32 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hmm!"

02:32 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "HMMMMM!"

02:38 A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.

02:39 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Trying to sleep and the rift thinks it's okay to put me in the middle of a war with bombs, ugh."

02:39 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes."

02:39 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It is rude."

02:40 Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Don't remind me with bombers...."

02:48 A soldier pops above the trench and fires a few rounds from his rifle before ducking back as the enemy returns fire.

02:58 An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left leg is soaked in blood.

03:09 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

03:09 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

03:39 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

03:43 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

03:43 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of soft dark pink slippers off of her feet.

03:43 Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

03:45 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:00 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

04:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

04:09 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

04:10 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

04:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

04:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:34 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Hey little lizie isn't it about time for you to go sleepy!"

04:34 Lily Kaise grins.

04:34 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:39 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist.

04:40 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:47 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Indeed."

04:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:50 Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem to make any sense.

04:51 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:51 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:51 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:51 Lily says to you, "Nite Love. Rest well and sweet creams. I love you."

05:00 Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem to make any sense.

05:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:05 You say to Lily, "Night babe."

05:05 Lily says to you, "Nite."

05:06 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:06 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:10 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

05:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

05:17 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo."

05:17 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey."

05:18 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "People have been a bit mum after the incidents this morning, heh."

05:18 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Cake trying to eat Blake, on top of the bearings."

05:18 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh wow."

05:18 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "He said I can have his stuff when he gets eaten."

05:18 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm still semi awake."

05:19 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm meditating."

05:21 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Can do."

05:21 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm awake!"

05:23 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he groans.

05:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

05:27 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just picked up a storm too."

05:29 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Let it be known that Hawthorn can see through the rift better than our sensors."

05:29 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was just checking it a lot!"

05:29 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Things that go out of view, then come back into view will trigger the computer."

05:29 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And the storm is at the edge of our ship's sensor range."

05:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:53 The room grows a bit warmer.

05:53 The room grows a bit warmer.

05:53 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

05:53 A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:53 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hurray."

05:53 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We made it!"

05:54 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo!"

05:55 You hear a solid thunk sound as something is expelled from the storage room.

05:55 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Bye bye, something!"

05:55 You hear a solid thunk sound as something is expelled from the storage room.

05:55 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There, Now come salvage. Ship's empty."

05:56 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:56 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Make sure you guys remember the imaging and spectroscopy and the probe and stuff. None of those were initiated."

05:56 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We'll do the salvage first, I think. So we can jsut stay still."

05:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:57 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ignore the lumpy rocks, target lumpy masses only."

05:57 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Er, superheated masses."

05:57 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Same thing."

05:57 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "They're kinda lumpy I bet!"

06:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:04 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're as full as we're gonna get, I think."

06:04 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Unless there are less than 10000 unit chunks."

06:04 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Of hydrogen."

06:05 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What probe do we launch."

06:06 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I guess the McHugh Aeronautics is the only one."

06:06 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

06:06 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Did you take an image and begin the spectroscopy program, in that order?"

06:07 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes."

06:07 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

06:07 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're learning."

06:10 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Does it actually matter if you spectroscope before you image?"

06:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:15 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All done."

06:15 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

06:15 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:15 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:15 The starship has left a unique area of space.

06:16 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

06:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:45 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

06:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:56 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

06:57 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Going speedy!"

07:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:06 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

07:07 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:07 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

07:11 Something suddenly spooks the horses. They begin charging down the path, their eyes rolling in panic.

07:11 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

07:11 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

07:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:11 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Weeeee!"

07:12 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Holey shit we're cruising."

07:13 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:13 Listen. You need to be careful.

07:19 Remember what I said.

07:19 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:19 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

07:22 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

07:22 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:22 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

07:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

07:26 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

07:26 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:26 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

07:28 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're going uh."

07:28 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Where this storm wants us to go."

07:28 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Which is southwest and down."

07:29 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

07:29 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:29 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

07:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:33 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

07:33 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:34 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

07:40 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

07:40 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:40 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

07:43 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

07:43 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:43 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

07:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:48 With a sudden screech, the train manages to apply its brakes.

07:48 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

07:48 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

07:49 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm going to catch some sleep."

07:49 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Down to 48% on the NDB, means we're about 520 light-years from home."

07:49 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well!"

07:49 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

07:49 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:50 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

07:50 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks. You too, when you get there."

07:50 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Uhh."

07:50 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Expect drive repairs soon, we're getting zapped by the storm."

07:50 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone alive?"

07:52 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

07:52 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

07:52 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

07:53 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:54 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Repair time."

07:57 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "External ones are done. We're in the eng."

07:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

07:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

07:59 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

07:59 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

07:59 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

07:59 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

08:00 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

08:01 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

08:01 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:01 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

08:02 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Resist Rift Drive. We love you."

08:04 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

08:04 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:04 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

08:07 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

08:07 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:07 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

08:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:10 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, damnation."

08:10 The horses cease their panic, and breathe hard as they resume a more normal pace.

08:10 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

08:10 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

08:10 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

08:10 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:11 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

08:13 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:13 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

08:15 Lightning suddenly flashes down amongst the flock, and birds cry in fear and beat their wings with new intensity.

08:15 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

08:15 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

08:16 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:16 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

08:19 The storm moves off into the distance, and the wind dies down.

08:19 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

08:19 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

08:21 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

08:21 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

08:21 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

08:24 You hear voices crying in panic. "Oh no, the brakes!" The train picks up speed rapidly.

08:24 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

08:24 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

08:25 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

08:25 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:27 Everything goes still and quiet for a moment that seems to last forever.

08:27 The room grows a bit warmer.

08:27 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

08:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

08:36 Lily Kaise removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

08:36 Lily Kaise puts a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

08:55 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

08:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:05 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

09:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:16 You hear something fall in the next room.

09:26 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

09:28 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

10:08 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

10:18 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

10:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

10:29 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

10:29 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

10:29 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

10:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

10:59 A strange-looking starship approaches from behind, being lifted and placed by a giant hand one square at a time. It advances a few spaces beyond your ship and stops.

11:10 You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.

11:20 A strange-looking starship approaches from behind, being lifted and placed by a giant hand one square at a time. It advances a few spaces beyond your ship and stops.

11:30 The ship lands on a square marked "Roll Again!" Dice roll, and the ship advances another few squares.

11:31 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

11:31 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

12:01 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

12:12 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

13:32 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

13:33 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

14:02 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

14:13 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

14:23 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

14:33 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

14:38 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wow, this speed is the fastest I've seen on this shipas of yet."

14:40 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You missed us catchin a storm last night."

14:40 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We were zoomin."

14:41 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Actually I could make it much faster but don't want to change headings without approval so."

14:47 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

14:47 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

14:50 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

14:59 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

15:01 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

15:02 Lily Kaise switches a metallic gold touch einrophone off.

15:03 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

15:03 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

15:13 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

15:24 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

15:34 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

15:34 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

16:04 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

16:14 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

16:23 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Meh."

16:24 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

16:24 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

16:25 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

16:26 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

16:29 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

16:29 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

16:29 The starship has arrived on the very limits of a solar system, the first point where the local star's influence on gravity is anything more than negligible. The star itself is merely a distant glinting point, indistinguishable from any of the millions of distant but brighter stars also in view. This is an Oort cloud, a massive sphere of captured comets, asteroids, and similar interstellar flotsam.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

16:29 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

16:39 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

16:39 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

16:39 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

16:40 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

16:40 The starship has left a unique area of space.

16:40 The clouds overhead rapidly change shape in the wind.

16:40 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

16:41 The clouds overhead rapidly change shape in the wind.

16:41 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

16:42 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

16:43 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Even changing from 213, 19 to 213, 29 causes us to slow down significantly, so going to keep the current heading."

16:43 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I hear ya."

16:45 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If flow keeps rotating clockwise we'll literally be crawling."

16:45 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And according to the forecast it will so."

16:45 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Slog time."

16:45 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he snores.

16:55 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Mornin."

17:09 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

17:20 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

17:30 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morning."

17:30 The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.

17:31 Minor Change: A new sanitation-oriented starship upgrade is available.

17:40 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

17:41 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

17:41 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

17:51 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

17:51 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

17:52 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

18:11 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

18:14 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo."

18:14 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo."

18:20 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Keegan, is this message on the q e new?"

18:20 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What's it say?"

18:21 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Uh."

18:21 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Something about felo on chet's pad?"

18:21 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

18:22 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's old."

18:23 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Aww."

18:23 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's from last expedition, Mike Marshall basically left felo everywhere."

18:24 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh good, that's just what we needed."

18:32 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

18:33 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

18:35 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It was awhile ago, fortunately or not?"

18:42 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

18:42 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

18:50 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Blake, has another cake tried to eat you yet?"

19:03 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Blake, come backkkkkkkkkk."

19:12 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

19:14 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

19:24 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

19:34 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

19:37 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ooh, haven't seen this riftscape in a long time."

19:43 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

19:44 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

19:44 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Taht is so gross!"

19:44 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Pooped out!"

19:45 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ugh."

19:45 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I wanna just not experience that again."

19:46 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You could always freeze yourself."

19:46 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Then you will experience nothing."

19:46 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think he'd rather be pooped out."

19:59 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Probably."

20:13 Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship, but it swerves aside at the last moment.

20:24 A truck on a converging path swings onto the main road just ahead of the ship.

20:34 Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship, but it swerves aside at the last moment.

20:44 The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to mist.

20:44 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

21:14 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

21:24 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

21:35 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

21:45 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

21:45 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

22:15 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

22:20 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

22:31 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

22:41 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

22:45 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

22:45 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

22:53 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm awake, sort of!"

22:58 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sort of!"

23:00 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

23:15 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

23:20 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Something really odd about showering on a volcano."

23:25 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

23:36 Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.

23:45 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

23:46 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

23:46 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

23:56 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.
