-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

01:53 You glance at your communicator's screen.

01:53 Notice from Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars: Kim accidentally didn't include SEAS when she purchased several Power Plants which are being incorporated in Temporary Stations. This is why we weren't included onthe latest Xenology station in Orion. If you can wait to turn in Artifacts, please keep checking the Range office to see which stations SEAS is included in to include the Xenology Station and then turn in your Artifacts at that time. If you really need the funds, then by all means, do what is best for you. Things will eventually get back to normal and the others with the exception of Goodwin and Goss are cooperating in good faith to include SEAS when possible. [10:17 11 October 2317 GST]
There is a warrant out for your arrest. [19:43 12 October 2317 GST]
There is one headline.

01:53 [Dure; Mail Room]

01:53 You can go north.

01:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey, Eli?"

01:53 You can't go that way.

01:53 You can't go that way.

01:53 [Dure; Mail Room]

01:53 Clean and metallic, this room speaks of efficiency and haste. People wander in and deliver or pick up mail, as workers take or hand it out. Boxes line the walls, marked with serial numbers that designate the owner.
You can go north.

01:54 [Dure; Spaceport Trading Center]

01:54 You can go west.

01:54 [Dure; Spaceport Trading Center]

01:54 The trading center seems to be one of the busiest places in the spaceport. Which is not surprising, considering the profits that successful trading can bring in. Avoiding the automated computer terminals used by the career traders, you decide to approach a human trade clerk. This, incidentally, will also subject your purchases and sales to less scrutiny.
You can go west.

01:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey,  what's up?"

01:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Mind giving me a ride?"

01:54 A leather briefcase is already open.

01:54 I don't understand that.

01:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sure, where do you need me to grab you from?"

01:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ummm, Dure."

01:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What?"

01:55 You remove a keychain from a simple cardboard box labeled 'Elemmire, Shule'.

01:55 You can't wear anymore items like that.

01:55 You are already wearing a keychain.

01:55 You take off a keychain.

01:55 You hang a keychain from your waist.

01:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sure, I was actually just over there in the visitors area."

01:56 [Dure; Spaceport Landing Pad]

01:56 The one-person cargo hauler "Hypnotic Mesmerize" is landed here.
You can go north, northeast, east, south, and west.

01:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thanks."

01:56  You are wearing a gold spacesuit helmet, a black spacesuit top with a red star on the right shoulder, a pair of black spacesuit gloves with a gold stripe around each cuff, a black spacesuit bottom with a red stripe down the outside of each leg, and a pair of black spacesuit boots with a gold stripe down each side. Underneath this, you are wearing an orange prison-issue jumpsuit and a pair of prison-issue synthcotton briefs. You are also wearing a reactionless spacesuit jet, a spacesuit navaid, and a keychain. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your face, both eyes, and neck are left uncovered.

01:56 You are carrying a simple cardboard box labeled 'Elemmire, Shule' in your right hand.

01:56 You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a landing.

01:56 Some lights on the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" suddenly flash several times.

01:56 The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" touches down smoothly on the ground.

Note: Not all spaceports possess the starship locator function.

01:57 From a loudspeaker on the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul", you hear a voice say, "come on aboard"

01:57 Board what?

01:57 [Starship "Wandering Soul"; Airlock]

01:57 You see a stationary artifact repository drone here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
The airlock's atmosphere is instantly blown out as the exterior airlock door is opened.

01:57 You may not leave the airlock until its environment matches that of the ship.

01:57 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:57 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

01:57 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

01:57 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

01:57 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Thanks≥."

01:57 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

01:57 [Starship "Wandering Soul"; Control Room]

01:57 You see a sapphire blue nylon-netted chair, a cardboard box labeled 'images', a midnight blue wormhole drive tracer, a cardboard box labeled 'SIGNS', Orby the security hoverbot, Ivy the little gray CatBot, and Gadget the humanoid service robot here.
Eli Grey is sitting on a sapphire blue nylon-netted chair.
You can go south and out.

01:57 Eli Grey uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:57 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

01:57 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

01:57 You frown.

01:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Wandering Soul, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:57 Eli Grey asks, "Hey no problem, everything alright?"

01:57 Eli Grey asks, "What happened?"

01:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:58 You ask, "Can you take me toOld Frontier?"

01:58 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, no problem."

01:58 Eli Grey presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:58 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:58 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

01:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:58 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:58 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

01:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:58 You say, "I got booted from a ship while in the nude and asleep."

01:58 Eli Grey says, "We're cutting it close."

01:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:58 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:58 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

01:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:58 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

01:58 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, Wandering Soul! Welcome to home space!"

01:58 You say, "I know."

01:58 Eli Grey presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:58 Eli Grey ducks under the arm of Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident as he checks a nearby control panel.
(7 seconds roundtime.)

01:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

01:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:59 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Wandering Soul. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:59 "But yeah, everything's alright?" Eli Grey frowns. "I mean, if you don't want to tell me what's up that's cool, I get it."

01:59 You say, "Thanks."

01:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:59 Eli Grey nods to you.

01:59 You say, "I got botted form a ship while in the nude and asleep."

01:59 You say, "Booted too."

01:59 Eli Grey says, "Whoops."

02:00 You say, "Yeah."

02:00 You say, "So I woke up in a prison cell."

02:00 Eli Grey asks, "Lily too?"

02:00 Gadget the humanoid service robot clomps south.

02:00 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] 80,000,000.00 credits have been deducted from the starship support fund.

02:00 Gadget the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.

02:00 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident has automatically contributed 14,646,157.47 AEU credits.

02:00 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

02:00 You say, "Well, Lily was the one who forgot."

02:00 You say, "To get dressed."

02:00 Eli Grey says, "Ah."

02:00 Eli Grey nods.

02:01 You exclaim, "And she'd rather not have everyone find out. She's super embarrassed!"

02:01 Eli Grey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up. "You got it."

02:01 You grin.

02:01 You say, "Thanks man."

02:01 You wave.

02:01 Eli Grey waves.

02:01 [Starship "Wandering Soul"; Airlock]

02:01 You see a stationary artifact repository drone here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:01 You exit the ship.

02:01 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike", the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", and the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

02:01 The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" rises smoothly off the ground and accelerates rapidly toward space.

02:02 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

02:02 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:07 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a simple cardboard box labeled 'Elemmire, Shule' here.

02:09 Hello Love, I am in big trouble! I absent-mindedly went out of the ship without any clothes on earlier today. I totally was absorbed in what I needed to do and I forgot to get dressed. I'm so shocked and I absolutely didn't realize i was totally naked until I just received the notification that there's a warrant out for my arrest. i am going to New Earth now to turn myself in but I am afraid to attempt to put you in your Flare so you will have to come get it if I can't get you out of Dove. i'm going to try to at least boot you out onto the landing pad here on Old Frontier as the station will be closed soon. Anyway, you know where i'll be when they take me in. I love you and i am so sorry! I am so very shocked as I totally didn't recognize that I hadn't gotten dressed. I'll love you forever, - Lily

You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:12 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:12 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:12 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:12 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Dure Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:13 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:17 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Dure; Spaceport Landing Pad.

03:12 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

03:37 You prepare to use an expert battle restoration.

03:37 (3 seconds roundtime.)

03:37 You hear a sudden high-pitched whine all over the ship as the engineer effects swift repair of all components.

03:37 An expert battle restoration appears to have thirteen uses left.

03:37 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

03:37 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I need a temp drive."

03:37 Erik Goodwin meanders in from the north.

03:37 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

03:37 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "There is one down."

03:37 Erik Goodwin carefully sets about bolting an improved temporary wormhole drive to a convenient surface.

03:37 Erik Goodwin says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

03:37 Erik Goodwin meanders north.

03:37 There is already a temporary wormhole drive installed.

03:37 [Starship "The Storm Petrel"; Engineering Room]

03:37 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a swiveling black leather gunner's chair, an improved temporary wormhole drive, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.
(You are sitting on a swiveling black leather gunner's chair.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie snickers

19:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Would you say the fighter in this store is worth it? I've not found many, or any space combat missions other than those on svp, and I already have the cargo hauler..."

19:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still use the fighter."

19:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's the only fighter we can buy that has a jump drive, so yeah, I think it's worth it."

19:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You will eventually do beacon drops in them."

19:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The fighter can be upgraded a lot. And become a really good fighter."

19:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Plus it's nice to be able to respond to threats in a one-person ship, if need be."

19:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. what Stone said."

19:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Supposedly we have a new fighter coming when we leave the Accord, and it's pretty nice, but the point requirements are a bit higher."

19:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "True that. Are their other places to get missions for one of my... low... status?"

19:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "SVP and low priorty deployments are your bread and butter. I'll run a nest in a little bit."

19:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Ah that reminds me!"

19:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Once you have 1000 industry you can do accord salvage missions. I forget the requirement for combat, it might be 500."

19:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Many people run beacons, that you can join, too."

19:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I need to go see if I can buy one of those hermes ships."

19:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sadly, cadets are just limited to those three ships in the New Phoenix spaceport shop."

19:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know."

19:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "You can't be serious. I can't get a hermes ship?"

19:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think so, but you can always try. Go to Luna, it won't put you out as much timewise."

19:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie sounding decidedly grumpy: so I'm just suppose to salvage, all day long?

19:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "No, the three cadet ships are what we're limited to, till we get our full licenses."

19:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not even. There's low priorities, tesla, nests, I can take you asteroid hauling."

19:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacons."

19:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a wide universe."

19:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Tesla... yes, I need to research that."

19:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Jade Burkley transmits, "How many points do you need for hauling?"

19:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Anyone can haul whenever, but you need a full license to get the ship."

19:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I forget the license requirements, but they aren't high."

19:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Jade Burkley transmits, "I have 10 now."

19:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Do let me know if and when you run a nest, sir. I would be most interested."

19:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They might be a bit higher than that, but you'll get there."

20:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I think we should claim the spinward cluster."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...am I correct to understand that point caps are 100 in all categories for cadets without an approved concept and 250 for cadets with an approved concept but no approved profile?"

20:18 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "As far as I know, yes."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just double checking. Thanks. Thought I was missin somethin."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Something rather."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "100 is so low."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It used to be 25."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ehh...it was 25 when I was a cadet."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wow."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not really."

20:19 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You guys are spoiled."

20:19 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew laughs.

20:19 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It took me like three weeks to reach 100 in every single catigory, and that was with me doing literally everything I could possibly do."

20:20 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm glad they made the changes. I think it makes things a lot easier on cadets overall. Having only 25 in any category can be tough. 250 once you get your concept approved is beyond reasonable."

20:20 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Do battle suits automatically get refurbished?"

20:21 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If they're destroyed, no."

20:21 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Toll Station from the two-person medium transport "One Debris At A Time". The organization has earned 758,574.79 credits.

20:21 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "They will over time if they're deployed. If they're destroyed or go back into storage, then no."

20:21 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "For me I would think not having the ships is what would make it really boring, but maybe the low points limits motivate people."

20:21 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Or is there something I need to manually do repair it while it's in the shop?"

20:21 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's when you do things with groups though."

20:21 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, check the menu Justin."

20:21 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They repair even if stored."

20:21 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was starting on my concept at 25 points.. just saying. And.. I capped at 100 in... a week or so? That's with RP with everyone else too. 100 is very nice."

20:21 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh do they? That I did not know."

20:21 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "That suit is heavily damaged. It cannot be deployed until it is refurbished."

20:22 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...so do the refurbishment in the menu."

20:22 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Then that means it was destroyed and you'll have to get the referb...what Morris said."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Hey, johnathan?"

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes?"

20:22 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Thanks."

20:22 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you're capped at 100 you're waiting on your concept to be approved. I know hosts have been busy lately, sometimes we as players, who have way too much time on our hands, just have to be patient."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "That stuff I picked up when we did a nest together, it's still in my battlesuit. What should I do with it?"

20:23 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits an irritating burst of static.

20:23 You say to a wormhole drive tracer, "1 Keep it. It's useful for crafting later. Do you have a workbench?"

20:23 [Newbie Help] "Talking about myself too!" Morris Corlew chuckles.

20:23 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I waited 11 days on my first profile. I admit I was losing patience near the end, but yeah, they're people too. And the comments you get back are pretty great."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Keep it. It's useful for crafting. Do you have a workbench yet?"

20:24 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's not that they just look at it and aprove or reject. They give you back lots and lots of feedback."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I don't."

20:24 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "They are. They give amazing feedback. They don't just look at something and reject it, they actually tell you what needs fixed and give you ideas. It takes time...and they have families, jobs, school, and such."

20:25 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "However! If you want to play your char as impatient about it, feel free. Just hopefully you as the player realize what's really going on."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "So. Nests! Did anyone finally decide to run one? Or."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be back i] 16 minutes."

20:27 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Fringe."

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I feel like a nag here, but I overheard someone say we're the allian ecof probably, and I think we should change that into the alliance that does."

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "W>ll, I do a lot of st*ff, personally."

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "&ut I know w_at [ou mean."

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why I should not land and talk."

20:28 [MTTS] something: To whichever host commented on my horrible atempt on a profile and actually turned it into something reasonably coherent, I never did get to say thank you. So if you happen to be around, thank you!

20:32 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Tabloid."

20:32 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's all a conspiracy!"

20:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What is?"

20:33 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Everything."

20:33 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, I know, Morris. I know. But, doesn't mean it's not frustrating to have concepts constantly not-approved. Then, having to wait more time.. to see weather that is approved or not. Then find out that it's not approved, just because you're having trouble getting a concept you want, across, in a single sentance. Which, is the frustrating part... on top of that, you had a well worded, fairly decent profile all nicely prepared.. then loose it, because your computer was being bumb and the program you were using it on, 'deactivates' and can't save it.. and... ugh. -- It's just been one of those days."

20:33 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "So who blew up Grenwold?"

20:33 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Bob Smith."

20:33 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "He's been coordinating this conspiracy."

20:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If they're being denied, pay careful attention to what hosts are telling you. If you follow directions and only change what they ask, you'll be ok."

20:34 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Maybe Grenwold was never real."

20:34 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "No, it was real. They used it to cover up when they blew up earth."

20:35 You blink heavily and then doze off.

20:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ouch."

20:35 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The one we've got now is just a fake. Notice how everyone insists on calling it old? Why would you have to specify!"

20:36 [General Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Suuuuuure! And the alliances are just, ya know, categories for soup."

20:36 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Just in case someone hasn't figured it out yet, ya know, to be safe and all, I've been being very, very sarcastic."

20:36 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's what I've been doing. But, you know what? I've decided to find a mentor person and run it by them first.. So, when I resubmit.. I can be actaully approved. Or, someone that knows what the hosts want and are looking for."

20:37 [General Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "No, really?"

20:37 [Newbie Help] Cadet Kert On'Marr transmits, "Heh, don't use me for your mentor. Haha. Did you try the help profile thing yet? And all the subsections referenced therein?"

20:37 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I know, it's so surprising isn't it?"

20:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Old...tradition, respect...that kinda thing. As opposed to new, fake, fabricated, plasteel...Best's Earth as opposed to Goodest Earth."

20:37 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mentors can be very helpful."

20:37 [General Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "It soooo is."

20:37 [Newbie Help] Katie Celayla transmits, "So why do I see cadet in front of a few peoples name, and not my own? Is that a profile approval thingy?"

20:38 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Heh, yeah Kert."

20:38 [Newbie Help] Cadet Kert On'Marr transmits, "My title. Type title."

20:38 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "No, it's something you can set with the title command."

20:38 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I see."

20:38 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Thank ya."

20:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Looky all the cadets! Just remember...cadets are people too! What ever happened to the SPCC?"

20:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sorry, Katie... was a little distracted. Glad you're question was answered."

20:39 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You get one that reflects your current status, a few for certain things that are hard coaded, but all the interesting ones come from roleplaying."

20:39 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh man."

20:39 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Gotcha."

20:40 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I passed it on, it's not my fault it died!"

20:40 [General Communication] "Right bout the time ya stopped bein a cadet, right?" Morris Corlew laughs. "Ain't that just a touch hypocritical?"

20:40 [General Communication] Pilot Erik Goodwin transmits, "Cadets arn't people anymore!"

20:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Like I said, hypocritical."

20:41 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin chortles.

20:41 [General Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Aw, I got a felo nest, and no goddam felo."

20:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They'll come outta the nest."

20:42 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It takes time."

20:42 [General Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Hmm, somehow I doubt it, this one was salvaged from space."

20:42 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You what?"

20:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What?"

20:42 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Um."

20:42 [General Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Quite."

20:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Can I see it?"

20:42 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'd like to see it too."

20:43 [General Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I was actually getting someone for a cadet officer, and happened to spot it on my rundown of the sector."

20:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wait...that's probably a Rat's nest...and you salvaged it?"

20:43 [General Communication] Katie after a sigh, come to new earth and see it for yourself

20:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "On my way."

20:43 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Coming."

22:43 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

22:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:43 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 068" has launched from Residential Structure.

22:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to The Glittering Belt. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:44 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:44 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

22:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:44 This asteroid belt is unusually close to its star, and the slowly rotating asteroids glitter brightly in the sunlight.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Space Station Delta in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:44 Via general sector communication, Space Station Delta transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

22:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:44 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

22:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:45 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:45 You peer out...

22:45 
[Space Station Delta; Dock]
Though simply constructed and without the usual amenities, this enormous dock provides space for dozens of ships. Starships periodically enter the dock, thrusters burning against the sudden change to artificial gravity. A few of the surfaces are a cold metallic gray, dirty with years of exhaust, though most have been recently replaced and gleam under the bright recessed lighting in the walls. Wide corridors lead into the station to the northwest and northeast. A wide ramp leads down below the station to the asteroid mining facility.
