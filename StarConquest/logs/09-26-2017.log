-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:53:46 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:07:09 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

01:10:42 There is one board post.

01:10:51 You glance at your communicator's screen.

01:20:38 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:20:40 You say, "It is."

01:20:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:21:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

01:32:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I ams o conflicted over this Love."

01:32:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Outccord cannot go forward."

01:33:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sorry but yes these guys will have to work very hard to make restitution and I am not sure I want to bail either of them out."

01:33:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know it's cold."

01:33:51 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:33:54 You say, "Me too."

01:34:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I will contribute to a fund but I won't bail constantine out entirely although I could."

01:34:32 You say, "But I guess the government isn't listening and won't. Outccord will go through in a few days regardless of what any of us do."

01:34:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Becasue I feel as though they're getting off and we're facing some very dire circumstances ahead of us."

01:35:02 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:35:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes it was an accident but it was deliberate."

01:35:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I will reserve my comments to just you I do want to hear what Ather has to say."

01:35:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

01:35:41 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:35:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Even though I am just livid toward him."

01:36:02 You say, "He figures we have no leg to stand on."

01:36:05 You sigh.

01:36:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Oh so Ather already said that?"

01:36:20 You nod. "He did."

01:36:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is one day I sure wish I could have been here but I couldn't."

01:37:00 You say, "I know. I wasn't here much of the day either."

01:38:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So what have all of the nay-sayers been saying?"

01:38:28 You say, "I don't know. I haven't been listening to General."

01:38:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh probably good idea."

01:38:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

01:39:13 You say, "But my guess is they're asking if all of this we went through was worth it and what was the point if Outccord is just going to go through anyways."

01:39:16 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:39:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well tomorrow when our scoop goes down I can put the new one back up right or actually on Thursday morning."

01:39:43 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:39:51 You say, "Guess I can go do beacons now."

01:40:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If we're not on strike and this is one of our few outlets for income and especially for megacredits for the org we have to."

01:40:22 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:40:25 You say, "Definitely."

01:40:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

01:40:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

01:41:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well his is so hard to just turn my back on and go forward without a very guilty conscience."

01:41:23 You say, "Yeah, I know."

01:42:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So yes these guys want to make restitution but far more citizens are going to be harmed in the longrun."

01:43:02 You sigh. "Very true."

01:44:58 [Tactical Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Anybody interested in midnight combat missions?"

01:45:16 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Yes."

01:45:31 [Tactical Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "What sorts?"

01:45:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh a couple of days ago I would have said yes to missions but right now..."

01:45:54 You say, "I know. The most I want to do is beacons in my little flare."

01:45:57 You sigh.

01:46:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

01:46:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I'm not really up to it right now but perhaps tomorrow?"

01:46:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just don't feel much like hitting the ground running to work just yet."

01:47:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But if you really wanted to, I would."

01:47:51 You say, "Sure. We can try to do some tomorrow."

01:47:54 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:50:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I do hope Johann will go forward with the artifacting trip."

01:50:52 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:51:10 You say, "Now it seems there was really no point for us to have stayed here."

01:51:56 [Tactical Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...anybody for midnight missions, please come to the Old Earth lounge so I can see what we got."

01:52:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Constntine, can you let the liaison office know that Ather called off the strike and see if they won't do something about his rogueing? It's really not fair that mine was removed and his wasn't."

01:53:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:53:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course. Good thinking."

01:54:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pats an overstuffed dark green chair lightly.

01:54:38 Lily says to you, "Please sit down Love."

01:54:39 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:54:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:54:50 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:55:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

01:55:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You know Love if you weren't here, I'd probably go turn in my license."

01:55:19 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Same here."

01:55:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "With you I will do what I can to go forward but I just dread what's ahead."

01:56:21 You say, "It sure doesn't look very promising."

01:56:25 I don't understand that.

01:56:27 You frown.

01:56:35 Lily nods sadly.

01:56:36 You say, "The future that is."

01:57:13 You say, "Maybe if they unrogue Ather, he can take SDC."

01:57:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "True and maybe Eli would take Voice over again."

01:57:57 You say, "Well, Eli is no longer rogued."

01:58:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I have to say I doubt they will take eli's rogue status away until he has made restitution."

01:58:17 You say, "He's no longer rogued."

01:58:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I could be very wrong though."

02:07:04 [Tactical Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "An unreg force."

02:07:09 Lily says to you, "Chet is under siege."

02:07:13 I don't understand that.

02:07:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Chet's bar."

02:07:15 You say, "I know."

02:07:19 You say, "Tell them we're on the way."

02:07:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

02:07:21 [Tactical Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "If ya ain't got a ship, I can crew here."

02:07:42 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:07:42 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:07:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:07:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:07:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:07:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

02:07:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:07:57 [Tactical Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "You comin here?"

02:08:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:08:07 "Llips," hmm?  Well, better luck next time.

02:08:11 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:13:43 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "And you always call me off as if I'm not capable. I want to help."

02:14:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "What's he whining about now?"

02:14:05 Via general sector communication, I'll Give You Something To Cry About transmits a text-based transmission: "I have never called you off. But we crewed. If you'd said you were available I woudla brought the cruiser"

02:14:05 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

02:14:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Go fuck yourself."

02:14:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Not you Love."

02:14:35 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

02:14:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "JI would rather do taht!"

02:14:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I'd rather do that!"

02:14:44 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "Well, you just called me off."

02:14:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

02:14:57 Via general sector communication, I'll Give You Something To Cry About transmits a text-based transmission: "once is not always."

02:15:05 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

02:15:10 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's not the first time."

02:15:16 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.

02:15:16 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.
A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are powered down.

02:16:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I think it's good for us to help defend Mutuality if we can manage to and show those bastards."

02:16:13 You say, "You know what? I don't' have the patience to deal with this."

02:16:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:16:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:16:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:16:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

02:16:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:16:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:16:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:16:29 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:16:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:16:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:16:32 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

02:16:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:16:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:16:34 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:16:37 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

02:16:37 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:16:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:16:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:16:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

02:16:51 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 078" has landed on the planet New Earth.

02:17:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's the first time?"

02:17:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:17:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:17:14 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:17:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:17:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:17:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Morri's arrogance and rudeness."

02:17:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:17:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Morris's."

02:17:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:17:36 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:17:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I showed up to help and Morris called me off."

02:17:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Fucking asshule!"

02:17:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

02:18:00 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:18:00 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:18:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:18:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Because he wants all of the credit for everything when it would be to our credit to help defend Mutuality."

02:18:32 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:18:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, yeah it would."

02:18:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:18:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "He knows it too and he certainly doesn't want us to sshow in good faith."

02:19:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I hope to hell that son of a bitch burns in hell!"

02:19:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:20:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have no right to call for this, but I hope if Morris ever calls for a crew that none of you help him anymore."

02:20:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Morris's statements about me lately have led me to believe he wouldn't want to work with me again anyway."

02:20:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I'm sure he's not the only one."

02:20:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And som help me God he better not let me engineer for him."

02:21:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I will make sure his ship gets destroyed."

02:21:21 Shule fumes.

02:21:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No shule stop right now."

02:23:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:23:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I'm glad he is too jealous of my engineering skills to allow me to engineer heh."

02:25:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:26:09 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:26:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think we should have jsut stayed there and been a pain in his butt."

02:26:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But you see, you allowed him to get his way."

02:26:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He has no right to dictate where you go and what you engage."

02:27:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He is actually interfering with our ability to defend humanity when he does that."

02:27:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So as SDC, if I were you, I'd write a letter to Nissi Valdaire relating exactly what he has done."

02:27:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because he is in the wrong."

02:27:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Guys, I don't think my situation is going to help us any with regards to getting our station status back. So I'm sorry about that."

02:28:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

02:28:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:28:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I didn't think it would be reversed anyway."

02:28:39 "I will, but I need to calm down first." You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I'm going to be very disrespectful if I write anything right now."

02:28:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:28:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So I will be putting up a Xenology staiton soon if you want to turn in your argivacts for cash as I know you can use it."

02:28:55 Shule takes a deep breatha and looks away.

02:29:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be welcome."

02:29:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where were you thinking you'd put it?"

02:29:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:29:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok yeah and we'd at least get some command out of it and that helps us."

02:29:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "If I can suggest putting it somewhere out of the way, as a clear signal that only we intend to use it."

02:29:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:29:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Probably not a ton but it would help."

02:29:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think putting them up in Orion or something might make people think we're trying to trick people into using our stations, and make them hate us more."

02:30:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:30:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I think we need to encourage our AEU pilots to but it doesn't matter where we put it because it will show on the Station Reference."

02:30:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:30:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But yes we'd keep it in AEU Space."

02:30:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true, but I think if newer pilots who don't know better were able to accidentally choose ours, for example, that might make people mad."

02:30:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not for the other alliance pilots unless they go to the station first."

02:30:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, sounds good."

02:31:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:31:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well they should and they should support us and not them especially if they're not helping us at all as no org but ather's will benefit now."

02:31:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The league have stations set up that we don't know about."

02:32:41 You're already sitting.

02:32:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:32:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well they may too and they very well can so we have the right to put our staitons out there for anyone to use and if they want to play, then they should add us back to the staitons and this wouldn't happen in the first place. I'm tired of cattering to them."

02:32:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:32:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Catering."

02:32:55 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:33:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:33:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You see this business of pandering and saying we won't do this and that puts us at their advantage to disadvantage us."

02:33:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just a thought. Evenia is a really good friend of mine. If we try to avoid angering everyone for a while, I think we might be able to get back in."

02:33:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'll support whatever you decide, of course."

02:34:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:34:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't think so and Evenia has to apologize to me in front of Johan for what she did to shule while I wasn't around."

02:34:19 [Tactical Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...had a delay 'cause of that, but anybody who wants missions, come to the old earth loung eplease."

02:34:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do you mean? What did she do?"

02:34:49 You sigh.

02:34:52 You say, "Ugh."

02:35:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:35:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You see she did something very forward and she did it deliberately to flaunt herself and come onto Shule when I wasn't around."

02:35:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Really? I have to admit I'm surprised by this. When was this?"

02:36:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:36:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So let's see I'll be blunt. You don't just flaunt your boobs to another person's significant other if you don't have ill intent."

02:36:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Several months back."

02:36:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I see."

02:36:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

02:36:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, all I'm saying is I have a good relationship with her that we might be able to leverage if we ever wanted back in."

02:36:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just think about it."

02:36:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:36:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "She knew I wasn't around and she could get away with it."

02:36:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's all I'm asking."

02:37:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:37:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have and you don't know the half of things constantine."

02:37:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, well I was only suggesting it as a way to help us out. I didn't mean any disrespect to either of you, obviously."

02:38:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:38:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "My biggest issue was with Morris because Melinda specifically told me not to include him on the Asteroid Processor. So what does he do when he formed his org was to start pressuring me."

02:38:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry I brought it up."

02:38:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Mutters' It's fine Constantine. You didn't know."

02:39:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:39:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So I told him politely that this was Melinda's request and that if I could find a spot on the Asteroid Processor, I would accomodate him and I did but he was still not happy."

02:39:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, that's Morris."

02:39:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:39:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:39:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So you see he just wanted to find an excuse to backstab us and so until Nissi Valdaire decides that she isn't going to listen to Morris's every little temper tantrum, we're screwed."

02:40:47 "And I'm sorry." You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I did hear your reaction to Morris's general sector message and yes, you can do that to me any time you'd like."

02:40:53 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:40:56 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:41:51 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:42:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:42:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok Love I don't blame you but next time..."

02:42:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Do not leave and just don't engage him."

02:42:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just let him fume."

02:43:03 You shrug. "He'll still take the credit and not even thank me for the help."

02:43:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Also please, write a letter to Nissi and don't back down do it because he interfered with out offer to assist in the defense of the Mutuality."

02:43:19 You nod. "I definitely will."

02:43:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because let it be known that we will be there to help and we're not just going to let everyone else do the work."

02:43:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:44:03 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:44:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:44:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well Constantine the scoop will go offline sometime Thursday morning but I will put up the next one. First off, we're no longer on strike and our scoop does not interfere with anyone."

02:44:57 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Pirates and Peacekeeprs in Dustry reaches. I didn't get a good look only saw them as I was jumping through."

02:45:01 You laugh. "But I never thought I'd hear you say that you'd rather fuck me yourself."

02:45:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed."

02:45:08 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We'll check it out."

02:45:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

02:45:19 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There was at least a frigate."

02:45:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I had to say it! It just struck me funny! But I sure as hell wouldn't fuck Morris."

02:45:36 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'll check it out as well."

02:45:40 Lily gaggs.

02:45:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Constantine, want to help[ gun?"

02:45:44 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:45:44 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:45:49 You say, "We're going in."

02:45:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure, I can be back in 3 minutes."

02:45:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:45:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wait ther's jsut two of us."

02:46:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:46:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:46:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Meet us at the Torus."

02:46:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Are we getting a different ship?"

02:46:10 You nod.

02:46:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:46:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

02:46:17 Which sector did you mean?

02:46:17 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

02:46:18 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:46:18 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:46:18 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

02:46:22 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:46:23 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:46:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I kind of hoped to gun a little heh but it's ok."

02:46:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:46:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:46:25 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:46:26 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

02:46:26 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk" has jumped out of the sector.

02:46:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:46:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:46:29 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Intel report, 11 merry and, one peacekeeper from accord."

02:46:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:46:30 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:46:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "On my way. Don't mind the smell. I hit the cantina pretty hard last night when I thought I was going to Dure."

02:46:33 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

02:46:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was just going to buy some soap."

02:46:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh there's not much there."

02:46:48 [Tactical Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "11? Jeez."

02:46:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

02:46:54 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:46:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Shoooot."

02:46:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:46:58 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yup. Anyone crewing?"

02:46:59 [Tactical Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. Got ships over here. Anybody crewin."

02:47:00 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:47:07 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Anybody need assistance?"

02:47:09 [Tactical Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. Come on over James."

02:47:13 [Tactical Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes Mel."

02:47:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just landed, which dock are you guys at?"

02:47:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:47:24 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:47:29 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "They haven't yet interdicted. I'm returning to old earth to crew."

02:47:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:47:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "1."

02:47:36 You hold Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's hand, taking her into your group.

02:47:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:47:42 I don't understand that.

02:47:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Alpha."

02:47:45 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:47:46 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:47:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:47:47 You scramble to your feet.

02:47:48 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

02:47:48 You exit the ship.
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
Constantine Stone is standing here.
You can go north and down.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

02:47:49 Constantine Stone waves.

02:47:52 a large expandable telescoping xenology container seems to have no desire to join your group.

02:47:56 You hold Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

02:47:59 You key in a transport of Firestorm to your location.

02:48:00 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident and Constantine Stone followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:48:00 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:48:00 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident and Constantine Stone followed you.

02:48:01 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:48:01 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:48:02 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:48:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

02:48:07 Constantine Stone walks up.

02:48:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:48:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:48:18 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:48:24 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Dusty Reaches. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:48:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:48:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

02:48:27 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

02:48:28 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

02:48:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:48:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:48:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:48:32 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

02:48:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok Shule do not back down if Morris says stuff."

02:48:35 Via general sector communication, Beacon C-09 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Dusty Reaches."

03:00:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:00:39 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Been a while since I gunned."

03:00:40 You lift a small plastic cover and press a green button.

03:00:40 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.
A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are powered down.

03:00:41 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:00:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:00:53 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:00:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Woo we got 1 more combat point for the org haha."

03:00:57 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Been a while since I've flown. Sorry, my flying sucked!"

03:00:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:00:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:01:07 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nah, it was fine."

03:01:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:01:08 You are credited with 929,970.24 EAOS credits of bounty.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

03:01:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Naa you were fine!"

03:01:13 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Did any of the accord ships make it out?"

03:01:13 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:01:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

03:01:21 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:01:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:01:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh Morris was pissed haha."

03:01:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:01:41 You laugh.

03:01:50 Constantine Stone walks in from above.

03:01:53 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:01:55 Constantine Stone says, "Thanks guys."

03:01:56 Constantine Stone waves.

03:01:57 The communications systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

03:01:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think we should be a thorn in his side ever chance we can get."

03:02:02 You grin.

03:02:04 Constantine Stone walks out.

03:02:05 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:02:41 You say, "Sorry, I missed the tactical communications. I heard you say watch your locks, but missed Morris's response."

03:03:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sorry we hurt your pretty little ship."

03:03:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or something like that."

03:03:17 You laugh.

03:03:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I said it's not mine."

03:03:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:03:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think it's funny but I almost said ok then next time it happens we won't consider it accidental."

03:03:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And that's serious."

03:03:56 You say, "He's lucky I didn't hear that."

03:04:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep."

03:04:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:04:21 You say, "I would have told him well last time I hit your ship accidentally, I should have said the same thing to you."

03:04:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But everytime we are available and he has a gunship full and we want to go play, don't hold back and just ignore his crap."

03:04:54 You say, "Actually, I locked on his ship, didn't even hit it."

03:04:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:05:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well probably because Constantine was watchful."

03:05:24 You say, "No, I'm talkng about another time."

03:05:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

03:05:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:05:31 You laugh.

03:05:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

03:05:51 You say, "You know we could out run his little cruiser any day of the week in this."

03:06:27 You hold Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's hand, taking her into your group.

03:36:14 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:36:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh guess I did and hey we might as well go take care of belt management."

03:36:37 You nod. "True."

03:36:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

03:36:41 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:36:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:36:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:36:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:36:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:36:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:37:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to The Glittering Belt. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:37:02 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:37:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:37:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:37:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:37:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:37:09 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."

03:43:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:43:10 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:43:19 You say to Lily, "I'm sorry I got so upset earlier and you had to see that."

03:43:37 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:44:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh that was mild compared to some of our fight."

03:44:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Fights."

03:44:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:44:14 You say, "True."

03:44:15 I don't understand that.

03:44:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'you need to be more defiant though."

03:45:36 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:45:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Please don't hesitate to write to Nissi though she needs to know how nasty he is."

03:46:03 You say, "I will first thing in the morning."

03:46:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

03:46:08 You say, "When I wake up."

03:47:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know it's time off of your clock to deal with but this jerk is getting with far too much and you see he knows he can intimmidate you and seriously that's not how you could stand up to him."

03:47:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:49:26 You say, "Next time he says something like that in response to hitting our ship, please respond that we will not consider it accidental if it happens again."

03:49:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I most definitely will."

03:49:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because that's not the first time."

03:50:02 You say, "I would, but I'm usually flying and don't have the time to say that."

03:54:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "It's fine!"

03:54:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Just fine!"

03:54:23 You laugh.

03:54:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tickles you!

03:54:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I'm not sure I'm upt to it this morning but you're in for it!"

03:54:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident giggles at you.

03:55:01 You say, "We can wait."

03:55:03 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:55:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:55:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident helps herself to a slice of pinwheel pizza.

03:55:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident dangles a day old slice of pinwheel pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, but it seems surprisingly uninterested. Perhaps it's actually full.

03:55:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops."

03:55:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a bite of a day old slice of pinwheel pizza.

03:58:55 You beam at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:00:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

04:02:03 You say to Lily, "I know you don't like it when people use crude language too much."

04:02:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Morris's behavior right on Tactical is clearly in violation of our NAP as well as his attitude was not professional nor in keeping with acceptable inter-alliance conduct. If you fire upon another Alliance's ship it's our duty to apologize."

04:02:56 You say, "I know. Exactly."

04:03:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I don't like crude language when it is just used to be crude but you know I am not always clean with my language. Sometimes when something is fucked! It is just that and there's no other way to express it Love heh."

04:03:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:03:28 You laugh.

04:03:50 You say, "Yeah, but I'm not sure you'd like it if I were to tell you flat out I want to fuck you."

04:05:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So we haven't received an apology form Eli. What's up with that?"

04:06:01 You say, "No idea."

04:06:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is the least he could do."

04:06:17 You say, "He apologized over the alliance channel."

04:06:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I wasn't ther but i'm glad he did."

04:06:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There that is."

04:06:49 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:07:00 You ask, "Let's go lie down?"

04:13:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm gonna celibrate by exploration!"

04:18:39 You're already standing.

04:18:44 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

04:18:44 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

04:45:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Now I am gonna get crude when it comes to him because I just don't have anything nice to say."

04:45:53 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Works for me."

04:46:08 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:46:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh too bad he got participants."

04:47:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I read the news, and saw the messages on the message boards. What happened?"

04:47:50 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

04:48:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Turns out blowing up ships around planets is a bad idea. Who would've thought?"

04:48:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:48:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Uh Constantine and Eli crashed starships into the Spaceport to put it mildly."

04:48:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Um... Yes?"

04:48:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "It is a bad idea to do that in general. Debris rains down upon other people."

04:48:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "On purpose?"

04:49:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes."

04:49:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:49:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes."

04:49:12 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:49:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

04:49:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "It doesn't sound like they meant to crash it, but just blow it up."

04:49:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "MNo, they purposefully crashed them."

04:49:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:49:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope when you cut power to a starship and it is already moving towards a target it will most definitely crash."

04:49:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "This is true."

04:50:13 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

04:50:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm very seriously considering removing Constantine from sEAS. I will think about it for at least a couple of days though."

04:50:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Why would they do that?"

04:51:02 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:51:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:51:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Because they were protesting."

04:51:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "But their protesting has been peaceful so far, what would drive them to do that?"

04:52:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:52:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Because Ather asked them to destroy more government supported starships."

04:53:17 Shule gently strokes your hair, running his fingers through it.

04:53:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "This is getting out of hand. That sort of thing won't wor."

04:54:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:54:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So the consequences were very destructive and inflicted death and dismemberment. Constantine and Eli cut a deal with the Government though so now they have to pay very large restitution to the victims but it in turn tied our hands because they say we can't oppose Outccord which will likely bring far worse devistation to AEU citizens and AEU space than this incident did."

04:55:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah but Kaise is in charge of the outtcord negotations now. Which is good."

04:55:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:55:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Uh no."

04:55:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:56:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "When did she do that? Shes leader of the new republic party.."

04:56:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:56:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "She was against it and now she's saying she wants it completed by the end of this week. It's in the news."

04:57:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It wasn't blowing up ships that caused that Dakhal."

04:58:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Just becuase she wants it completed, doesn't mean it'll be a complete withdrawl. She might negotiate different terms for AEU's membership within the accord. She, like many of us, probably wants this mess done and over with."

04:58:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey eli."

04:58:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:58:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Also I wish that they would get her name right. She is no relation to me whatsoever! I am am so far from right wing as they are."

04:58:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm aware. I'm just commenting on how blowing them up was never a good idea."

04:58:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Hey new voice I don't think I've heard before."

04:58:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hello to you, too."

04:58:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'll call you right back."

04:58:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh she is so naive."

04:59:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's sad."

04:59:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But it's because she is just not as aware and I guess when she was coming up she likely didn't pay much attention to politics."

04:59:35 You nod.

04:59:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right now, I am so... so... so.. uh.. pissed, it's not funny. But.. what can be done about it?"

04:59:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "I mean, I cant blame you for thinking she might have turned tail, but I doubt it. I'l lbe suprised, and disgusted if she winds up making us withdraw from outcordd."

04:59:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Why so angry?"

05:00:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "What can be done about it? Don't back down all of you!"

05:01:39 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Four would be amazing."

05:01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Eli. Thoguhts on Kaise leading the negotiations?"

05:02:37 You say to Lily, "Hun, I should go to sleep. I love you. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:04:54 Lily says to you, "Nite Love I will be just a few here myself. Rest well and sweet dreams to you too."

05:06:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

05:06:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "And I know that you are pissed about the crashing and the like. I would be too... I can't be pissed about it though because I wasn't there and don't know all the... The skim? No the bubble doesn't take the skim."

05:07:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was there for it... I narrowly became a part of it."

05:07:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline blows out a breath. "I can see why you would be pissed."

05:10:40 You whisper to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:10:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident giggles at you.

05:10:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

05:57:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Or something like that and I just replied here, because I'm in essance a derp."

05:58:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Either that or very tired, either way."

11:40:53 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

11:41:00 You scramble to your feet.

11:41:00 [Starship "William Dove"; Observation Deck]
You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, and a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing white and light blue aquatic life and coral rocks here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

11:41:20 You remove a small suitcase from a leather briefcase.

11:41:22 Open what?

11:41:26 You open a small suitcase.

11:41:32 You need a free hand to take that.

11:41:40 I don't understand that.

11:41:40 Try this instead:  wear put secondary

11:41:48 You put a secondary pilot command access unit in a leather briefcase.

11:41:53 You remove a pair of white cotton briefs from a small suitcase.

11:42:27 You put a small suitcase in a leather briefcase.

11:42:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Observation Deck]

11:42:29 You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing white and light blue aquatic life and coral rocks, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.

[The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

11:42:31 You can't go that way.

11:42:33 [The Torus; Garage]

11:42:33 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

11:42:37 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

11:42:37 You can go out and enter into the ship.

Want to know if anyone's relaxing in a public venue? Check WHERE!

11:42:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

11:42:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:42:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:42:58 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:42:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:42:59 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

11:43:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:43:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:43:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:43:05 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:43:06 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

11:43:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:43:08 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

11:43:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:43:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:43:10 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

11:43:13 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

11:43:14 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

11:43:40 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

11:43:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

11:43:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:43:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

11:44:01 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

11:44:24 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:44:24 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:44:56 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

11:51:05 You remove a silver plastic paper dispenser from a leather briefcase.

11:51:10 Use what?

11:51:22 Automatic daily maintenance is now underway. This will not affect your connectivity, but the game may feel less responsive for the next few minutes.

11:51:24 You put a silver plastic paper dispenser in a leather briefcase.

11:51:38 I see no "dispenser fro briefcase" here.

Dear Nissi,
Around midnight on September 26, a call went out over tactical indicating that Chet's was being sieged. Morris called for crew at Old Earth and as I was still discussing it with others, I did not have time to respond before the crew filled up. Choosing to respond in my flare, I went directly over to Chet's Bar and Grill. By the time I made it there, Morris was already there in his hammerhead and informed me that they got it. I responded over general sector that I was there to help and that he always called me off.
I have to say that this is not the first time  he has done this. On another occasion many months back, a call went out over tactical indicating that a League sector was on alert. Since I was already in my ship, I arrived and reported on the situation indicating I was already there. Morris called me off again and didn't even offer me so much as a thank you for staying to help defend League space.
Returning to the events of September 26th, another call went out over tactical indicating that Dusty Reaches had pirates there. I announced over tactical that I was on my way and would check it out. Having formed my crew, I headed over to Dusty Reaches to check it out and while I was on my way, someone else reported the number of ships. I stayed with my crew to fight.
Now, during the course of the battle, the League cruiser fired on my ship. When Lily asked people over tactical to watch their locks, Morris r
11:52:28 esponded something along the lines of "Sorry we hurt your pretty little ship..
This indicates to me that Morris had no regrets about hitting a civilian ship of an alliance with which the League has a non-aggression Pact. Accidental weapon hits is one thing and we would have brushed it off if he had apologized and not made a comment like that. I have never intentionally fired on a League ship and most certainly do not get upset if League ships respond to help defend human alliance space. However, he should be warned that if this type of incident happens again and he responds in a like manner, we may not consider it accidental and more than likely consider it a violation of the NAP between the AEU and the League. Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
Best Regards,
Shule Elemmire

12:04:30 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

12:04:31 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

12:04:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:04:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:04:33 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:04:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:04:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:04:39 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can crew, but I can't fly against that."

12:04:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:05:01 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Meet me on Chetumal then?"

12:05:05 [Tactical Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I can fly."

12:05:12 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:05:12 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:05:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

12:05:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:05:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:05:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:05:19 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

12:05:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:06:01 You peer out...

12:06:01 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can, and Vartija the arachnoid security robot here.
Evenia Callseah is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

12:34:35 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

12:34:35 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

12:37:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:37:08 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

12:37:09 You peer out...

12:37:09 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner", the four-person mule "Lion's Den", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

13:11:11 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

13:11:12 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

GUIDELINES
--
The Space Defense Captain is a very important position. Although the pilot corps is not military, and although you are not actually in command of it, your corps elected you as Captain because they feel you are best qualified to organize the defense of their space. This is what they will expect you to do, and this is what your government will expect you to do.

You are not Captain just to fly big warships into battle (although that may often be the best way to handle a situation). The Captain is an organizational and a leadership position. When invaders come, you are the one with a plan. Even if you are not available to be in space at the moment, you are the one who created the plan that your fellow pilots now implement without you. You are not THE defender of the alliance. You help your alliance defend itself.

Your office terminal allows you several tools to help you organize a defense. First and most obviously, your terminal is hooked into the alliance's tactical sensors. This is similar to your public flight control scanner, but provides more detailed information for every sector held by your alliance. You may also view sector starmaps from your office, any sector belonging to your alliance as well as any sector your alliance has a ship in. Finally, you may send messages to all ships of your alliance, and your terminal will receive communications in reply.

Starship combat is not easy. While the Indu
13:38:32 strial Whip encourages and teaches pilots to be more productive, your role is to encourage and teach pilots to fight effectively in their own defense. Make yourself available to assist others, and create plans that your fellow pilots can implement with or without you. One hero cannot defend an entire alliance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

20:07:02 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:27:52 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:27:52 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:27:53 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:27:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I got your letter Shule."

20:27:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:27:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:27:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh good."

20:28:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll put it in the voice records."

20:28:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:28:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thank you."

20:28:15 Which sector did you mean?

20:28:15 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

20:28:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:28:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:28:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

20:28:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:28:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:28:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just so you guys know, I did offer to resign my commission, but I doubt the government will accept it."

20:28:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:28:23 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

20:28:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:28:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:28:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:28:28 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:28:30 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

20:28:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "The term is nearly over anyway. I didn't reapply, of course."

20:28:37 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

20:28:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:29:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "YEah, the term is nearly over."

20:29:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:29:07 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

20:29:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:29:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:29:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:29:27 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:29:45 The AEU did not reach any of its performance goals.

20:29:45 Top Performers: Kaiulani Greben, Johnathon Triggs, and Rahab Cassidy.

20:30:08 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:30:08 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:30:23 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:30:24 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:30:55 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:32:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You do realize though Constantine that if nobody else runs for Voice, you will be Voice again by default?"

20:33:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't realize that."

20:33:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "If that happens, I guess I'll just do the best I can."

20:33:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I figured no one would want me holding office again."

20:36:22 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

20:45:51 You remove a secondary pilot command access unit from a leather briefcase.

20:46:39 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

20:46:47 I don't understand that.

20:46:49 The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 268" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

20:46:50 You hold Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

20:47:18 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

20:47:28 The one-person cargo hauler "Grace" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

20:47:29 The reactionless drive of the one-person cargo hauler "Grace" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

20:47:30 Rahab Cassidy exits from the one-person cargo hauler "Grace".

20:47:36 Constantine Stone waves.

20:47:43 Rahab Cassidy waves.

20:47:43 You wave to Rahab Cassidy.

20:47:46 Rahab Cassidy

20:47:46 She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has freckled skin. Her body is full-figured with attractively curved hips and thick calves. She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is round, lightly-freckled, and plain, with an arched nose and round chin. Her lips are plump and reddish pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of plucked eyebrows, her eyes are grey and round. Her mid-back length, wavy hair is light honey brown and neatly combed. She has long clear fingernails. She has a flashy pale pink crystal snowflake hairpin in her hair. She has a small mole on her neck.
 She is wearing a pale pink satin v-neck tee, a platinum watch with a round face, a pair of faded blue jeans, and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a red metachannel FTL communicator, a small cloth sack, a flight control scanner, an alliance information assistant, and a standard starship flightbag. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, left wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

20:47:47 Rahab Cassidy says, "That took much longer than I thought."

20:47:50 You hold Rahab Cassidy's hand, taking her into your group.

20:47:53 You say, "No problem."

20:47:56 [The Torus; Garage]

20:47:57 You can go up.
Constantine Stone and Rahab Cassidy followed you.

20:48:00 The one-person cargo hauler "Grace" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

20:48:01 Board what?

20:48:05 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

20:48:05 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Constantine Stone and Rahab Cassidy followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:48:06 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:48:07 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Constantine Stone and Rahab Cassidy followed you.

20:48:10 You disband your group.

20:48:12 Constantine Stone walks south.

20:48:12 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:48:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:48:18 Rahab Cassidy mosies up.

20:48:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:48:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:48:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:48:27 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 322! Welcome to The Torus!"

20:48:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:48:39 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Now Rahab, you can use any weapon you like as long as it's lasers."

20:48:43 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 322" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

20:50:58 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So you'll see Shule targeting them first."

20:51:04 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yeah, they're kind of annoying."

20:51:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:51:20 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "They're not as common in ships smaller than destroyers, but you get tons of very high strength beacons, even in fighters."

20:51:20 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok, here we go."

20:51:21 Rahab Cassidy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Do they usually show up with this sort of a ship? Or are we doing a higher level beacon?"

20:51:32 Rahab Cassidy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Aha."

20:51:33 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "No, they don't usually show up for this type of ship."

20:51:35 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We'll do a high, and this is a destroyer, so we may get one."

20:51:38 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh."

I did not track or have you fire on his ship yesterday nor will I ever until they break it. I will not be the one to make the first offense."

22:30:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know it was him that hit you, but maybe he didn't do it on purpose, you know?"

22:30:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Is that basically what she said?"

22:30:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Once I responded to a sector alert with Jacob Smitt, and were both in fighters, and I accidentally locked onto him and shot at him a couple times before I realized it."

22:30:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I said I was sorry and it was all good."

22:31:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, but sarcastic remarks aren't the best things to say during that kind of accident."

22:31:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I agree."

22:31:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "He shouldn't have been so flippant about it."

22:31:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly."

22:31:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "100%, you're right. But I think what Nissi's worried about, and I can see where she's coming from, is that a personal feud might escalate and increase tensions between the AEU and league."

22:32:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And we really don't need that, especially right now."

22:33:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I agree, but my ob is to look out for the welfare of our pilots."

22:33:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Job too."

22:33:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I understand that."

22:34:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hate to say it, but I think it might be a little bit more on us to make sure we maintain good relations. Everyone is on edge about the action the fleet took against the mutuality, and any kind of threats are going to look like more warmongering."

22:34:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And I don't need our pilots, responding to space combat situation and being worried that Morris's ship is going to fire on them and be rude about it."

22:34:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just something to think about."

22:35:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I do see you point. Nissi said she talked to him about it, and I do believe her."

22:35:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't dealt with her much, but I think we can take her at her word."

22:35:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Lily and I responded in order to try to show that we were willing to help defend the Mutuality. Morris interfered in that."

22:35:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And you guys were totally in the right to do so."

22:35:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm glad you did."

22:36:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, that's all I ask. It's fine if she talked to him about it and I believe her too."

22:37:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Next time, I'm just going to stay in the sector and help defend the Mutuality. Screw what Morris says."

22:37:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The AEU civilian pilots need to at least show that we're willing to defend the Mutuality."

22:37:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think that would be fine. I agree that any other League pilot responding would have been happy to have the help."

22:38:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh Ather, you got your status back, great."

22:38:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli asked me yesterday to ask them to restore it."

22:38:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I agree. Heck, I have no problem if other pilots show up to help defend the AEU. Just as long as when we go help to defend their space, they don't shoo us away like annoying little` flies."

22:38:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Seems that they did."

22:39:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For the record I did ask that they accept my resignation, but they haven't done so."

22:39:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They actually did it? That's good news."

22:39:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I won't apply for the next term, though, for what that's worth."

22:39:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I just nominated myself for the next term. Time to undo a few things."

22:39:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good to hear it."

22:39:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Glad you got your status back."

22:39:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wait, you nominated yourself for SDC next term, Ather?"

22:40:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think he meant voice."

22:40:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The Mutuality council much to their consternation I'm sure, are going to need to deal with me, again for the next term or two."

22:40:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, I was ready to go remove my nomination for SDC."

22:41:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:41:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:41:11 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:41:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:41:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:41:17 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 268! Welcome to home space!"

22:41:23 The ship is already moving.

22:41:25 The ship is already moving.

22:41:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:41:26 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:41:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:41:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:41:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:41:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:41:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:41:34 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:41:35 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:41:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:41:36 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

22:41:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:41:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:41:39 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:41:40 AutoStar detects 4 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

22:41:42 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

22:41:42 There are no other ships in the sector.

22:41:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:42:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:42:06 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:42:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:42:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:42:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:42:22 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

22:42:22 You pull a large lever towards you.

Subject: the end of the AEU strike
Author: Ather Jammoa
Posted: 20:46 26 September 2317 GST

With the end of the AEU Pilot Corps strike, Space invaders at least, will once again participate in the building of temporary stations. All station builders who have access to invaders warehouse are free to send me letters asking for any parts that they might need, if they're not in the warehouse already. If there is a station builder who I overlooked for the access list, send me a letter notifying me, so that I can add you as well.
