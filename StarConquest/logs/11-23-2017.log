03:00 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]

03:00 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Future Crimes"; Docking Bay.
You see a long plasteel counter, a glossy pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a pair of soft mystic purple slippers, a pair of supple silver flight boots, and a pair of white leather boots here.
You can go out.

03:00  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of white socks. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

03:01 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:01 You wave. "Hi everyone."

03:01 Lily says to you, "Well hello stranger!"

03:01 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:01 Evenia Callseah nods to you.

03:01 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:01 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:01 Evenia says to you, "I'm taking us into andy's shortly. From there we're gonna charge up. And then. Onward."

03:02 You say to Evenia, "Ah ok. Cool."

03:02 Evenia Callseah absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:02 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

03:02 "Thing thing!" Evenia Callseah points at Eli Grey.

03:02 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yum meatdogs!"

03:02 You grin.

03:02 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:02 Lily Kaise says, "She will be a happy lizie."

03:03 You say, "For sure."

03:03 You are carrying nothing.

03:03 Lily Kaise says, "Will have to wait though as I fed her yesterday and she still looks quite full."

03:04 You say, "I'll eat a meat dog for her."

03:04 Lily Kaise giggles at you.

03:04 You grin.

03:04 Lily says to you, "Me too!"

03:04 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:04 Evenia Callseah says, "I'll get some for thor, if..."

03:04 Lily Kaise asks, "Oh my she still hasen't come out of her supor?"

03:05 Lily Kaise sighs.

03:05 Evenia Callseah shakes her head.

03:05 "It's ok." Eli Grey pats Evenia Callseah on the back. "I'm sure soon we'l find Thor somewhere in the ship, with an Aisling shaped bulge inside it."

03:05 Lily Kaise says, "This is very worrisome."

03:05 You ask, "What's up with Thor?"

03:05 Evenia Callseah nods to Lily Kaise. "It is."

03:05 Evenia Callseah says, "He's starving on Aisling's shoulder. I can't feed him."

03:05 Lily Kaise says, "He looked as though he was starving."

03:05 Lily Kaise nods to Evenia Callseah.

03:05 You exclaim, "Oh dear. That's sad!"

03:05 Eli says to you, "Ash has been pretty out of it and yeah, he's like skin and bones."

03:05 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

03:06 You frown.

03:06 Evenia Callseah stands up from a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered gold dragons.

03:06 Evenia Callseah mosies down.

03:06 Lily Kaise asks, "I saw that and I didn't know if he'd make it through today. Has anyone seen him move at all?"

03:06 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

03:06 The hovertruck smoothly negotiates a turn, tilting slightly so you are not thrown off the trailer.

03:06 Eli Grey asks, "I think I saw him flick his tongue out?"

03:06 Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

03:06 Evenia Callseah mosies in from below.

03:06 Evenia Callseah sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered gold dragons.

03:07 Lily Kaise says, "Poor thing probably barely ahs any energy."

03:07 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:07 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm sure Ash hasn't intended this to happen. She takes amazing care of Thor usually. It just upsets me. I wanna help him."

03:07 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

03:07 Eli Grey nods to Evenia Callseah.

03:07 Lily Kaise says, "I know we don't want people randomly feeding our lizards but something ahs to be done."

(You are sitting on a black leather sectional sofa with a d
03:07 eep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.)

03:08 Eli Grey says, "If I ever get a lizard, you guys can feed him whatever you want. It'll love it."

03:08 You grin at Eli Grey.

03:08 Eli Grey says, "He'll be the fattest little lizard, and we can roll him around like a ball."

03:08 You say, "Same here. Except felo. Don't feed my lizard felo."

03:08 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well if I know I might not be able to take care of Asteria, I put her down or give her to Shule or would give her to someone who I trust would take care of her."

03:08 Evenia Callseah says, "I wish when they got to this stage. The lizards would just reach out their beautiful heads and take anything. From anyone. Life preservation. All that."

03:08 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:08 Lily Kaise says, "Me too."

03:08 Lily Kaise says, "Or jsut jump down."

03:09 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise. "Yeah, on a ship like this you can just let 'em roam and they'll get fed lots heh."

03:09 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

03:09 Lily Kaise says, "We generally do."

03:09 Lily Kaise removes a blacklight poster of a featureless black circle in space which bends starlight around it from a camera bag.

03:09 Evenia Callseah says, "I love it. I love watching them walk around."

03:09 Eli Grey says, "I used to hunt down all the lizards running around on Nissi's ship during an expidition and feed them, just for fun really. Most of the time they'd already been fed."

03:09 Lily Kaise puts a blacklight poster of a featureless black circle in space which bends starlight around it in a camera bag.

03:09 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:09 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

03:10 Eli Grey says, "Fucking Zeus ate my whole bag of chips."

03:10 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

03:10 Evenia Callseah says, "They're just like. "Yeah. What's up. I'm like. A lizard. I'm awesome. And there's no fucking rush. Ever.""

03:10 Evenia Callseah says, "And then they're like. "Hey. I know I'm full. But feed me you fuckers. Or I'll eat you.""

03:10 Lily Kaise removes a brightly colored poster of a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a Tardick lizard named Zeus, and a Tardick lizard named Isis from a camera bag.

03:10 Lily Kaise puts down a brightly colored poster of a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a Tardick lizard named Zeus, and a Tardick lizard named Isis.

03:10 Eli Grey grins.

03:10 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:11 Lily Kaise says, "I found them all together and I couldn't resist."

03:11 You exclaim, "That's awesome!"

03:11 Lily Kaise nods.

03:11 Evenia Callseah sighs.

03:11 Evenia Callseah says, "None of us know what happened to her."

03:11 Evenia Callseah says, "Isis."

03:11 Lily Kaise asks, "So where's Lillian's lizard?"

03:12 You say, "That's a really good question."

03:12 Lily Kaise sighs.

03:12 Evenia Callseah says, "We don't know. I've asked Mel. She doesn't know either. It's more than a bit upsetting. I hope she's found somewhere to curl up. Hibernate maybe."

03:12 You say, "I hope so too."

03:12 Lily Kaise says, "Oh gods yes."

03:12 Lily Kaise picks up a brightly colored poster of a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a Tardick lizard named Zeus, and a Tardick lizard named Isis.

03:13 Eli Grey says, "That said come to the looal. Come and perch and nest."

03:13 Lily Kaise puts a brightly colored poster of a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a Tardick lizard named Zeus, and a Tardick lizard named Isis in a camera bag.

03:13 Evenia Callseah grins at Eli Grey.

03:13 Evenia Callseah flaps her arms at Eli Grey.

03:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:13 Eli Grey asks, "Maybe Lilian took the lizard wherever it was that she went?"

03:13 Eli Grey flaps his arms at Evenia Callseah.

03:14 Evenia Callseah says, "Maybe. But we don't know either way. We know she hasn't retired, so..."

03:14 Evenia Callseah shrugs.

03:14 Lily Kaise says, "I'm sorry I took that out. It just occurred to me that I hadn't seen Isis in a long long time."

03:15 Evenia Callseah smiles at Lily Kaise.

03:15 Evenia says to Lily, "Don't be sorry, it's a cool poster. It just made me think is all."

03:16 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but makes me a bit sad as I counted about 8 Lizards amongst pilots and now we may be down to half a dozen."

03:16 Evenia Callseah asks, "Thor. Yours. Nissi's. Anfisa's. Zeus...who am I missing?"

03:16 Lily Kaise says, "It's just unfortunate that they're not as well cared for as one would think."

03:17 An arc of light much like a meteor draws itself in the sky overhead.

03:18 Evenia Callseah says, "It makes me furious. So many people treat them like objects. They seem to forget they're real creatures. They need care. They need love, and they need to be protected. Sure I don't own a lizard, but I share Zeus with Mel, and so that's something. But it really fucking pisses me off the way some have been treated."

03:18 Evenia Callseah says, "And I'm gonna shut up now before I start ranting."

03:20 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I totally agree! Asteria is my pet and coming from someone who took in as many stray cats as our barn would accomodate and the nice ones we brought into our house, I love creatures of all sorts and if I take them in, it's my obligation to cherish and care for them."

03:20 Evenia Callseah nods to Lily Kaise.

03:20 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:21 Evenia Callseah says, "Like whenever I have Zeus, every night before I sleep I put him down. That way if I wake up late or something, someone can feed him. I never take that risk."

03:21 Lily Kaise nods.

03:21 You say, "Yeah, Lily does the same thing."

03:21 Lily Kaise says, "Well I generally do that with Asteria unless I'm traveling. I trust the ship will land but I want to have her safe with me incase something unforeseen happens."

03:21 Evenia Callseah says, "I mean I know they can go something like a week without feeding, but you get what I mean. I'm always super careful."

03:22 Lily Kaise nods.

03:22 Lily Kaise says, "She is generally roaming my platform."

03:22 Lily Kaise grins.

03:23 You grin.

03:24 Evenia Callseah stands up from a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered gold dragons.

03:24 Evenia Callseah mosies down.

03:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:28 The hovertruck spends several minutes overtaking a hovercar. Nobody appears to be in its driver's seat.

03:37 Eli Grey says, "No of discarding."

03:37 Eli Grey stands up from a traditional round gray zafu.

03:37 Eli Grey wanders down.

03:37 Evenia Callseah blinks.

03:37 Evenia Callseah asks, "What's he on about now?"

03:37 You shrug. "No idea."

03:38 Evenia Callseah says, "Me neither. It's eli. You never know."

03:39 Evenia Callseah stands up from a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered gold dragons.

03:41 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

03:42 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

03:47 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 544490926 at Northwest and Slightly Down: "Halloo all travelers! Please to visit Famous Andy's Trading Post! Purchase fine imported items from alliances! Resupply! Rest a while!"

03:47 Several soldiers run by, rifles at the ready and bayonets fixed.

03:47 Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for protection.

03:48 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

03:59 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:59 Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

03:59 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:59 You say, "I know. I'd love to stay up and grab a meat dog."

03:59 Lily says to you, "Ok i'll get some extra meatdogs for you."

03:59 You say to Lily, "Awww, thanks."

03:59 You beam at Lily Kaise.

04:00 You say to Lily, "Night."

04:00 Lily Kaise says, "Maybe we'll still be there when you wake up but if not, they'll keep for a little while."

04:00 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:00 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:00 You stand up from a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

04:00 Lily Kaise whispers, "Nite and I love you."

04:00 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Time for me to go rest."

04:00 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well."

04:00 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

04:00 Lily Kaise beams at you.

04:01 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:01 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:01 Lily says to you, "Rest well."

04:01 You're already standing.

11:43 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Future Crimes"; Docking Bay.

[Famous Andy's Trading Post; Docking Bay]
Though Andy's Trading Post is located in the proverbial middle of nowhere, the docking bay is large by any standard, accommodating a good number of rickety-looking carriers and transports surrounded by swarms of workers, well-armed security guards, and sprawling piles of crated cargo. The bay is roughly square and is enclosed by walls formed of a patchwork of steel plates with more laid overhead into a high flat ceiling, each plate held in place by large bolts and thick, lumpy welds. Metal lattices cover the walls, ceiling, and deck, keeping tangles of cables and grimy ductwork safely out of the way. A massive airlock on the south side of the bay allows starship arrivals and departures, while a ramp leads downward from the north side, where a very large poster is prominently displayed. Wide hatches lead into corridors extending east and west. The oil-scented air here is a bit smoky, and the gravity is approximately two-thirds of Earth standard.
The four-person combat support carrier "Future Crimes" is landed here.
You see a Feng Wo Collective service robot and a large recycle bin here.
You can go east, west, and down.
