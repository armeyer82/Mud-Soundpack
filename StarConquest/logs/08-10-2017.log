00:13:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Is that our scooping station?"

00:14:14 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:14:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:14:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:14:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:14:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:14:43 The ship is already moving.

00:14:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:14:46 The computer says, "Destination selected. Five jumps to Olivia's Pearl Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:14:47 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:14:47 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

00:14:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:14:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:14:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:14:54 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: c/$vxI4i}!e'4\zR$>1=.|(`aE#=NQM'6"L'h\YE
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Four jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:14:55 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

00:14:56 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:14:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:14:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:15:00 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:15:00 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

00:15:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:15:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:15:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:15:05 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:15:05 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

00:15:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:15:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:15:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:15:10 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:15:10 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Olivia's Pearl Orbit."

00:15:11 The starship is already moving.

00:15:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:15:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:15:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:15:15 A large gas giant floats here, glowing bright white in the light of its suns. The surface appears regular and still, but certainly that's merely an illusion.

02:16:15 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That sounds pretty nice. That is, unless I get locked in said carrier and nobody hears from me for months."

02:17:38 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Not sure if it's worth putting an accelerator out there though, since the station is going down in like 6 hours."

02:17:58 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well yeah, but Constantine will put another up."

02:18:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Or he'll make Shule do it."

03:27:57 [Asteroid Surface]
You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

03:28:00 You lower an asteroid anchor to the ground and press a button on its side.  The anchor seeks the best angle downwards.

03:28:00 (11 seconds roundtime.)

03:28:11 Suddenly, an asteroid anchor leaps from your hand and buries itself in the ground.  You feel vibrations through your boots as the anchor secures itself in the surface of the asteroid.

03:28:12 You begin to painstakingly secure a coil of neutronium-threaded line to an asteroid anchor.

03:28:12 (53 seconds roundtime.)

03:29:06 You step back and tug on the free end of the line, note that it seems secure, and decide to move on to the next step.

04:35:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:35:57 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

04:36:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:36:06 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:36:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

04:36:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:36:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:36:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:10:45 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:10:45 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:12:05 [MTTS] Ulias: Hahaha, those last two announcements together, almost made me spit cola on my computer.

21:12:22 [MTTS] something: Poor sad fringers.

21:13:22 [MTTS] andawn: Really liking how these are written.

21:16:00 [MTTS] alc_71: These files are very detailed. I love it.

21:16:33 [MTTS] andawn: How much would say, a league pilot, know about fringe or AEU polotics?

21:16:38 [MTTS] canpher: I'm going to have to hit google hard later since I'm not very smart.

21:17:22 [MTTS] something: I'm guessing a pilot could find a lot of this out if they really wanted to?

21:18:01 [MTTS] Squidmind: That's a difficult question to answer due to the nature of what you're asking.  How much would a German citizen know about Australian politics?

21:18:22 [MTTS] andawn: But how much, say, would the fringe dictatorship sensor information on the other alliance's polaticks systems.

21:18:34 [MTTS] something: I mean, if they're a well informed person who cares about politics.

21:18:41 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yes, if someone actually took the effort to find it out, they could easily learn about the intricacies of how the governments of the other alliances worked.

21:19:08 [MTTS] alc_71: I am guessing it would depend on the interest of each individual pilot. Some are just not into politics and so would maybe only know what they have to know about their own politics.

21:19:23 [MTTS] Squidmind: The average non-pilot probably doesn't know much about the other alliances at all since they have no contact with them.

21:19:32 [MTTS] canpher: I'm probably only going to really look into the bits that align with my character's outlook.

21:19:57 [MTTS] Squidmind: Civilian pilots, members of the governments, and people who have reason to interact with the other alliances, would be the ones who'd have reason to gain the knowledge.

21:20:11 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

21:20:16 [MTTS] andawn: Thank you. I just wanted to know how much i'd be allowd to bring this up in rollplay, if at all, due to sensorship and the like.

21:20:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "When are most of these out of comms people due to return?"

21:21:09 [MTTS] andawn: Also, a completely unrelated question somewhat, how much does the fringe government sensor the media?

21:21:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think the Feng Wo trip should return tomorrow or Saturday."

21:21:33 [MTTS] Squidmind: Before becoming a civilian pilot the average person would know who the president of the League/AEU was and that the Fringe was led by a military dictator, but beyond that they probably wouldn't know, care, or have reason to find out - regardless of alliance.

21:23:16 [MTTS] something: Would the trend set by Trump in the real world of people noticing politics because of the ridiculousness involved be applicable to the AEU? Or does the lack of information technologies make it less of a conversation point.

21:24:19 [MTTS] andawn: I did notice a similarity betweene best and trump. I did have a bit of a chuckle about that.

21:26:09 [MTTS] Squidmind: Even in the real world there is a LOT of support for current American policies.  But to answer your question the majority of the AEU population voted for the National Patriots and they were fairly clear on what they would do once in power.

21:26:51 [MTTS] andawn: I think it would be interesting if the election speeches were on the holovids.

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

21:55:00 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

21:55:09 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

21:55:11 You glance at your communicator's screen.

21:55:11 Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Pilots, as we enter the last ten days of the term, I wanted to congratulate everyone for doing a great job. If my accounting is accurate, we only lost three ships this term, and only two of those were lost in combat. Since those losses, we've done a great job responding to sector alerts, and we even responded to an attack on Accord command -- something I hope they'll remember about us, regardless of what else may happen. We've also been putting up great beacon numbers. It has been a while since the last update, but I want to say that about 45% of the beacons done this term have been done on AEU ships, which is a higher number than I've ever seen. Part of this may be due to the extended absence of other pilots, but the work we've done is still nothing to sneeze at. Finally, I'd like to thank the new pilots for their help in keeping our home sectors free of RATs as much as possible. Celebrate our collective success by doing a fighter beacon or two in these last few conquests of the term -- remember that troubled times are ahead, and keeping our skills sharp may help us all in the long run.

21:56:12 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:56:12 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:47:29 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]

22:47:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a decoy beacon launcher here.
Constantine Stone is standing here.

23:14:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:15:03 I don't understand that.

23:15:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:15:06 I don't understand that.

23:15:08 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

23:15:08 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.
