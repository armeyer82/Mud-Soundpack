00:29:46 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

00:32:46 Mischief the large black felo jumps onto a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it and immediately settles in.

00:32:46 Mischief the large black felo lies down and curls up into a tight ball, closes its eyes, and appears to sleep.

00:34:47 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

00:35:46 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior grows still, then flips upside down and bobs to the top of the tank.

00:39:47 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

01:00:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

01:01:46 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

01:02:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slumps in a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt and Mischief the sleeping large black felo on it and goes to sleep.

01:07:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

01:07:46 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:07:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

01:09:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:09:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Constantine, I've been considering these missions and when I can, I am probably going to see if I can convince shule that we probably shouldn't go for them."

01:10:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it's probably for the best. I just think undertaking them even as an experiment might do more harm than good."

01:10:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oops, miscom, but yeah."

01:11:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:11:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I agree. I don't mind a few broken bones but what worries me if those violent types out may be using all kinds of evil stuff. I doubt it's anything like what we're acustomed to under typical ground combat conditions."

01:11:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And if it is indeed combat, I'd be worried about the targets, as well. Surely they don't have suits."

01:12:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:12:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That is true."

01:13:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:13:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Now if I could patrol the streets with my arachnoid along with me and if I find someone who is getting out of hand and can stun them a little and get them to a Security office, that's one thing but having to do this in battlesuits is... yeah."

01:15:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed. Bringing our giant walking weapons platforms into it is going to escalate things."

01:16:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Civilian pilots have no part, and should have no part in maintaining the peace on any of the AEU worlds. That's not our job. It is, additionally, not our job to silence the people. If there is someone committing a crime, it should be handled via the natural progression of alliance laws, not under marshall law and a virtual tribunal."

01:18:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's only going to cast us in a worse light if we start helping the current administration enforce their new tyrannical policies."

01:19:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I agree."

01:19:46 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

01:20:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "If you agree, then I strongly and ever so politely suggest that you keep your ideas about stunning common AEU citizens private."

01:21:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So I will not let curiosity get the best of me and they can have their so-called peace-keeping missions as I believe they want to exploit us big time and it is their job to police and not ours."

01:22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then call off Shule if you can, because he's not responding to alliance comms."

01:23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No matter what way, shape or form he's there in, it's going to cause a lot of damage."

01:23:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:23:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "He's right here beside me and taking a nap so I will certainly discuss it with him."

01:25:18 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

01:25:48 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.

01:37:46 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

01:38:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt and Mischief the sleeping large black felo on it.

01:38:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a corpse of a large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior from a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

01:38:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Poor red jellyfish."

01:38:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

01:39:18 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

01:39:46 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

01:40:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

01:40:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt and Mischief the sleeping large black felo on it.

01:42:48 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

01:49:45 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:53:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "In light of the recent actions of President Best's administration of trying to encourage members of the AEU civilian pilot corps to use powered armor to threaten and intimidate citizens of the Union so that they will obey his demands, we will be standing outside of the new phoenix spaceport security center and launching a peaceful protest. Anyone is welcome to come."

01:53:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Right now, Eli?"

01:53:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll join at about 12:30."

01:53:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, we're out thre right now."

01:53:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident scrambles to her feet.

01:53:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

01:53:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's fine man, ti's sudden."

01:54:13 You peer out...

01:54:13 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", the four-person light carrier "You Have Clearance To Launch", and the two-person Accord gemini "Cherry Cola Float" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

01:55:08 You say, "I think I'll go join that protest."

01:55:17 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:55:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

01:55:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a small red insulated cooler from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

01:55:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a day old piping room temperature turnover filled with meatball from a small red insulated cooler.

01:55:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident dangles a day old piping room temperature turnover filled with meatball in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

01:55:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides north.

01:55:43 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

01:55:43 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt and Mischief the sleeping large black felo on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

01:56:01 You peer northeast...

01:56:01 
[New Earth; Trading Center]
The trading center seems to be one of the busiest places in the spaceport. Which is not surprising, considering the profits that successful trading can bring in. Avoiding the automated computer terminals used by the career traders, you decide to approach a human trade clerk. This, incidentally, will also subject your purchases and sales to less scrutiny.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go southwest.

01:56:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the northeast.

01:56:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides east.

01:56:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey quickly drains a bloody mary.

01:56:13 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey drops a glass.

01:56:13 As soon as a glass hits the ground, it suddenly shatters into a billion pieces, never to be seen again.

01:56:14 You wave.

01:56:14 Johann Schraft nods to you.

01:56:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

01:56:21 Morris says to Eli, "Don't litter."

01:56:21 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey waves.

01:56:45 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:56:54 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey removes an unetched steel plaque from Eli Grey's workbench.

01:57:00 Morris Corlew gives a bottle to a sanitation drone, which dumps it unceremoniously into its compressor.

01:57:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Asteria is o going to protest too She will certainly stick out her tonge."

01:57:06 Morris Corlew pats a sanitation drone lightly.

01:57:07 Johann Schraft says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "If anything happens, sir Humberton is in my siteseer and will need food."

01:57:19 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:57:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

01:57:29 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "We should not allow anyone to threaten our citizens with powered armor. Organize peaceful protests before it's too late, and be heard! First the regime would see us removed from the Accord, then they would seek to take our voices away from us. They will keep taking and taking from our freedoms until we have nothing left! We can't let this happen."

01:57:46 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods east.

01:57:47 Damien Alexander tramps in from the east.

01:57:50 Katina says to Ather, "Where is Skipper?"

01:57:53 Johann Schraft nods to Damien Alexander.

01:58:01 Katina Faye waves to Damien Alexander.

01:58:03 Damien Alexander waves.

01:58:04 Johann Schraft says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Sure."

01:58:05 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "He's in obliteration."

01:58:13 You wave to Damien Alexander.

01:58:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pats a Tardick lizard named Asteria lightly.

01:58:26 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Come on tell 'em."

01:58:40 Katina says to Ather, "May I spend time with him like I spent time with Zeus?"

01:58:46 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:58:50 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

01:58:56 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:59:03 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Probably best to do so with supervision first."

01:59:08 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Skipper is."

01:59:08 Morris attempts to sit on a sanitation drone and immediately gets jolted off as it moves.

01:59:09 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Special."

01:59:10 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Don't let them make you live in fear! Pilots should not be made into a brute squad in battle suits!"

01:59:11 Johann Schraft says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Nothing but Treble."

01:59:18 Damien Alexander chuckles at Johann Schraft.

01:59:19 Katina nods softly to Ather.

01:59:37 Katina Faye laughs at Morris Corlew.

01:59:40 Katina says to Morris, "Morris."

01:59:43 Morris says to Katina, "Wut."

01:59:45 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods southwest.

01:59:54 Morris watches the drone as it goes.

02:00:04 Katina says to Morris, "You are a goof ball."

02:00:09 Morris says to Katina, "Thanks!"

02:00:21 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "Civilian pilots, you can stop this too! The best way is to join us, here and now! Another way is to not undertake these new missions. Yet another, is to persist in the ongoing strike until the administration starts to see sense!"

02:00:21 Evenia Callseah stalks in from the east.

02:00:22 Cloak the security hoverbot floats in after Evenia Callseah.
Dagger the security hoverbot floats in after Evenia Callseah.

02:00:24 Damien says to Eli, "I was afraid that was what they wanted, with the battlesuits."

02:00:28 Katina says to Morris, "Trying to sit on the sanitation drone."

02:00:30 Katina Faye giggles.

02:00:34 Morris says to Katina, "And?"

02:00:37 Morris Corlew grins.

02:00:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:00:46 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:00:49 Katina Faye looks at Morris Corlew and shrugs. "Just never saw that before and made me laugh."

02:00:52 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] 160,000,000.00 credits have been deducted from the starship support fund.

02:00:53 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "The results are in!"

02:00:53 Evenia Callseah salutes the group.

02:00:59 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We did not achieve any of our performance goals."

02:00:59 Morris Corlew says, "Was hopin it'd take me for a ride like Best is takin the AEU citizenry for a ride. But just like them...I bout landed on my hind end."

02:00:59 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Our performance was up -515.6% from the last Conquest period."

02:01:06 Katina hides a smile.

02:01:10 Damien Alexander says into his indigo metachannel FTL communicator, "Well, alright."

02:01:13 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa chortles.

02:01:16 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Woo."

02:01:20 Keying her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, Evenia Callseah cheers.

02:01:24 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa recites:

02:01:25  
          ""Our performance was up -515.6% from the last Conquest period.""
 

02:01:28 Morris Corlew laughs.

02:01:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "How can I possibly earn 139k withoug doing any work."

02:01:32 Evenia Callseah snorts.

02:01:34 You chuckle.

02:01:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:01:38 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

02:01:43 Damien Alexander says, "Holy damn."

02:01:46 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods west.

02:01:50 Morris says to Lily, "Turn in belt points?"

02:01:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nope."

02:02:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I haven't for weeks."

02:02:06 Evenia says to Eli, "Did you end up top negative contributor?"

02:02:09 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It was negative."

02:02:10 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Incidentally, it's important to make sure that the belt points are not operating, at all."

02:02:11 "Participate in any skirmishes?" Morris Corlew shrugs.

02:02:14 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Er, belt stations."

02:02:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow we had just one performer."

02:02:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:02:34 Eli says to Ather, "But what about the workers?"

02:02:37 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Johann Schraft yells, "Conquest."

02:02:37 The AEU did not reach any of its performance goals.

02:02:37 Top Performers: Jacob Shields.
The current Conquest period began 1 minute and 45 seconds ago. The period will end in 3 days, 23 hours, 57 minutes, and 22 seconds.

02:02:43 Ather says to Eli, "What about them?"

02:02:43 Morris Corlew glances at Johann Schraft.

02:02:50 Johann Schraft coughs.

02:02:51 Evenia Callseah laughs at Johann Schraft.

02:02:58 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "They work for us. If we let them work, they're still giving resources to the alliance."

02:03:08 Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "Yep."

02:03:15 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "All that's happening is your points aren't being credited. The alliance is still getting the resources though."

02:03:19 Morris Corlew says, "Just like goin out and collectin artifacts to turn in after."

02:03:32 Morris Corlew says, "Actually, worse."

02:03:45 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Erm."

02:04:02 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "If something's not getting turned in and it's in my ship, then how is the alliance getting it?"

02:04:03 "I thought that'd be obvious!" Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

02:04:16 Morris says to Ather, "Guess not."

02:04:17 Ather says to Eli, "Because you're working towards it, and are oging to turn it in eventually."

02:04:23 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the east.

02:04:23 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:04:24 Sarah Bellamy bebops northeast.

02:04:25 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:04:28 Ather says to Eli, "It's like me doing stuff on teslabucks and accumulating teslabucks."

02:04:30 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Morris Corlew yells, "Sarah!"

02:04:32 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Er, teslaworld."

02:04:35 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the northeast.

02:04:35 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:04:38 Katina Faye beams at Sarah Bellamy.

02:04:39 Sarah Bellamy says, "There you are."

02:04:47 Morris Corlew nods. "Walked right past us."

02:04:49 Morris Corlew grins.

02:04:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves and smiles at Sarah Bellamy.

02:04:51 Sarah Bellamy says, "SOrry."

02:04:54 You wave to Sarah Bellamy.

02:04:54 Damien Alexander waves to Sarah Bellamy.

02:04:57 Morris says to Sarah, "Nothin to be sorry bout."

02:04:57 Sarah Bellamy waves to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:05:02 Johann Schraft says, "Maybe, but those resources from tesla get turned in when you complete the site."

02:05:03 Sarah Bellamy waves to you.

02:05:09 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Oh right, that too."

02:05:10 Eli says to Ather, "Well I could see the teslabucks thing because you're not phsycially holding onto the stuff."

02:05:18 Evenia Callseah waves and smiles at Sarah Bellamy.

02:05:22 Sarah Bellamy waves to Evenia Callseah.

02:05:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The point is to keep stuff away from the alliance."

02:05:34 Morris Corlew says, "It may not break the literal rules of the strike, but it certainly breaks the spirit."

02:05:38 Ather says to Eli, "Anywya, a strike implies you're not going to do any work. If you still do work though, in the form of gathering up artifacts to turn in later, that's not going on strike."

02:05:38 Johann Schraft says, "At least you still have possession of the artifacts until the strike is over."

02:05:50 Johann says to Eli, "You could give me artifacts, I need the money."

02:05:59 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Did anyone send me mail?"

02:06:01 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ithought the point of a strike was to cut off the oppressors from what they want from you."

02:06:04 Evenia Callseah nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "Share. We're nice people."

02:06:12 "Maybe a key from Tobias?" Morris Corlew shakes his head at Sarah Bellamy.

02:06:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Oh wait, huh? What did someone want?"

02:06:20 Morris says to Eli, "No."

02:06:24 Evenia says to Eli, "All your damn artifacts!"

02:06:25 Sarah says to Morris, "Maybe but I have the key to the ship I told him I was gonna kidnap."

02:06:28 Morris says to Eli, "The point is to stop working and often not let anyone else work either."

02:06:31 Damien Alexander smirks at Evenia Callseah.

02:06:41 Katina Faye says, "Back in a sec."

02:06:46 Katina quietly slips away.

02:06:47 Katina Faye walks east.

02:06:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

02:06:56 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the east.

02:07:00 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

02:07:01 Morris Corlew waves to Nissi Valdaire.

02:07:06 Evenia Callseah waves and grins at Nissi Valdaire.

02:07:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey shrugs. "Nobody had any problem with me building stations and that's more work than artifacting, in my opinion."

02:07:09 Morris Corlew says, "Good. Our voice is here."

02:07:10 Johann Schraft nods to Nissi Valdaire.

02:07:11 Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire.

02:07:13 Nissi Valdaire waves.

02:07:19 Sarah Bellamy grins at Nissi Valdaire.

02:07:25 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "Citizens and security forces, do what you can to stop what is happening here! We cannot let this alliance turn into a dictatorship led by someone who does not seek what is good for everyone! First he wants to remove us from the Accord, which is humanity's last best hope for survival, now he seeks to intimidate our citizenry!"

02:07:29 Morris says to Eli, "That work never gets your alliance anything. Not now, not later."

02:07:38 Morris says to Eli, "Kinda like participatin in a hobby."

02:07:44 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Yes yes you don't like these funky battlesuit missions, we'd likely get fire and bottles and all manner of stuff tossed at us."

02:07:49 Morris says to Eli, "But them artifacts certainly do."

02:08:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What if they are turned into another Alliance or eAOS."

02:08:09 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Not unless they meet our demands and I give them to them, but ok."

02:08:32 Morris says to Lily, "It's still taxed."

02:08:34 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Because someone from the AEU turned them in, they will still share the findings with the AEU."

02:08:41 Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

02:08:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey shrugs. "It's done now, I'm not gonna throw them in the trash."

02:08:51 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "And the AEu will receive a bit of the credits for the find, and the AEu will be the ones crediting you with the points."

02:08:52 Morris says to Eli, "Wait...you have been already?"

02:08:57 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I needed to relax and that's how I relax."

02:09:02 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:09:04 Eli says to Morris, "A long time ago."

02:09:08 Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:09:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Like a week into the strike or something."

02:09:36 Evenia Callseah says, "Screw throwing them in the trash. What's done is done. I mean it's how you relax, like you said."

02:09:39 Evenia Callseah nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:09:57 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Even if you mine at an EAOS mining station, they will still give a portion of the resources that you mine to the AEU."

02:09:59 Morris bites his lip and shrugs. "Y'all make your own choices."

02:10:03 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Don''t let Best turn the pilots against the citizens! We do what we do for the citiznes,  not to oppress them!"

02:10:09 Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

02:10:35 Damien Alexander asks, "So what exactly did this battlesuit mission want ya ta do?"

02:10:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Don't really know."

02:10:45 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "Nobody really knows."

02:10:56 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Probalby just walk around and look scary."

02:10:59 Damien Alexander says, "I thought somebody took one ta see what was up."

02:11:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nope we decided against it."

02:11:10 Morris says to Damien, "Shule was gonna...but not now."

02:11:15 Damien Alexander nods.

02:11:15 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

02:11:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah, because even just getting out there is doing what they want."

02:11:26 Sarah Bellamy nods to you. "Good call I think."

02:11:28 Evenia Callseah says, "Screw that. Those are citizens out there. They don't have...yeah, I'm gonna stop now before I can't."

02:11:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Shuel and I were going to go in without weapons and get them destroyed in protest."

02:11:33 You nod.

02:11:35 Damien Alexander nods to Evenia Callseah.

02:11:50 Ather says in a slightly louder voice but still addressing Damien, "they want us to intimidate the citizens by showing them brute force in the form of battlesuits! Something no civilian pilot with a conscience should ever do."

02:11:53 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Citiznes are very squishy and do not require battlesuits."

02:12:16 Evenia Callseah nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:12:21 Morris Corlew says, "And likely can't blow up your suit neither."

02:12:25 Morris Corlew glances at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:12:47 Damien nods emphatically to Ather. "I thought just the idea was nuts. Bullying, like I said in the lounge earlier."

02:12:59 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Alexander. "Yep."

02:13:06 Evenia Callseah nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "I can't even...barbaric."

02:13:07 Damien Alexander shakes his head. "Disgusting."

02:13:14 Evenia Callseah says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Protest."

02:13:17 Morris Corlew says, "Breakin the arms of citizens, pilots goin out and stunnin 'em...whatever...just ain't a good thing. period."

02:13:17 Evenia Callseah says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Um."

02:13:18 Ather says loudly once more, "yes, bullying is exactly what it is! The president wants to bully the citizens to do things his way, and no other way!"

02:13:26 Morris glances at Lily again.

02:13:26 Damien Alexander says into his indigo metachannel FTL communicator, "C'mon ta New Earth."

02:13:29 Evenia Callseah says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "We're out at another protest."

02:13:50 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Johann Schraft yells, "Support your people, not your president."

02:14:14 Damien Alexander says into his indigo metachannel FTL communicator, "Bullyin' people with battlesuits is what we're protesting."

02:14:15 Johann Schraft says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Using battlesuits on civilians.."

02:14:23 Evenia Callseah says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "The fact that best wants pilots to use battlesuits to make the citizens do what he wants."

02:14:38 Katina Faye walks in from the east.

02:14:53 Damien mutters, "Like ta go up ta him in a battlesuit... see how he likes havin' a needlegun pointed at his face..."

02:14:55 Sarah Bellamy says, "It's the one and only Katina."

02:14:57 Katina Faye takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

02:15:05 Morris Corlew grins at Damien Alexander.

02:15:15 Sarah Bellamy grins at Damien Alexander.

02:15:18 Katina Faye smiles warmly at Sarah.

02:15:36 "Or a nice cuddly envelop?" Evenia Callseah smirks at Damien Alexander.

02:15:56 Damien smirks at Morris and Sarah, and mimes readying a battlesuit gun to fire.

02:16:00 Johann opens his mouth to speak, but thinks better of it and closes it again.

02:16:01 Sarah Bellamy grins.

02:16:06 Damien Alexander grins at Evenia Callseah. "Mmm, yes. Plasma."

02:16:09 Evenia Callseah says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "No. Head 2 west of the landing pad. Outside the security office."

02:16:14 Morris Corlew says, "Nanites."

02:16:19 Morris Corlew wriggles his fingers.

02:16:25 Damien Alexander says, "Warm an' cosy fer all time."

02:16:26 Damien Alexander absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:16:58 Morris Corlew begins leaning against the doorjam of the security office.

02:17:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:17:20 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "Fight for what's right...peacefully! Any citizen or civilian pilot can stage a peaceful protest anywhere to speak out against the current actions of the administration. You all still have a voice! We are still a democracy! The government is subject to the will of the people! Commit no violence, but speak out!"

02:17:34 Katina Faye smiles at Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

02:17:40 Morris Corlew gives Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa a thumbs up!

02:17:44 Sarah Bellamy gives Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa a high five.

02:17:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey programs an unetched steel plaque with some supplied tools. A soft hissing sound fills the room as the instaetch compound begins to work.

02:17:59 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Morris Corlew yells, "Violence ain't the way. Not for the citizens, not for the government!"

02:18:08 The hissing abruptly stops, and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smiles in satisfaction at a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "the Best administration wants to use pilots in battlesuits as part of their so called peacekeeping force. civilian pilots should not be used as police and citizens should not have to live in fear of these heavily armed machines. If you are a pilot, then do not take this step towards a dark future. If you are a citizen then stand up and make your voice heard against this treatment. We must change the path we are headed down before it's too late".

02:18:20 Evenia Callseah begins standing up to her full height, her hard eyes glancing between the security office, and the people around her.

02:18:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers for Rogue Pilot Eli Grey!

02:18:38 Sarah says to Eli, "That's awesome."

02:18:44 You grin at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:18:54 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hmm."

02:18:58 Nicolette Lawrence rolls in from the east.

02:19:03 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey hangs a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "the Best administration wants to use pilots in battlesuits as part of their so called peacekeeping force. civilian pilots should not be used as police and citizens should not have to live in fear of these heavily armed machines. If you are a pilot, then do not take this step towards a dark future. If you are a citizen then stand up and make your voice heard against this treatment. We must change the path we are headed down before it's too late" on the nearest wall. How lovely.

02:19:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Nicolette Lawrence.

02:19:09 Sarah Bellamy cheers for Rogue Pilot Eli Grey!

02:19:11 Morris Corlew gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:19:16 Damien Alexander gives Rogue Pilot Eli Grey a thumbs up!

02:19:19 Damien says to Eli, "Nice."

02:19:20 Evenia Callseah cheers and salutes Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:19:21 Katina Faye applauds at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:19:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

02:19:24 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey picks up Eli Grey's workbench.

02:19:26 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey puts Eli Grey's workbench in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:19:46 Damien Alexander waves to Nicolette Lawrence.

02:19:50 Sarah Bellamy waves to Nicolette Lawrence.

02:19:51 Nicolette Lawrence waves and waves.

02:19:57 Evenia Callseah waves to Nicolette Lawrence.

02:20:15 Evenia says to Nicolette, "Need to be filled in? Someone should fill her in."

02:20:26 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa points at a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "the Best administration wants to use pilots in battlesuits as part of their so called peacekeeping force. civilian pilots should not be used as police and citizens should not have to live in fear of these heavily armed machines. If you are a pilot, then do not take this step towards a dark future. If you are a citizen then stand up and make your voice heard against this treatment. We must change the path we are headed down before it's too late".

02:20:33 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Bam. Filled in."

02:20:35 Damien Alexander says, "Best is terrible. No, wait ya knew that already."

02:20:46 Sarah Bellamy grins.

02:21:07 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Don't let Best turn the Union into a police state! Civilian pilots protect the citizens, not control them!"

02:21:13 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I've seen the headline and between that and Eli's plaque I'm probably up to date, more or less."

02:21:18 Evenia says to Nicolette, "There's a guy that's trying to recruit pilots to...yeah."

02:21:26 Nicolette Lawrence nods.

02:21:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "A Navy guy."

02:21:49 Evenia Callseah says, "It's fuckin' barbaric is what it is."

02:22:14 Damien Alexander nods to Evenia Callseah and nods.

02:22:17 Nicolette Lawrence asks, "I thought Best had this super-high approval rating? Who's he having trouble getting to do what he wants, other than his pilots?"

02:22:21 Damien Alexander says, "That's what I keep sayin'."

02:22:32 "We still do'nt know if they are using weapons." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey shakes his head. "But even if they are spying or something, the suits are still intimidating."

02:22:37 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "Civilian pilots, you have a voice! Don't let the president turn you into an unlawful police force. You are not mindless machines, and neither are the citizens of the Union! Speak up against this horrible new "peacekeeping" taskforce, and speak out against all of the other policies enforced by the president that you don't agree with!"

02:22:42 Damien Alexander says, "The approval rating's probably faked."

02:22:43 Damien Alexander gestures vaguely.

02:22:43 Morris says to Nicolette, "Whoever beheaded that chairman on Hyperion."

02:22:45 Evenia Callseah says, "Damn right they are."

02:22:46 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:22:51 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

02:22:56 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The approval rating is bullshit."

02:23:01 Evenia Callseah absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:23:04 Damien Alexander nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:23:37 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "See, watch this. "seventy percent of pilots think eli is a pretty normal guy""

02:23:43 Sarah Bellamy grins.

02:23:46 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods northeast.

02:23:57 Nicolette says to Eli, "You're not normal."

02:23:57 Patriot Constantine Stone walks in from the east.

02:23:58 Patriot Constantine Stone walks west.

02:24:00 Evenia says to Eli, "That's so wrong, it's 85.374% of pilots."

02:24:04 Nicolette says to Eli, "You're okay, but you're not normal."

02:24:06 Nicolette Lawrence laughs.

02:24:06 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Morris Corlew yells, "Constantine."

02:24:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Nicolette Lawrence.

02:24:16 You wave to Nicolette Lawrence.

02:24:26 Morris Corlew says, "Ah well."

02:24:35 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:24:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Constantine, we're by the security office, inside the spaceport."

02:24:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, oops."

02:24:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "DON'T EXPLOIT OUR PILOTS TO DO YOUR WORK FOR YOU BEST! WE'RE HERE TO DEFEND AND TO PROTECT HUMANITY. WE ARE NOT THE POLICE! BATTLESUITS AREN'T FOR POLICING!"

02:24:48 Patriot Constantine Stone walks in from the west.

02:24:49 Patriot Constantine Stone walks east.

02:24:49 Patriot Constantine Stone walks in from the east.

02:24:50 Patriot Constantine Stone waves.

02:24:56 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't know how I missed you guys."

02:24:56 Evenia Callseah waves to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:24:57 Patriot Constantine Stone blushes.

02:24:59 Patriot Constantine Stone waves.

02:25:01 Sarah Bellamy says, "I did too."

02:25:03 Morris Corlew waves to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:25:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:25:06 Katina stifles a giggle.

02:25:13 You wave to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:25:17 Katina Faye waves to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:25:19 Sarah Bellamy waves to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:25:19 Johann Schraft nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.
Evenia Callseah says, "You just gotta look out for the glow. You can find us that way. It's like the protest beacon."

02:25:24 Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

02:25:26 Morris says to Constantine, "We're so loud and creatin such a ruckus...ya just overlooked us."

02:25:27 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

02:25:27 Morris Corlew grins.

02:25:34 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Stop the madness! We should use battlesuits on real threats, not regular citizens!"

02:25:41 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:25:51 Katina Faye walks northeast.

02:26:07 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Morris Corlew yells, "Battlesuits are for use against enemies. AEU citizens ain't the enemy!"

02:26:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides east.

02:26:17 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "We all can stop this, if we stick together! If we fight for what's right by standing firm, and launching peaceful protests on all AEU holdings! Don't let anyone intimidate you! Don't let anyone force you to do something that you know is so wrong, and using powered armor to threaten the citizens of the union is wrong!"

02:26:36 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Well we need new shirts now. Only I don't know what to call these, Stop Outccord was easy."

02:26:42 Katina Faye walks in from the northeast.

02:26:42 Sarah Bellamy grins.

02:26:46 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Best is trying to patrol your streets with lethal weapons! Demand he be held accountable!"

02:26:46 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:26:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Constantine you might want to remove your spacesuit so you can hear us or er if you don't want to?"

02:26:48 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:26:49 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I thought that one up all by myself."

02:26:51 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

02:26:52 Patriot Constantine Stone removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly into a dark orange flightbag with a white lightning bolt on the side.

02:26:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:26:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the east.

02:26:57 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "What does a battlesuit have to do with someone being killed in their home? Will they have us searching your homes next?"

02:27:01 Patriot Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:27:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I slept in it."

02:27:04 Morris says to Constantine, "Spacesuit?"

02:27:07 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

02:27:09 Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

02:27:12 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

02:27:24 Sarah Bellamy finishes off a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural cherry juice.

02:27:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles at Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:27:34 You chuckle at Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:27:45 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "Soon there will be no privacy for the citizens of the Union, if we let the president persist on his current path. He will silence our voices, he will take away our freedoms one by one!"

02:27:45 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I miss that new pilot action figure."

02:27:46 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods southwest.

02:28:34 "It's okay." Evenia Callseah pats Patriot Constantine Stone on the back. "At least you didn't turn up in your pajamas this time."

02:28:42 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Hey, those are stylin'"

02:28:46 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:28:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:28:51 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

02:28:57 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Every inch we give puts us closer to having an overlord instead of a president! Don't let the government intimdate you with battlesuits!"

02:28:57 Morris Corlew nudges a sanitation drone gently.

02:29:03 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Swamp monsters stand against Best too."

02:29:17 Damien Alexander chuckles.

02:29:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:29:23 Nicolette says to a sanitation drone, "Who are you working for? You should go on strike."

02:29:28 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:29:31 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

02:29:42 Eli says to a sanitation drone, "Don't let them make you shit out that broom one more time."

02:29:44 Damien Alexander pats a sanitation drone lightly.

02:29:46 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods east.

02:29:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:29:49 I don't see that here.

02:29:50 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "Eli is right! We already had one overlord over humanity in the form of Zmnyaz! Are we going to have one for the AEU known as Best? I think not! We can stop this together!"

02:29:51 Damien Alexander laughs.

02:29:53 You chuckle at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:29:53 Evenia Callseah laughs. "Off it goes."

02:29:56 Nissi Valdaire says, "Don't tell him that, he'll collect garbage even faster just to spite you."

02:30:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah..."

02:30:15 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Nissi Valdaire.

02:30:17 Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire.

02:30:22 Evenia Callseah grins at Nissi Valdaire.

02:30:43 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I'm surprised he doesn't have the sanitation drones doing what he's wanting the pilots to do already. They could probably be repurposed."

02:30:53 Damien says to Nicolette, "Don't give him any ideas."

02:30:54 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "The Union is being taken away from it's citizens bit by bit. Asking pilots to police you with battlesuits is the latest step!"

02:30:55 Evenia Callseah shudders. "That's a seriously horrible thought."

02:30:57 Morris Corlew says, "Probably could."

02:31:01 Johann Schraft says, "Better start campaigning for drone rights if he doesn't listen to you."

02:31:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:31:11 Morris Corlew says, "They used to be programmed to uh...well yeah..."

02:31:12 Morris Corlew says, "Ahem."

02:31:20 Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew.

02:31:21 Damien Alexander says, "Yeah."

02:31:34 Morris Corlew says, "That's nightmare images right there."

02:31:35 Katina Faye raises an eyebrow at Morris Corlew.

02:31:36 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Don't let Best institute martial law! Demand that he be stopped!"

02:31:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "I thought they were repurposed enforcer drones?"

02:31:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Thought I read a headline about that."

02:31:49 Nicolette Lawrence nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:31:49 Morris says to Katina, "You uh...wouldn't wanna know..."

02:31:56 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:32:08 Nicolette Lawrence says, "That's another possibility. But at least we can fight those, if he tries that."

02:32:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As far as I recall, I believe these have always been sanitation drones but they used to do some terrible things."

02:32:30 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "That's what I was talkin bout."

02:32:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I don't even want to mention it."

02:32:59 Morris Corlew says, "Which is why I didn't..."

02:33:00 Evenia shakes her head vigorously.

02:33:24 Katina Faye takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

02:33:46 Damien closes his eyes and shakes his head. "I remember..."

02:33:46 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "The man inside wants pilots to patrol the streets in mechanized armor! Is this how the citizens of the Union should be treated?"

02:33:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But anyway at least they keep the trash under control. The tourists around here are prone to just dropping everything especially around the aquarium."

02:34:05 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "When I ran past you guys I saw that citizens are still protesting Outccord by the courthouse."

02:34:07 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "So that's something."

02:34:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Wow that's great!"

02:34:16 Morris Corlew says, "Oh cool."

02:34:21 Katina Faye says, "Sexy."

02:34:22 Johann Schraft exclaims, "Nice!"

02:34:26 Damien Alexander grins.

02:34:35 Evenia Callseah says, "Hell yeah."

02:34:37 Katina Faye takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

02:34:44 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I wonder if we should be riling them up."

02:35:15 Eli says to Constantine, "Wait, they are?"

02:35:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey exclaims, "Nice!"

02:35:25 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, there's like a throng gathered outside."

02:35:25 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I never knew any citizens ever showed up."

02:35:36 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "With signs and everything."

02:35:41 Morris Corlew says, "Cool."

02:35:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll be right back."

02:35:48 Morris Corlew stops leaning against the doorjam of the security office.

02:35:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides west.

02:35:51 Morris Corlew says, "I wanan go see."

02:35:53 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

02:35:55 Katina Faye walks west.

02:35:56 Morris says to Eli, "I'll take a pitcher."

02:35:56 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah I kinda want to too."

02:35:57 Morris Corlew lumbers west.

02:36:29 Eli says to Constantine, "Did you blow up more ships?"

02:36:36 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I meant to ask you the same."

02:36:39 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "The numbers were nuts."

02:36:40 Katina Faye walks in from the west.

02:36:47 Morris Corlew lumbers in from the west.

02:36:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah, I'm not sure how it's even lower than when we blew up those ships."

02:36:57 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I assumed you must have blown something up."

02:36:59 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Unless Vernos blew up all his ships in secrecy."

02:37:01 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Nah, not me."

02:37:03 Morris Corlew says to Constantine, "All I see are the anti-Tandem idiots."

02:37:14 Morris Corlew says, "And the signs we hung up."

02:37:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:37:26 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well damn, that's a shame."

02:37:27 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I saw some groups out there."

02:37:34 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "And kids handing out signs."

02:37:45 Morris says to Constantine, "The ones hangin up them red signs are the anti-Tandem idiots."

02:37:57 Eli nods sadly.

02:38:18 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I thought the kids were hanging the anti outccord signs."

02:38:19 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves in from the east.

02:38:26 Morris Corlew says, "Nope."

02:38:28 Morris Corlew waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:38:30 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Aww."

02:38:30 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'm sure the Kelsey thing has really poured fuel on their fire too."

02:38:34 Evenia Callseah waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:38:39 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins and waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:38:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Allo, I am protestater."

02:38:40 Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "Unfortunately."

02:38:50 Patriot Constantine Stone asks, "What happened with Kelsey?"

02:38:52 Johann says to Pierre-Louis, "You're a prostate?"

02:39:02 Morris says to Constantine, "He's a provisionary member of the Tandem Pact."

02:39:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I have at least one of those."

02:39:05 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "He's a probationary member of the Tandem Pact."

02:39:08 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, right."

02:39:10 Johann Schraft grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:39:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Er, yeah what Morris said."

02:39:20 Evenia Callseah smirks at Johann Schraft.

02:39:27 Johann says to Pierre-Louis, "I'll take your word for it."

02:39:38 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "Be a prostrator."

02:40:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys asks, "You think the nice fellow over there will take me as a peacekeeper?"

02:40:10 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "No."

02:40:14 You wave to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:40:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "NQ suit is perfect for peaceful peacekeeping duty, I assure fine folks of AEU as I drench them in syrup."

02:40:56 Nissi Valdaire grins.

02:40:59 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I actually suggested a peaceful NQ parade earlier."

02:41:00 Morris Corlew says, "Hey."

02:41:01 Evenia Callseah grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:41:03 Morris Corlew says, "That uh."

02:41:03 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Syrup mods only."

02:41:06 Morris Corlew grins.

02:41:35 Ather casually takes a step towards Pierre-Louis and pats him on the back firmly.

02:41:50 Morris says to Ather, "Any harder it'd hurt."

02:41:52 Morris Corlew grins at Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

02:41:58 You chuckle.

02:42:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Yes."

02:42:15 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Don't let Best use weapons on his own people!"

02:42:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys asks, "Which planets is he sending battlesuits on? Juste Hyperion for now?"

02:42:50 Katina Faye takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

02:42:59 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I'm not really sure. The officer is stingy with details, and signing up just to find out wasn't a good idea."

02:43:00 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "We thought."

02:43:16 Nicolette Lawrence says, "He'll be enlisting all the soldier felo from the sanctuary."

02:43:22 Johann Schraft says, "Well, does he want someone in a fringe five with rockets equipped rollign past his headquarters? I would assume he doesn't."

02:43:28 Evenia blinks rapidly at Nicolette.

02:43:42 Evenia says to Johann, "I know I wouldn't."

02:43:43 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "If we knew we could find out,  and abort the mission without alunching it would be one thing, but they seem to like entrapping folks into it."

02:43:45 Constantine says to Johann, "Yeah, probably not."

02:43:47 Morris Corlew nods to Johann Schraft. "Don't think he thought that through too well."

02:44:01 You peer west...

02:44:01 
[New Earth; Spaceport East]
This part of the spaceport has a fresh new look. Numerous pilot services are available from the facilities here, including from the new Unreality Programming office to the south, where a bold green and white banner announces: 'Employment Opportunities! Apply inside!' Next to it, the spaceport's ship store competes with a brand new flashing sign reading: 'Ship Sales! Don't be grounded!' Between them, nearly hidden behind a potted plant is a wide stairway leading downward to a lower level of the spaceport. A small sign near the stairway reads: Aerial Fortresses and Supply. Other areas of interest here are the Fund Center to the northwest, the pawn shop to the north, and the trading center to the northeast.
You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

02:44:11 Katina Faye finishes off a hot cup of espresso.

02:44:20 Katina Faye walks west.

02:44:25 Katina Faye walks in from the west.

02:44:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "There she goes.."

02:44:33 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Off to find a muffin."

02:44:38 Katina Faye says to Eli, "I went to trash my cup."

02:44:38 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

02:45:00 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Katina Faye. "Sorry, I just like poking you about the muffin thing."

02:45:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Very shifty."

02:45:13 Damien Alexander says, "Muffins are awesome."

02:45:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Damien Alexander.

02:45:23 Katina Faye presses her lips together, her eyes dancing with laughter.

02:45:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the west.

02:45:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "They are quite delicious."

02:45:35 Evenia Callseah says, "Starships are better."

02:45:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup they're busy out there."

02:45:57 You ask, "Busy out where?"

02:46:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:46:18 Eli says to Lily, "Isn't it the same ones as before, the Tandem Pat folks?"

02:46:37 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well and there's always that one guy who's hanging up a pro-Garner sign."

02:46:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smirks.

02:46:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I couldn't tell. It was a pretty mixed bunch and more than one group."

02:46:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

02:46:52 Morris Corlew says, "It's the same ones that are generally there."

02:46:58 Morris Corlew says, "With those danged red signs."

02:47:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The plaques are still up too."

02:47:32 Damien Alexander says, "I like starships at least as much as muffins."

02:47:38 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Damien Alexander.

02:47:42 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "If I could fly a muffin, I would."

02:47:47 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But only if it had a lot of failsafes."

02:47:47 Damien Alexander laughs at Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:47:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:47:54 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:47:57 Evenia Callseah says, "Starships and muffins are equal, as long as the muffin is chocolate chip."

02:47:57 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "A Muffin shaped starship would be nice. With a muffin dispenser button."

02:48:06 Damien Alexander exclaims, "Fire the muffin cannons!"

02:48:10 Katina Faye blushes.

02:48:23 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:48:29 Damien Alexander grins.

02:48:35 Eli says to Katina, "Don't worry, I think we've moved into general muffin discussion."

02:49:02 Evenia Callseah says, "No no. What we need is that muffin ship with muffin cannons, but also choco grapeshot cannons. That shit hurts if it hits you in the head."

02:49:02 Damien says to Katina, "What, at least we're not talkin' about putting muffins in boxes."

02:49:08 Evenia Callseah chortles.

02:49:10 Damien Alexander glances around at his surroundings.

02:49:12 Damien Alexander says, "Yet."

02:49:22 Morris Corlew says, "Umm."

02:49:27 Damien Alexander cackles!

02:49:29 Katina softly chews on her lip.

02:49:38 Morris Corlew says, "Any time I've bout a pack fo muffins...they sure came in a box alright."

02:49:40 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

02:49:40 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Citizens should not be policed by battlesuits! Cvilian pilots shout not be turned into Bet's personal brute squad! Put an end to it now!"

02:49:49 Evenia Callseah giggles.

02:49:52 Damien giggles helplessly.

02:49:57 Evenia says to Morris, "Were they nice and snug in the box?"

02:50:04 Morris says to Evenia, "Yep."

02:50:05 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Best's plans are the worst! Don't let him turn weapons on civilians!"

02:50:10 Damien Alexander says, "C'mon, now, this is supposed ta be a serious protest here."

02:50:14 Eli shakes his head , grinning.

02:50:31 "You fuckin' started it!" Evenia Callseah pokes Damien Alexander in the ribs!

02:50:44 Eli says to Morris, "Oh uh, I might need some more booze."

02:50:52 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

02:50:53 Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:51:04 Morris says to Eli, "I'll send ya a box."

02:51:06 Damien Alexander laughs at Evenia Callseah.

02:51:14 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Last night, it was just Dakhal, Eve and I on comms and we all kinda got tore up on jar booze."

02:51:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

02:51:26 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:51:31 Evenia Callseah says, "And played horrible people."

02:51:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

02:51:51 Nicolette Lawrence says, "That must've gotten boring pretty quickly."

02:52:01 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "Yeah it wasn't the best game."

02:52:13 Evenia Callseah says, "Nah. It was better than sitting down talking about depressing shit and being depressed."

02:52:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

02:52:58 Eli says to Morris, "That stuff is amazing by the way. Not sure how you get it so strong but so smooth."

02:53:15 Evenia covers a giggle.

02:53:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "All the white lightning, flying through the air."

02:53:18 Morris says to Eli, "Umm...does 'runs in the family' work for ya?"

02:53:27 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs at Morris Corlew.

02:53:28 Evenia giggles helplessly.

02:54:47 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Don't let Best put pilots in battlesuits to patrol your streets like sentinels! Pilots belong in space, protecting our worlds, not policing our towns!"

02:54:55 Nicolette Lawrence cheers.

02:55:23 You cheer for Rogue Pilot Eli Grey!

02:56:24 Evenia Callseah grins at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:56:38 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Woo."

02:58:29 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Citizens shouldn't have to fear a heavily armed warrior walking their streets! Stop the oppression now!"

02:59:49 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Battlesuits protect us from alien threats! Don't let the adminstration turn them into mobile oppression fortresses!"

03:00:10 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Also, stop Outccord!"

03:00:13 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.

03:00:17 Patriot Constantine Stone cheers.

03:00:20 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Yes do stop that."

03:00:20 Katina Faye grins.

03:00:29 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Let me just attach an oppression fortress to my mule."

03:00:36 "Yes." Evenia Callseah nods. "That as well. While we're protesting, let's make that clear too."

03:00:39 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smirks at Patriot Constantine Stone.

03:01:11 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Stop Outccord. Stop battlesuits. Just stop it. Stop it all."

03:01:16 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Best is undermining the Accord and using weapons to patrol the streets! Is this the president you want?"

03:01:33 Nicolette Lawrence stomps on the ground!

03:01:36 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Citizens of the Union, you already don't like civilian pilots, do you really want us patrolling your streets in mechanized armor?"

03:02:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hmm.. Although I bet those rock throwing guys would have thought twice if we were in battlesuits."

03:02:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:02:26 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Morris Corlew yells, "Today it's other citizens. Tomorrow it's you. Stop it before it's too late! There's no need for marial law! Band together and protest peacefully! Tell your government you don't want armored patrols in your streets and want to remain in the Accord!"

03:02:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Also, rocks would have bounced off with a comical tink sound."

03:02:44 You chuckle at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

03:02:44 "Well yeah." Evenia Callseah nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "But they'd also have run like bitches, totally destroying their apparent tough guy image."

03:02:57 Morris Corlew says, "They still did dthat."

03:02:59 Morris Corlew says, "Err."

03:03:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah i'll match their rocks with a load of plasma anyday."

03:03:01 Morris Corlew says, "They still did that."

03:03:16 Morris Corlew says, "Look...they ran from an arm stunner."

03:03:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "70k from investments! Yay, I can still eatgasp "I got."

03:03:20 Evenia Callseah chuckles. "Actually yeah. That ting sound would have been amusing."

03:03:27 Morris Corlew glances at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

03:03:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey looks at Morris Corlew and shrugs. "Nothing I can do about that."

03:04:01 Morris says to Eli, "No....not that...just the end got kinda jumbled..."

03:04:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Erm."

03:04:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.

03:04:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah, sorry."

03:04:40 Evenia Callseah nods. "Talk slower, silly thing."

03:04:40 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Don't let Best use war machines to police your neighborhoods! Stand with us!"

03:04:42 Evenia Callseah pats Rogue Pilot Eli Grey on the back.

03:04:54 Eli says to Evenia, "Quiet you."

03:04:56 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

03:05:22 Evenia Callseah glances at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "Hmmm...nope."

03:05:27 Sarah looks around.

03:05:43 Eli says to Evenia, "You're old."

03:05:54 Damien Alexander smirks and arches an eyebrow.

03:05:58 Evenia says to Eli, "Only a half month older than you. Shut it."

03:06:16 Morris says to Eli, "Birthday comin up?"

03:06:26 Nicolette Lawrence rolls east.

03:06:27 Nicolette Lawrence rolls in from the east.

03:06:52 Evenia says loudly. "Yes, eli turns 30 the day before the day the trip was supposed to leave."

03:07:04 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Best wants to use the pilots to police you! We can't let the administration turn the Union into a police state with heavy weapons platforms stalking the streets!"

03:07:10 You say, "Glad nobody knows when my birthday is. Well, only one, but that's ok."

03:07:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Morris Corlew.

03:07:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Eww 30 I have one more 20 then oooo 30!"

03:07:37 Johann Schraft says, "Thirty is great. I highly recommend it. It beats the alternative."

03:07:39 "I'm still on my very first 20." Morris Corlew laughs. "All y'all old folks."

03:07:43 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins and nods to Johann Schraft.

03:07:48 Sarah Bellamy grins.

03:07:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Johann Schraft.

03:07:55 You grin.

03:07:56 Sarah Bellamy says, "I'm old. Compared to Morris."

03:07:58 Evenia Callseah says, "I wanna go back to 29. It was only half a month ago."

03:07:59 Morris Corlew laughs.

03:08:13 Morris Corlew says, "I'm happy with 20. Beats stayin at 19 forever."

03:08:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

03:08:36 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Just think, one more year and you can drink."

03:08:36 Johann Schraft says, "I don't think you could pay me enough to go back to twenty."

03:08:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smirks.

03:08:42 You chuckle.

03:08:46 Morris says to Eli, "I drink now."

03:08:49 Evenia Callseah says, "Nah...not 20."

03:09:01 Eli says to Morris, "Ssssh, we're right outside the security office man, you wanna get busted?"

03:09:06 Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

03:09:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:09:09 You laugh.

03:09:09 Morris says to Eli, "It's legal."

03:09:12 Sarah Bellamy grins.

03:09:13 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh."

03:09:19 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well in that case nevermind."

03:09:23 Morris Corlew laughs.

03:09:24 Evenia Callseah laughs. "Eli's bubble just went pop."

03:09:26 Sarah Bellamy chuckles.

03:09:29 Morris says to Eli, "This ain't the 21st century ya know."

03:10:08 Johann Schraft says, "Yep. If you're old enough to get shot at, you're old enough to celebrate they missed afterwords."

03:10:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

03:10:14 You grin.

03:10:16 Morris Corlew gives Johann Schraft a high five.

03:10:19 Evenia Callseah cheers for Johann Schraft! "Well said."

03:10:27 Sarah Bellamy grins at Johann Schraft.

03:10:30 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Demand an end to Best's oppression! Don't let him use battlesuits to patrol the streets!"

03:10:46 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:10:48 Morris Corlew lumbers northeast.

03:10:59 Morris Corlew lumbers in from the northeast.

03:11:04 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Stop the oppression before it's too late! Pilots in battlesuits is Best's latest way of controling you with fear!"

03:11:18 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Hellos."

03:11:38 Katina Faye walks east.

03:11:40 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Protestin."

03:11:48 Katina Faye walks in from the east.

03:11:53 You hear Katina Faye's cinnamon brown touch einrophone ringing.

03:11:54 Katina Faye walks east.

03:12:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Oppressing is bad."

03:12:19 Katina Faye walks in from the east.

03:12:24 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey begins standing near the entrance to the security center.

03:12:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

03:12:45 Katina Faye speaks into her cinnamon brown touch einrophone:

03:12:45 Katina Faye says, "New earth right past the bridge."

03:12:56 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Oppressing is depressing! No battlesuits in our streets!"

03:13:02 Patriot Constantine Stone cheers.

03:13:04 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "We're over here protestin now."

03:13:07 Katina Faye speaks into her cinnamon brown touch einrophone:

03:13:07 Katina Faye asks, "Join us?"

03:13:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

03:13:24 Katina Faye speaks into her cinnamon brown touch einrophone:

03:13:24 Katina Faye says, "Okie dokie."

03:13:29 Eli says to Katina, "You have to say it in a hypnotic,  eerie tone."

03:13:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "OUTCCORD MUST STOP! SMAAAAAASH IT RIGHT NOW!"

03:13:36 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Just the other side of the bridge. Can't miss us."

03:13:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:13:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

03:13:45 Katina Faye places a cinnamon brown touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

03:13:46 Katina Faye says, "Pretend I said that in a hipnotic something tone."

03:13:47 Nicolette Lawrence says, "People have misse4d us."

03:13:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

03:13:54 Damien Goss steps in from the east.

03:13:54 Nicolette Lawrence says, "So it's possible."

03:14:00 Sarah Bellamy grins.

03:14:01 Sarah Bellamy says, "Yep."

03:14:03 Tanny Hill swaggers in from the east.

03:14:03 Souleater the little striped orange CatBot trots happily in after Tanny Hill with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:14:04 Morris Corlew says to Nicolette, "Goss didn't. Tanny won't."

03:14:09 Morris Corlew says to Nicolette, "See?"

03:14:10 Tanny Hill asks, "What?"

03:14:16 You wave to Tanny Hill.

03:14:16 Tanny Hill glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

03:14:22 Morris Corlew says to Tanny, "She said you might miss us."

03:14:23 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "You okay?"

03:14:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "OUTCCORD IS A FAILURE! WELL SO IS BEST!"

03:14:35 Damien Goss grins at Katina Faye.

03:14:36 Nicolette Lawrence rolls northeast.

03:14:46 Katina gasp and jumps in surprise.

03:14:48 Katina Faye says, "Oh."

03:14:49 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Best wants to use fear to silence you! Stand with us! Don't let him get away with using lethal weapons to police his people!"

03:14:51 You yell, "Stop Outccord and stop battle suits in the streets!"

03:14:53 Nicolette Lawrence rolls in from the northeast.

03:14:54 Morris Corlew says, "Guy told me to scram. Wasn't exactly rude bout it...but he wasn't nice either."

03:15:02 Tanny Hill says, "So I assume we're protesting... yeah."

03:15:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

03:15:09 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Well I guess I told him."

03:15:09 You nod to Tanny Hill.

03:15:10 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "the Best administration wants to use pilots in battlesuits as part of their so called peacekeeping force. civilian pilots should not be used as police and citizens should not have to live in fear of these heavily armed machines. If you are a pilot, then do not take this step towards a dark future. If you are a citizen then stand up and make your voice heard against this treatment. We must change the path we are headed down before it's too late".

03:15:13 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "That not nice guy."

03:15:25 Sarah Bellamy glides northeast.

03:15:25 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:15:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:15:33 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Gonna have to feed my kids folks. Be back in a bit."

03:15:36 Sarah Bellamy glides in from the northeast.

03:15:36 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:15:37 Sarah Bellamy nods.

03:15:39 Goss says to Katina, "Sorry, I guess it wasn't a very funny joke."

03:15:48 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Johann Schraft yells, "The only suits on the streets that aren't legal but should be are birthday suits, not battlesuits."

03:15:53 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys applauds sedately.

03:15:55 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

03:15:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers for Johann Schraft!

03:15:57 You laugh.

03:15:57 Evenia Callseah applauds at Johann Schraft.

03:15:58 Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

03:15:59 Katina laughs quietly and shrugs.

03:16:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:16:01 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:16:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I am gonna go apply for peacekeepership."

03:16:04 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves northeast.

03:16:09 Tanny Hill asks, "Have we confirmed exactly what they want us to do?"

03:16:13 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves in from the northeast.

03:16:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Wow. Apparently I'm now a top conquest performer. Okay then?"

03:16:18 Morris says to Tanny, "Not us. Just AEU pilots."

03:16:22 Tanny Hill says, "I know."

03:16:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "He called me a lanker. I am unsure what lanker is."

03:16:32 Morris Corlew says, "Um."

03:16:34 Tanny Hill says, "I'm trying to be all unified and shit."

03:16:37 Sarah Bellamy says, "Wow. He didn't call me anything."

03:16:38 Patriot Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

03:16:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't sweat it. You probably just turned in a core or something."

03:16:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah roam the streets in battlesuits as they throw flaming coctails and bottles and bricks and who knows what."

03:16:54 Tanny Hill says, "Huh."

03:16:59 Tanny Hill says, "Well then."

03:17:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Huh. I did turn in two earlier today, as it happens."

03:17:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I sure don't want that shit touching my battlesuits."

03:17:11 Katina says to Morris, "May I have aplaq?"

03:17:13 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "He also said he did not deal with traitors. I think there is a link there."

03:17:21 Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:17:22 Tanny Hill asks, "Can we offer our battle suits to the brick throwers?"

03:17:29 Morris says to Lily, "That 'shit' won't hurt your battlesuit as much as your battlesuit'd hurt the brickthrowers."

03:17:29 Tanny Hill says, "Wait no."

03:17:30 Sarah Bellamy says, "He just told me to move along and that he was only authorized to deal with AEU pilots."

03:17:36 Tanny Hill says, "Bar idea."

03:17:41 Tanny Hill says, "Bad."

03:17:48 Morris says to Katina, "I ain't got none."

03:18:02 Morris says to Katina, "Eli made that one. I'd have to make all the pieces...would take me awhile."

03:18:06 Katina Faye asks, "Could someone make a me a plaq if it's not too much?"

03:18:06 Lily says to Pierre-Louis, "Too bad how sad."

03:18:15 Tanny Hill asks, "Have we as civilian pilots openly condemned the murders and stabbings yet?"

03:18:15 Johann Schraft says, "Raiatea give workbench."

03:18:16 Raiatea the arachnoid security robot says in a synthesized voice, "Order confirmed."

03:18:16 Raiatea the arachnoid security robot removes Johann Schraft's workbench from a compartment and gives it to Johann Schraft.

03:18:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "He is a traitor to us!"

03:18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Lost a turret in the fight though. So I had to buy a full turret repair at new earth. Wasn't too pricy though. I need to eventually get more done to get an asteroid hauler so I can make more cash. I like cash. It's good. Helps me get things I need to survive."

03:18:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I do dislike random beheadings."

03:18:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squints.

03:18:46 Tanny Hill says, "I really don't want to get lumped in with those assholes."

03:18:48 Johann Schraft puts down Johann Schraft's workbench.

03:18:52 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "Better if they're less randomized?"

03:18:57 Damien Goss nods.

03:19:06 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I tried talking to him, got told to move along. So I suggested an activity he might engage in with himself."

03:19:07 Johann Schraft stands before Johann Schraft's workbench and gathers various supplies, then skillfully assembles them into an unetched transparisteel plaque.

03:19:10 Patriot Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

03:19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We're out protesting the latest whatever the hell if you want to come join us."

03:19:15 Patriot Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

03:19:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just west of the bridge."

03:19:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles at Nicolette Lawrence.

03:19:17 Morris Corlew chuckles at Nicolette Lawrence.

03:19:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:19:27 Katina Faye giggles at Nicolette Lawrence.

03:19:31 Damien Goss says, "You should never just randomly distribute violence. It should always be well targetted."

03:19:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Like sit on it and rotate?"

03:19:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'll be there in 10 seconds. Maybe 30 at the max."

03:19:37 Johann Schraft stands before Johann Schraft's workbench and gathers various supplies, then skillfully assembles them into an unetched transparisteel plaque.

03:19:40 Evenia Callseah laughs.

03:19:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:19:41 Nicolette Lawrence laughs.

03:19:47 Patriot Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

03:19:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries, we'll be here a while."

03:19:50 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Well, yes, but there has to be better ways than removing heads."

03:19:53 Damien Goss nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

03:20:00 Morris Corlew says, "Absolutely."

03:20:03 Jacob Shields marches in from the east.

03:20:06 Morris Corlew waves to Jacob Shields.

03:20:10 Evenia Callseah cheers for Jacob Shields!

03:20:10 Johann Schraft nods to Jacob Shields.

03:20:10 Lily nods sadly in Pierre's direction.

03:20:16 Damien Goss says, "Of course the security guards would shoot you just as dead if you just tried to kick Best in the balls."

03:20:17 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Best wants to use the pilot corps to oppress you! Show him that you won't stand for his bullshit!"

03:20:17 You wave to Jacob Shields.

03:20:18 Johann Schraft removes an unetched transparisteel plaque from Johann Schraft's workbench.

03:20:20 Damien Goss shrugs.

03:20:22 Johann Schraft removes an unetched transparisteel plaque from Johann Schraft's workbench.

03:20:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh but I'd like to..."

03:20:28 Johann Schraft asks, "Who wanted a plaque?"

03:20:32 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "Citizens and civilian pilots, speak up now before it's too late! Do your part to stop the president's new "taskforce" from intimidating our civilian population into submition!"

03:20:33 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Katina Faye.

03:20:34 Katina says to Johann, "I didd."

03:20:41 Johann Schraft gives an unetched transparisteel plaque to Katina Faye.

03:20:41 Jacob Shields nods.

03:20:46 Katina says to Johann, "Thank you sir."

03:20:49 Johann Schraft picks up Johann Schraft's workbench.

03:20:53 Johann Schraft gives Johann Schraft's workbench to Raiatea the arachnoid security robot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:20:56 Johann Schraft says, "No problem."

03:20:58 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Either way, this whole traitor thing brought up by navy person makes me curious how close they are to other nice navy person admiral Janus by now."

03:20:58 Damien Goss says, "I think I have a good slogan, if you want me to etch that one Johann."

03:21:11 Johann says to Goss, "Birthday suits, not battlesuits?"

03:21:15 Evenia Callseah laughs.

03:21:15 Johann Schraft gives an unetched transparisteel plaque to Damien Goss.

03:21:17 Damien Goss shakes his head.

03:21:17 You grin.

03:21:18 Tanny Hill says, "Hey so."

03:21:33 Lily looks at Pierre and says Hmm well I hope I find her and if I do ...

03:21:35 Evenia Callseah says, "But that might scare them in a whole different way."

03:21:42 Morris Corlew says, "I think Kennedy's the only one mission."

03:21:43 Morris Corlew says, "Err."

03:21:44 Tanny Hill asks, "Has the League considered offering asylum to Hyperion?"

03:21:45 Morris Corlew says, "Missin."

03:22:01 Damien Goss says, "If you feel underfoot, blame Best. He's got multi-ton powered armor trying to step on you."

03:22:07 Jacob Shields says, "Whatever best is doing is not something I can get behind. I'm all for helping to maintain peace, but not if it's to help our president."

03:22:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Deploy tugs to pull Hyperion near different star."

03:22:10 Damien Goss says, "Or step on your rights."

03:22:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:22:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh a use I have for Annie."

03:22:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:22:34 Tanny Hill says, "Or the people of Hyperion."

03:22:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "That is a lot of people."

03:22:44 Damien Goss says, "If you feel underfoot, blame Best. He's got multi-ton powered armor trying to step on you and your rights."

03:22:47 Damien Goss nods.

03:22:51 Damien Goss says, "There we go that's better."

03:23:06 Tanny Hill says, "I know it's a lot of people, but if civil war breaks out."

03:23:28 Jacob glares coldly at the entrance to the security center and flexes his biceps.

03:23:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Jacob Shields.

03:23:47 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:23:52 Morris Corlew pats a sanitation drone lightly.

03:23:53 Jacob Shields says, "They want us to do their dirty work for them? Fuck that bullshit."

03:24:27 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "First Outccord and now martial law? Who is Best working for? Demand accountability!"

03:24:29 Damien Goss says, "It's also a devious ploy to break your strike by getting you to work in your armor to dissuade people."

03:24:45 Lily says to Jacob, "Yes yes they do and waste our battlesuits on their dirty work."

03:24:47 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods southwest.

03:24:48 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.

03:24:57 Damien Goss says, "Because striking isn't just about making profit, it's stopping all work, period."

03:25:00 Tanny Hill asks, "Also, why did we choose this spot?"

03:25:09 Nicolette Lawrence sighs.

03:25:10 Morris Corlew gives Damien Goss a thumbs up!

03:25:13 Sarah Bellamy asks, "Because it's in front of the security office?"

03:25:15 Lily points to the security office.

03:25:16 Damien Goss says, "The security center is where the pilots go to join the task force."

03:25:21 Jacob Shields nods.

03:25:22 Damien Goss says, "So, blockade."

03:25:47 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:25:56 Tanny Hill says, "Aha."

03:25:57 Lily says to Tanny, "Look at that pompous-looking dude in there."

03:26:09 Johann says to a sanitation drone, "Clean up your government, Don't let best program you the way he wants."

03:26:15 You grin.

03:26:16 Tanny Hill says, "Gotcha."

03:26:17 Evenia Callseah pats a sanitation drone lightly.

03:26:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:26:29 Morris Corlew yawns.

03:26:47 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods southeast.

03:27:04 Katina Faye programs an unetched transparisteel plaque with some supplied tools. A soft hissing sound fills the room as the instaetch compound begins to work.

03:27:06 Jacob Shields begins standing in front of the door to the security center with a cold gleam in his eyes, his fists clenched and his back ramrod straight.

03:27:07 Katina Faye asks, "Is this okay?"

03:27:14 The hissing abruptly stops, and Katina Faye smiles in satisfaction at a transparisteel plaque engraved with the phrase "We should defend humanity, and not tear it asunder with strife. Let us protect each other, let us unite! Stop Outccord, do what is right! Violence is not the answer, unity is where the strength lies.".

03:27:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "He said I was a traitor, I do not know if I will be able to fix damage to my psychologicalness."

03:27:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Jacob Shields.

03:27:33 Jacob Shields nods.

03:27:34 Sarah Bellamy grins at Katina Faye.

03:27:37 Sarah Bellamy beams at Jacob Shields.

03:27:38 Jacob Shields says, "I like that."

03:27:39 Morris Corlew laughs at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

03:27:47 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:27:49 Tanny Hill asks, "But okay, let's say that shit goes completely south and Hyperion descends into civil war. What do we do from there?"

03:27:52 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

03:28:13 Katina Faye considers a transparisteel plaque engraved with the phrase "We should defend humanity, and not tear it asunder with strife. Let us protect each other, let us unite! Stop Outccord, do what is right! Violence is not the answer, unity is where the strength lies." thoughtfully.

03:28:30 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Support the revolutionaries and overthrow Best."

03:28:39 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I mean, maybe."

03:28:45 Katina Faye says, "If only."

03:28:47 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.

03:28:55 Johann Schraft says, "Getting outside groups involved in a civil war will not end well."

03:29:00 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Agreed."

03:29:07 Tanny says to Constantine, "What if those revolutionaries are murdering people?"

03:29:28 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "It seems like they definitely already have. Hopefully they don't all stand for that."

03:29:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah they could be so I'm not into any sort of violent factions whatsoever."

03:29:32 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But that's something we'd have to find out."

03:29:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I will frown heavily."

03:29:37 Jacob Shields says, "The only option I can see us having to work with if that ever happens, is to help the people there in whatever way we can, but not to give best more power. We should do so of our own free will. It is not in my nature to allow others to come to harm where I might prevent it with the help of my brothers and sisters in arms."

03:29:47 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:29:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Jacob Shields.

03:29:55 Morris Corlew says, "Folks generally die in wars. Civil wars pit brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor."

03:30:02 Katina Faye hangs a transparisteel plaque engraved with the phrase "We should defend humanity, and not tear it asunder with strife. Let us protect each other, let us unite! Stop Outccord, do what is right! Violence is not the answer, unity is where the strength lies." on the nearest wall. How lovely.

03:30:07 Patriot Constantine Stone nods to Morris Corlew.

03:30:08 Johann says to Tanny, "The best I think we would be able to do is to try to keep it contained."

03:30:18 Jacob Shields nods.

03:30:30 Jacob Shields says, "Even then we'd have our work cut out for us, I'm afraid."

03:30:30 Tanny Hill nods to Johann Schraft.

03:30:35 Johann says to Tanny, "And again, that's probably not much that we can do as civilians. That's a navy issue."

03:30:40 Lily says to Pierre-Louis, "Naa just eat lots of beans!"

03:30:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:30:47 Morris Corlew says, "But patrollin the streets in battlesuits just can't be the answer."

03:30:47 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods southwest.

03:30:51 Johann Schraft shakes his head.

03:31:01 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I think that will only step up the violence."

03:31:10 Morris Corlew nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.

03:31:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah it never will besides that is not what they are designed for."

03:31:43 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I think Eli should broadcast about this."

03:31:47 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:31:48 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "The task force, I mean."

03:31:58 Morris says to Constantine, "He's been plannin on it."

03:31:59 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "People on our other worlds won't be happy about it."

03:32:00 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

03:32:01 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

03:32:05 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "I will, yeah."

03:32:09 Jacob Shields says, "I agree. Civilians patrolling just doesn't look right in my book. If anyone should be patrolling the streets, it's those who have served or those who are serving now."

03:32:18 Tanny Hill says, "I personally want to press the League to have someplace AEU citizens can flee to."

03:32:36 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Better yet, the Accord."

03:32:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Patriot Constantine Stone.

03:32:42 Morris Corlew nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.

03:32:43 Jacob Shields nods.

03:32:43 Sarah Bellamy nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.

03:32:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah when I in the academy they never taught us anything about law enforcement."

03:32:47 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods east.

03:32:51 Jacob Shields says, "Of course not."

03:33:01 Jacob Shields says, "If they had, things would be different."

03:33:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The battlesuits I think were used against people once. But that was like, terrorists who were full occupying a spaceport or something."

03:33:27 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:33:28 Tanny Hill says, "Accord could help provide asylum, yeah."

03:33:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I don't know too much, about that."

03:33:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well no I probably wouldn't have chosen to be a pilot! Law Enforcement is not what I wanted to do for a career!"

03:33:37 Katina Faye looks at Jacob Shields thoughtfully.

03:33:40 Jacob Shields nods.

03:33:47 Johann Schraft says, "Politics neither, but we seem to be doing a lot of that."

03:33:47 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:33:51 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "Yeah, none of us signed up to be some vigilante-esque taskforce."

03:33:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Johann Schraft.

03:33:52 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

03:33:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

03:33:57 Sarah chuckles and nods at Johann.

03:33:58 Jacob Shields says, "I honestly hate politics."

03:34:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I dislike politics."

03:34:13 Sarah Bellamy says, "I abhor it."

03:34:20 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:34:21 Johann Schraft says, "Poli means many, ticks are blood sucking insects."

03:34:26 Sarah Bellamy nods.

03:34:27 Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

03:34:27 Jacob Shields says, "Exactly."

03:34:32 Katina Faye grins at Johann Schraft.

03:34:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods and laughs.

03:34:38 "It confuses me somtimes." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smirks. "I think I'm too innocent for it."

03:34:42 Jacob Shields asks, "So with that being said, best could be a tick, correct?"

03:34:47 Jacob Shields giggles.

03:34:47 Sarah Bellamy nods.

03:34:47 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.

03:34:58 Jacob Shields says, "Aha. That explains why I don't like him."

03:34:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

03:35:00 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Though, I don't think of myself as necessarily innocent, I've been told that I am."

03:35:44 Morris Corlew looks at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey thoughtfully.

03:35:47 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:35:55 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I think it's your blue coloration."

03:35:58 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "If you were red..."

03:36:02 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "People might think differently."

03:36:22 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:36:25 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

03:36:31 Tanny Hill says, "I have a love hate relationship with politics myself."

03:36:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

03:36:43 Jacob glances at the door to the security center. Upon seeing the officer inside, he glares icily and his right hand twitches slightly.

03:36:45 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Replicator nests, bari, IFs weapons platforms, armored thralls, AEU citizens. One of these things doesn't belong!"

03:36:47 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods west.

03:36:56 Johann says to Eli, "Yeah, now people just think you're depressed. That's why they keep asking you why you're so blue."

03:37:01 Damien Goss asks, "Replicator nests?"

03:37:03 Evenia Callseah groans.

03:37:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Damien Goss.

03:37:11 Morris Corlew says, "Rats."

03:37:11 Eli says to Goss, "RATS."

03:37:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:37:24 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "But I didn't want people thinking Imeant rodents."

03:37:25 Damien Goss says, "No. I was guessing which one didn't belong. Nevermind."

03:37:27 Johann Schraft says, "And not the Jason variety."

03:37:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

03:37:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh I get it."

03:37:40 Jacob Shields snickers.

03:37:59 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "It was AEU citizens! In case it wasn't clear! Do'nt use battlesuits on citizens!"

03:38:06 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

03:38:40 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Citiznes are pretty ok, using battlesuits on them is not ok!"

03:38:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

03:38:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Yeah I wouldn't like to see what they could do to someone who isn't similarly clad so do they want us to go out there and murder people?"

03:39:00 Morris Corlew says, "Not all citizens are pretty. But all citizens are ok."

03:39:02 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

03:39:12 Sarah Bellamy chuckles at Morris Corlew.

03:39:21 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Jacob Shields yells, "It is not we who should be patrolling the streets! Leave that to the men and women who have seen the true face of war!"

03:39:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives Jacob Shields a high five.

03:39:34 Morris Corlew says, "Less ya go after 'em in a battlesuit, then they won't be pretty or ok."

03:39:35 Sarah Bellamy grins at Jacob Shields.

03:39:38 Damien Goss exclaims, "Don't let Best step on your rights with a battlesuit. The point will definately leave you a little flat!"

03:40:04 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "No doubt. I don't want ot think of what a gravitic weapon would do to a human being."

03:40:10 Damien Goss says, "Shred."

03:40:12 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Johann Schraft yells, "Best is trying to put you in chainguns."

03:40:13 Morris Corlew nods.

03:40:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:40:34 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "I do wonder what that scanner is actually scanning for though."

03:40:39 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident yells, "OH GODS CHAINGUNS!"

03:40:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:40:45 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "I mean, it can't detect dissidents, right?"

03:40:50 Jacob Shields says, "Only the dead have seen the end of war. It is a poison, nay, something far worse than that."

03:40:54 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I assume it's some kind of listening device."

03:40:55 Morris says to Eli, "Takes one to know one?"

03:41:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey looks at Patriot Constantine Stone thoughtfully.

03:41:17 Jacob Shields gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:41:32 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Or, maybe you're right."

03:41:34 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "More darkley."

03:41:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'm pretty sure it's not a murderer detector."

03:41:36 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Darkly."

03:41:37 Patriot Constantine Stone coughs.

03:41:51 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Maybe it's a device Best just loads the identities of whoever he wants into."

03:41:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Patriot Constantine Stone. "Yeah."

03:42:09 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It coul djust pop up with a designated target."

03:42:13 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

03:42:15 Jacob Shields says, "By our very nature, we humans cannot have peace between ourselves. And yet, this is what we strive for. Eventually, unless something else happens, we will tear ourselves to bits."

03:42:22 Eli says to Constantine, "But I think you may be right though."

03:42:33 Jacob Shields says, "It's a scary thought if you ask me."

03:42:56 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "Everyone remember, this is not the only protest we have to hold, and is surely not the only protest that we will be holding in the near future! We must do our best to stop Outccord, and to stop the opression of Union citizens. We will hold more protests, and you, the citizenry and other civilian pilots should hold more protests as well. To a better tomorrow! To a better future!"

03:43:17 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "For the Union!"

03:43:21 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Jacob Shields yells, "To a better today!"

03:43:31 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Right, folks. I must dash off to bed, alas."

03:43:37 Patriot Constantine Stone waves to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:43:38 You wave to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:43:39 Katina says to Ather, "Goodnight, Ather."

03:43:43 Sarah Bellamy waves to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:43:46 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Good night!"

03:43:46 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Best wants to leave policing our streets to civilian pilots. Don't leave the poresting up to us too!"

03:43:48 Damien Goss says, "Rest well."

03:43:50 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident yells, "YES TAKE TO THE STREETS ALL OF YOU1 SOP OUTCCORD AND STOP BEST'S OPPRESSION."

03:43:53 Jacob Shields nods.

03:43:54 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Er.. protesting."

03:43:56 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Hold the liiiine! For as long as you can. Don't have to do a multi-day thing though."

03:43:56 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

03:44:12 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa waves frantically!

03:44:15 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa strides east.

03:44:25 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah Imean, I'm not sure I can stand here for days again."

03:44:27 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

03:44:31 Sarah Bellamy chuckles.

03:44:37 Jacob Shields says, "Neither could I."

03:44:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Besides, there's other things that probably should be done."

03:44:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Probably less chance to get beat up by random person in spaceport. Is a big plus for the me."

03:44:48 Jacob Shields nods.

03:44:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

03:44:51 Tanny Hill sits down.

03:44:59 Johann says to Pierre-Louis, "Where are ham and eggs?"

03:44:59 Jacob Shields says, "I'd like to exist for a little longer myself."

03:45:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well just bring a chair!"

03:45:04 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "If someone tried to fuck with you right now, they'd be in big trouble."

03:45:11 Eli looks around at the gathered crowd.

03:45:13 Damien Goss says, "Don't' worry Pierre. If they try to attack you, you can always jump under the bridge."

03:45:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or a floor cusion but I dunno, a bot might steal it."

03:45:50 Jacob Shields says, "They can get under the bridge too, I think."

03:46:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hmm I did some sifting down here a long time ago and don't remember but I wouldn't be surprised."

03:46:33 Jacob Shields glances around at his surroundings.

03:46:36 Jacob Shields nods.

03:46:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "There's condoms in there. Free ones."

03:46:43 Jacob Shields says, "I haven't tried sifting yet."

03:46:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snickers.

03:46:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:46:48 Katina says to Eli, "Whuh?"

03:47:01 Lily says to Jacob, "Well there's no points in that but you can pawn the stuff."

03:47:05 Jacob Shields says, "That's lovely, I think."

03:47:13 Eli raises his eyebrows at Katina and looks a little embarrassed.

03:47:14 Jacob Shields grins at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:47:15 Morris Corlew glances at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

03:47:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.

03:47:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well wait to see what you find! Then report back to me!"

03:47:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smirks.

03:47:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:47:26 Jacob Shields giggles.

03:47:27 You laugh.

03:47:32 Morris says to Eli, "Pretty sure ya don't wanna use that one Eli. Ya might end up with a human ya nickname Lil Blue."

03:47:36 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

03:47:37 Jacob Shields says, "I will, I'm sure."

03:47:37 Katina Faye gasps.

03:47:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "The breakfast squad is busy saving galaxy or some such."

03:47:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:47:52 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

03:47:58 Jacob Shields asks, "Breakfast?"

03:47:59 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The breakfast squad."

03:48:00 Morris Corlew frowns.

03:48:02 Jacob Shields says, "I like food."

03:48:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Yes."

03:48:24 Jacob Shields says, "Food is good for the me. It helps the me exist. I like existing."

03:48:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Sadly, Best closed the breakfast squad."

03:48:31 Patriot Constantine Stone exclaims, "Breakfast squad of syrup suits hired by Big Harry's! Waffle production quadrupled!"

03:48:37 Morris Corlew gives Jacob Shields some credits.

03:48:40 Jacob Shields grins.

03:48:42 Morris says to Jacob, "There. No need to go siftin."

03:48:46 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey exclaims, "Absolutely no nanites in the syrup!"

03:48:50 Jacob Shields asks, "None?"

03:48:51 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hardly any."

03:48:53 Jacob Shields gasps.

03:49:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:50:00 You say, "Yeah, I should start wandering towards bed soon."

03:50:05 You say, "Unfortunately."

03:50:15 Jacob Shields says, "Haven't had a decent breakfast in a couple days. Hell I haven't eaten a whole lot, come to think of it."

03:50:20 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Come on stick your tongue out against Outccord right now!"

03:50:22 Eli says to Constantine, "I meant to ask you."

03:50:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pats a Tardick lizard named Asteria lightly.

03:50:35 Jacob Shields grins.

03:50:40 Eli says to Constantine, "You knew about the guy before the headline, did they tell you on the terminal? What exactly did they say?"

03:50:51 You say, "I would much rather not fall asleep in the space port."

03:50:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow."

03:50:56 Jacob Shields nods.

03:51:05 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "No, I just kind of intuited that such a job might originated from the office."

03:51:08 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "And found him in there."

03:51:12 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "The terminal is still silent."

03:51:18 Jacob Shields says, "Falling asleep in the spaceport, even in the lounge, is a bad idea."

03:51:19 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh wow."

03:51:19 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Might originate, rather."

03:51:21 Katina Faye walks west.

03:51:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'm not even sure how you knew to even be looking for such a thing. I really didn' tthink it was going to invovle civilian pilots."

03:51:43 Katina Faye walks in from the west.

03:51:53 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I didn't either, but that was some chatter on general about it."

03:51:57 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "And it got me thinking about it."

03:51:58 Morris says to Eli, "From the wordin I kinda figured it might."

03:52:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I wonder if he's been there since yesterday, then."

03:52:13 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't think so."

03:52:22 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I definitely checked at one time and I don't think he was there."

03:52:24 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I could be wrong."

03:52:26 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But that uniform sticks out."

03:52:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

03:52:42 Morris Corlew says, "Like a sore thumb."

Given the development of recent events, I would like the League to offer asylum to any AEU citizens wishing to flee from Best and his regime. I myself am willing to offer free transport to anyone wishing to escape the AEU.

13:32:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:33:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:33:17 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

13:33:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

13:33:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:33:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:33:35 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:33:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:33:38 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

13:34:07 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

14:03:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

14:20:09 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Philosophy.

14:21:21 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Morning."

15:03:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

15:33:17 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Whoever's in the Vortex courier, hold still for five minutes or so!"

15:33:28 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Sure, sure."

16:00:06 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Quick question for you fine folks. Where might I acquire a hand-held holovid? I've been meaning to get one for a while, but I'm not sure where I'd need to go or how much I can expect to spend on one."

16:00:38 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Landfall has a gadget store."

16:01:21 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Awesome! I'll look there."

16:03:06 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

16:11:37 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Is the gadget shop located within the market or somewhere else in the city? Not familiar with landfall's layout, sadly."

16:12:25 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "It is not in the market. Go past the park, it's along that street."

16:12:45 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Awesome. Thanks man."

I will have to see where all of this is going. the last thing I want to do is leave my brothers and sisters in arms because I don't like something. But if we all do this together and work with each other it could work. Then I might consider the offer. But as of right now I want to wait a bit and see how things develop. No use in self-destructing the ship if you only have one turret that can't be repaired, is there?

Right so, while it would be grand to take all the good AEU people in, something like this would have to be done through our political channels. It's probably an idea you'd want to discuss with government officials. Especially if you are wanting to do it in massive numbers. While I believe anybody can ask for asylum, it is up to the government whether to grant it or not.

16:30:24 You glance at your communicator's screen.

16:30:24 There is one board post.

16:30:28 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

16:30:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

16:30:32 You're already sitting.

16:30:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

16:30:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location.

16:30:50 You scramble to your feet.

16:30:50 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:30:51 You exit the ship.
[The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

16:30:53 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Philosophy.

16:30:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

16:30:57 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

16:30:58 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

16:30:58 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

16:30:59 I don't understand that.

16:31:02 I don't understand that.

16:31:05 Board what?

Personally I think it would be a much better solution to fix the problem instead of applying a bandaid solution by creating an entire refugee culture from dissatisfied citizens. that's just me though.

21:21:20 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah but it's how I talk naturally."

21:22:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "So, it's still asking us to butcher our language while denouncing Tanny's butchering of it."

21:22:35 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Not Kelsey-type pirates, ya scurvy dog. Ancient pirates, skull and crossbones, all that shit."

21:22:44 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

21:23:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Is that how they really talked, or somethin some author or holovidmaker thought up?"

21:28:17 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Aye!"

21:29:32 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "But then misfortune would befall the ignoble buccaneers, and then the treasure maps would be lost until some young lad or lass uncovered it in their grandparents' attic."

21:29:53 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Happened all the time."

21:29:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wait...if they were buried in the sand, how'd the end up in an attic?"

21:33:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "So...mating and not light boning, and...somehow...nope. I'm just gonna stay totally confused here."
