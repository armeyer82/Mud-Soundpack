00:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

04:51 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:51 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:51 There are no other ships in the sector.

04:51 The computer reports that the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" has launched from New Earth.

04:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:51 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "beep beep"

04:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:52 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

The computer reports that the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" has jumped into the sector.

04:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:52 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:52 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:53 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:53 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:53 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

13:20 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

13:20 There appear to be about 5 pilots recently active.

13:20 The communicator network detects:
Shule Elemmire  (A) [m]
Isaac Strickland  (A)
Wendy Arroyo  (L)
Ted Warburton  (F)
Your communicator also reports that there is 1 pilot who was active but dropped out of communications.
Additionally, there are 11 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 16 pilots.
