-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Merry Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event!

This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However, we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make sure everyone gets a gift!

First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and celebration a little closer to the holiday!

Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos
02:58 , custom hair styles, small "plastic surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much, please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to add additional lines of text!

Thank you!
   Announced 6 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds ago

02:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

16:01 [Tactical Communication] Isaac Strickland transmits, "If it's needed to get the ball rolling, I could go for a nest."

16:01 Lily says to you, "Guess I need expedition grade sensors on here for the Graviton and the next power enhancement thing."

16:01 You say, "Oh, ok."

16:01 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Then we need one more."

16:01 You say, "Well, that'll be tough to get."

16:07 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

16:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:07 You say, "I haven't been over there this year."

16:07 You grin.

16:07 Lily Kaise nods.

16:07 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:07 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

16:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

16:08 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:08 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

16:08 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

16:08 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'William Dove.' Welcome to Mir."

16:08 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders.

16:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:08 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

16:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:09 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

16:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

16:09 Lily Kaise says, "Who knows, if we weren't in attendance we may be out of luck."

16:09 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

16:09 Lily Kaise falls from your lap.

16:09 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:09 You laugh.

16:09 Lily Kaise joins your group.

16:09 You say, "Sorry hun."

Lily Kaise followed you.

16:09 a mantel covered with an unlikely number of stockings

16:09 This is a mantel above a cozy brick fireplace. Fortunately, there is no fire burning, as that could be rather suicidal aboard a space station, but the holographic flames are a nice effect.

16:10 You peer north...

16:10 
[Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders; Icy's Ornamentation Destination]
Thousands of varieties of sparkly ornaments reflect and refract the illumination from the holiday-related lights of all sizes and colors which are blinking incessantly. Millions of filaments on thousands of yards of garland further enhance the light, filling the entire room with a cheery holiday glow. Larger decorations, meant to top the tree, are lighted in dozens of varieties of blinking and chasing patterns. It might be faster to just say that you're pretty much blinded here.
You see a trash can here.
You can go south.

16:23 You are at the top of a very steep slope which seems much larger than should be possible for this structure to contain. The slope soon disappears into a dark tunnel, and you cannot make out what might lie below. Contestants happily and eagerly grab one of the available sleds, grow ever more hesitant as they approach the start of the slope, then, after a long pause, are unceremoniously shoved forward by an elven attendant and begin their swift descent whilst gripping their sled in abject terror. In short, it looks fun!
You can go east and down.

16:23 You grab a sled and slowly haul it close to the edge, then lie down on it and pause for a long moment. A nearby attendant elf notices your hesitation, sighs, and nudges you forward with a shoe tipped with a bell. You shriek in terror as your uncontrollable descent begins.

16:23 You slide straight down the sheer slope at tremendous and terrifying speed!
(15 seconds roundtime.)

16:23 Your sled diverts itself from the main track suddenly, and you slow abruptly as the ground levels off. A small snowman looms ahead and impact seems inevitable, but your sled continues to slow and stops just before annihilating the happy snowy fellow.

16:23 (8 seconds roundtime.)

16:23 The small snowman studies you for a moment, then says, "You are in the realm of Icy the Snowfish. If you wish for him to grant you favors, you must first correctly answer a series of questions... of GRADUALLY ASCENDING DIFFICULTY. Question the first..."

16:24 Your sled again diverts itself from the main track and gradually slides to a stop in front of a medium-sized snowman.

16:30 You pass a bright orange sign before you have time to understand it. A moment later, you work out what it said: "TRACK UNFINISHED AHEAD."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

18:14 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver cer

18:15 You subside into silence as your eyes grow large and round, and eventually glaze over. Time passes.

18:15 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles and a long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles suddenly fly toward each other and impact in a tangle of tentacles.

18:17 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

18:17 Lily says to you, "You ok love?"

18:17 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

18:17 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Yep."

18:18 Lily Kaise says, "I won't fix anything until I attempt the sled again."

18:18 You say, "Oh."

18:18 You say, "'yeah, you do."

18:18 You say to Lily, "I swear I didn't do it."

18:18 You grin.

18:19 Lily Kaise asks, "But you got a funny expression on your face I was wondering what that was about?"

18:19 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

18:20 Lily Kaise says, "Ok here I go maybe I'll figure this out."

18:20 Lily Kaise laughs.

18:20 Lily Kaise kisses you.

18:20 Lily Kaise glides out.

18:20 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

18:21 Lily Kaise yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.
