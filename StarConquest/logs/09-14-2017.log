00:03:00 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:03:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

00:17:44 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "10stop the Patriots before it's too late! They're taking the Union from us bit by bit and Outccord will be their biggest step yet!"

00:17:52 [General Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "Miscom."

00:17:58 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Eli Grey transmits, "Stop the Patriots before it's too late! They're taking the Union from us bit by bit and Outccord will be their biggest step yet!"

00:18:48 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That, was a glorious miscomm."

00:19:05 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Needed that to go to the people who apparently still need to hear it. Something that the rest of human space seems to be already all too aware of."

00:19:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But next time...you should really try telling us exactly how you feel. I don't think we quite got that."

00:20:02 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Best needs to be investigated and probably locked up, how's that?"

00:20:06 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Eve."

00:20:24 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well, that's probably more the angle I'd have expected."

00:20:34 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hi."

00:22:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Any ideas Shule?"

00:22:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I wish I had some ideas of what we could do."

00:23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I put up some plaques on each planet, in what I thought would be heavily traveled areas, urging people to rise up and do something before it's too late."

00:23:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, I'm frankly shocked that the strike hasnt' even been addressed."

00:24:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah,m me too."

01:31:35 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Whoa that was cray, soem kind of blur of a starship over Hyperion."

01:31:45 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It was all kinds of blurry."

01:31:46 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "That was me Eli."

01:31:51 [General Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

01:32:41 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Anything can be blurry if one wears glasses and then covers them in a viscid substance."

01:33:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's kind of interesting that the planets that were for Garner are the ones around Cheyanne's Star. And the Patriot ones are the other star."

01:34:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Also, all the ones with all the good stuff on it. The research labs on Aenea, Revo and Gal-Kit on endymion, and Hyperion Security on Hyperion."

01:34:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That is interesting."

01:34:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Though I suppose they probably make the clipper on New Earth."

01:36:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The Patriots should be kicked out of office the way they want to kick good, tax-paying citizens out of their homes just because they weren't born here."

03:25:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops."

03:25:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.

03:25:10 Lily says to you, "So how was yesterday? Did you get rid of many traders?"

03:25:20 You say, "Only a couple."

03:25:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well a couple are more!"

03:25:39 You grin.

03:29:47 You say, "I'm still not able to come to work as much as I'd like."

03:30:09 You say, "And therefore, chase off as many merchant traders as I'd like."

03:31:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah Love I so wish I could do more and it's just horrible how some like Morris and Evenia and others have exploited the fact that I'm not as able to do as much as Eli."

03:40:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm afraid that this mess might have already cost us a cadet or two."

03:41:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's very unnerving that there's been no reaction or response to what we've been doing."

03:41:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I would probably want to do work if SEAS weren't shut out now."

03:43:04 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:47:00 Lily says to you, "Do you mind taking us over to Accord Love? I want to checkout what level of Battle Scanner we can qualify for."

03:47:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:47:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I say screw those others. If they don't want to allow us to participate, we'll build our own."

03:48:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:48:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli so just you know, if we go off strike, Seas will build their own Battle Scanner."

03:48:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:48:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Especially if others continue to be separetists. Imagine that too! And we're the ones they're accusing of just that behavior."

03:49:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There is a convenient spot just west of New Earth."

03:51:49 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:51:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:51:53 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Sure."

03:51:55 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:51:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

03:52:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:52:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

03:52:08 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

03:52:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:52:11 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:52:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:52:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just curious to see what we can qualify for."

03:52:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

03:52:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:52:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:52:18 You say, "No problem."

03:52:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:52:19 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

03:52:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:52:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:52:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:52:24 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:52:25 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

03:52:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:52:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:52:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:52:29 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:52:30 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

03:52:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:52:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:52:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:52:34 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:52:35 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

03:52:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock One).

03:52:37 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Deadly Strike. Welcome to Accord space."

03:52:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:53:00 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:53:00 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:53:05 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

03:53:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:53:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:53:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

03:53:18 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:53:27 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

03:53:30 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

03:53:30 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

03:54:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Be right back."

03:54:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

03:54:28 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:54:28 You say, "Ok."

04:00:20 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Eve, you want some help building that station later? Break up the monotony of running off merchants?"

04:01:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "At the very least, I'll need someone to run off unfriendly friends."

04:01:17 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Unfriendly friends?"

04:02:48 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "People you don't want hanging around when you're building a station."

04:03:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Don't worry. I'm headed south."

04:03:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles.

04:03:12 [General Communication] Eli Grey laughs.

04:03:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ain't gonna be there to bother the constructor in my puny lil capsule."

04:03:50 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Cheri is in love, see holovid at noon."

04:03:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

04:03:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "With whom?"

04:03:58 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Aww."

04:04:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well it's aboard Mel's ship. Not the constructor. Hence why I'll need someone to chase off unfriendly friends."

04:04:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

04:04:24 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hehe Cheri, how sweet."

04:04:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well I'd never do anything untoward to Mel's ship."

04:04:31 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Good for her."

04:04:45 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

04:04:45 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's either me or a felo."

04:04:48 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels whistles.

04:04:50 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

04:05:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "She could do much worse."

04:05:39 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:05:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

04:05:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on your lap.

04:05:52 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:05:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well we're not in terrible shape!"

04:05:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

04:06:05 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:06:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We can certainly put up a battle scanner and xenology and salvage and even Rift Accelerators but unfortunately, we can't get a rift Inserter."

04:06:47 You say, "Ah, ok."

04:08:13 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

04:08:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "That's so depressing, we were doing so good."

04:09:32 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Disappointed it wasn't you Morris?"

04:09:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:09:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:09:55 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:10:00 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

04:10:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:10:00 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I think I missed something."

04:10:05 You're already sitting.

04:10:08 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

04:10:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm c=mi% back."

04:10:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:10:12 Which sector did you mean?

04:10:12 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)

04:10:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:10:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:10:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:10:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:10:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:10:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:10:21 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

04:11:04 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Run about it in it, of course."

04:11:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:11:11 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:11:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:11:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:11:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:11:27 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:11:28 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:11:31 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:11:32 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:11:38 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I can do that in anything."

04:11:44 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'd still like to see what three of them does to a platform."

04:14:44 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh wait."

04:14:53 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Wow, they are selling it for just 180 million, pretty sure it was sold last time for 250 million."

04:14:56 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That statement makes no sense. Hermes doesn't make the bullet."

04:15:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, y'all ain't mad at United Freight &eithe!."

04:15:26 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Haha really."

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee appliqued with small neon purple flowers, a pair of tight white denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset w
20:11:23 ith a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying Prissy the sleeping big violet long-haired felo in her right hand.

20:11:56 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:11:56 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:11:57 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:12:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:12:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:12:12 The ship is already moving.

20:12:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:12:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:12:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:12:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:12:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:12:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:12:21 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

23:35:55 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:35:55 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

23:37:55 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

23:37:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:37:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:38:04 You peer out...

23:38:04 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The advanced scout "Celtic Rose" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

23:38:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:38:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:38:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:38:16 There are no other ships in the sector.

23:38:20 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

23:38:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:38:23 Which sector did you mean?

[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

23:38:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:38:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:38:26 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:38:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:38:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:38:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:38:32 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:38:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

23:38:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:38:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:38:37 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:38:40 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:39:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:39:39 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:39:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:39:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:39:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:39:54 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:39:54 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
