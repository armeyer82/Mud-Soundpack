Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a
glass top, and a pair of violet red leather boots decorated with neon red stars
here.
You can go out.

"Well we shouldn't stop sending our messages forward. It's hard at times to know

our government."

yeah, it's starting to look to me like the measures are pointless and we can't
stop it."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an
alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny
station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the
Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order
is entered."
Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike!

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay
One.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a
small red insulated cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid
service robot here.

available very much but I will restore it. I needed to get the Warehouse started
up and I didn't have time to wait for you or Constantine."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Constantine,
did you still feel like doing that other thing?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You mean
blow it up?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you
think that will help?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I honestly
don't know. I know it would help to shatter this illusion tha the corps is
divided. I can try the other thing we talked about first though, if you'd
rather."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er. The
illusion that the corps is divided."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We'll try th
other thing first, I suppose."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What was
the other thing - the permit?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We can
blow it up."
[AEU | 3: Trade Information] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Merchants, stop
your trading! Every credit you make, every resource you trade, goes towards
plans that will give the Outsiders the advantage! Stop Outccord now!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hello."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey
Vernos."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a
plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when
it can't break the toy.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What are you blowing
up?"
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Camp?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A poisoned
apple."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Give me 5 and yes."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hmm can I observe or
take part?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If we go
through with it, I'll be doing one of mine as well. If you have something you
want to do it to as well, it coudl only help."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its
claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But nobody's
gonna pressure anyone."
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "What's your highest tier, Alko?"
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Fringe 5."
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Right. Bring that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That goes for
the other fols listening as well, since we're talking about it on comms
anyways."
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Confirmed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. folks,
not folls that would be silly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah
sorry about the lack of secrecy. I figure they'll probably just continue to do
nothing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh
oh, are we finally blowing up hardened asteroid haulers?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Personally, I
would like to do my Pulsar, in support of constantine doing his bribe fighter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or,  at the
very least, my regular fighter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That
goes back to the issue of blowing up warships, which I strongly advise against.
We want to be ready to fight enemy threats."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I personally
think blowing ships up will send the wrong message."
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I just jumped to earth as if
it's a nest..."
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel
like if I blow it up, there's really no reason to blow other stuff up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I
would be blowing the ship up for a specific reason."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well
currently the message is that the corps is divided on Outccord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
reason being how I got it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That could
very well be true constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But I wasn't
about to suggest it and not offer of doing something similar."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Also, as
much as I want to believe this would be viewed positively in the news, I'm just
not sure it will be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh it wont be."
A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They never just post
news headlines as they are. Got to twist them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I
even doubt the ISN would report my actions in a positive light."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises
its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while
dancing around it.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Im not blowing up warships that just sends
a very wrong message."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If anyone blows up warships, they better
kiss any opportunity to ever obtain a specialty warship goodbye."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Destroyers?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Great
ships, destroyers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What
about them?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Was considering
doing that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Blowing
up a destroyer?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Why?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "All
I can say Constantine is that blowing up combat ships sends a very very wrong
message. Also if you ever want to be considered for a Flare or a Pincer, you may
do yourself some damage there in terms of how you'dbe viewed in terms of how you
would take care of a highly subsidized privilege."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sugar coated answer
or how I really feel?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
expect I'd never get an application ship if I did that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Probably not."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't
really think it's a good idea."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "That's how I
think, Lily."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Why
sugar coat it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'll let you pick."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oops,
sorry."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Destruction
of ships just isnt the way to go in my opinon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "There's
really no reason to sugar coat things."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It
isn't because they are manufactured in limited quantities so ifw e were to be
besieged nd lose ships then there may not be replacements available as well."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
there's no replacing the prototype, anyway. I would only have destroyed it to
protest the reason that they gave it to me, but as I said, I don't think they'll
care."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I
don't think it would bring us any positive attention in the news."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Well think about consequences. A prototype is just that though and they won't
like it. Trust me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What are the
thoughts on inviting other alliances pilots to come to the protest, which will
hopefully be starting tomorrow around 20:00."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
know they won't like it, that's what I've been saying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Because Best is a
dumbass who twisted things to make it seem like I was on his side and frankly
I'd like to send a message that nothing would please me more than his sorry ass
spending his remaining years in the same manner as Sheffield in a cell."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I just
mean they won't care about my protest."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
they won't and the harm will be felt by you."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oops
mis-comm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I get
that, but how does blowing your ship up send that message?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like if
you wanted to send that message, you could just say that right into general over
comms or something."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As
for a protest I will try to be available. It would be interesting to see if
other alliances really are interested though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well I suppose he
did just get the message."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Why bother? To
me the other alliance pilots have made it very clear they in the end, don't
really give a shit what we do, they expect results from us yet really haven't
done anything on their end. Why would they help now?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
Tara the converse is to find out if they really do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
definitely get the frustration. I feel like we've been working hard for a way
out of this, and we just aren't finding one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "All they have
done is talk shit. That's what i've seen."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know
it's wearing on me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know
it's wearing on you, Vernos."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They
will always talk shit. That's their gang mentality for ya."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a
cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess
my main concern is that blowing the fighter up will only hurt me and not add
anything to the cause."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe
that's selfish."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't
think there's any reason to blow up your ships though, Vernos."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it
would show that they do give a shit if they show up. We are fighting against
isolationism, so I feel like attempting to include them shows that a bit more
than not including them. That's my take on it anyways."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Its not
selfish to be thinking of your future, Constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "You never
really planned or expected any of this to happen, yeah?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No
it's not It's being responsible and keeping yourself viable as a pilot
Constantine."
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Anyone up for a nest after
that?"
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I
definitely didn't."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You
know Constantine you could always tell them to take the Prototype back that it
doesn't represent your true sentaments. That is better than destroying a
prototype."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess
I could that, I didn't think of it because I don't know how I would."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe
I'll ask them to take it back through the terminal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, at the
very least you should perhaps sell it and make a declaration that you will not
be used as a pawn. Something like that anyways. Currently it appears to the
citizens and to the rest of the alliances,  that the corps is divided between
patriots and dissidents."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I would have
painted 'Fuck best' on the prototype then told them to take it back, if I had
been in your shoes, Constantine. I woulda been soooo pissed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When the
truth is, none of us are for Outccord or Best, unless I'm just wrong about
that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Send a letter to the Liaison or to whomever else you think you can communicate
and yeah I agree with tara hehe. Still, I wouldn't blow it up."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
should have just not picked it up at all. I only did because I was mad about it
and had sinister plans for it."
A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles
around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "None of
which were things that would have been good ideas."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "They kind of
fired our Liaison didn't they?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They
did fire him, but they're going to replace him, if they haven't already."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And
there are still other people in the office."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You folks who
have been labled as supportes, have had that done to you against your will. I
understand that being a patriot is not inherently bad, but in this instance it's
being used to create an illusion of support for Best. Now I don't know what you
guys can do about that but it's nto right that you're beign used in this way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright,
yeah, I'll try to return it to them, and if they won't take it back, I'll sell
it or something."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh
yeah well we all are entitled to our thoughts. It's what you do with them. This
is what we attempted in vain to communicate with that twit Tatiana who said she
wanted to launch beacons in Mutuality space to destroy humanity and then she
says it was just a thought. Well a thought which one should never communicate to
others."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "If anything,
sell it to the accord!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That
would probably put me in Dure."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Sometimes those are just our way of venting where you cannot. It's how one acts
and there re things best unsaid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
imagine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's just a
shame, really. The folks who are not striking are all newer pilots and doing so
for their own reasons. But it's being portrayed like you folks support Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, the
Accord are god guys, they likely would just not take it if it would cause a
problem."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. good
guys."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would
hope not, but I'm leery of even trying to sell it to them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I'll rename my
ships to 'screw outcord' and 'Best is stupid'. Does that help?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores snickers.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yeah that would be selling our tech to another alliance which is uh probably a
huge offense. Just give it back Constantine. Honestly do that and let them know
it's not for you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though I
still think that we could have those ships and stay in the Accord, just dedicate
a small percentage of the ships built to the Accord. That should take some of
the strain off of funding."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Of course,
funding is clearly not what they really want to leave the Accord for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
you do have a point, Eli. However, just going from what I've seen, I'm not sure
we can convince the other alliances that we're all united."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's
not that's just one of their excuses."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Either
because they don't want to believe it, or just because it's too late now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "But no, theres
not really much we can do about being labeled as patriots besides just being
vocal about our stance on it all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's not them
I want to convince. It's the citizens on the ground, the members of government
that don't know the whoel story."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
do wish we could get through to the citizens."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Unfortunately we've seen the tight grip they keep on the news in home space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I have
to believe any information about us being united just won't be passed on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "Perhaps the
protest will help with that then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I hope
so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Constantine,
they never believed we were united on this in the first place. They don't want
to be convinced, they just want something to point fingers at, blame, and laugh
at while they watch from the sidelines. That's the impression i've gotten from
the other alliance corps. I'm hoping Eli's protest proves me wrong."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "As long as we
get enough citizens out there, they'll likely get some news shots of it. It's
gonna have to be noticeable."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
it's not going to prove anything to just do nothing. We have to keep at it for
however long it will take. Yes it is exhausting in many respects but we must
exemplify that we shalll not be beaten down."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That is true
for some Tara, but not all the other alliances pilots are like that. There's
actually been some decent support coming out of both, It's just not very
public."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean you
are certainly right, there's been some douchy behavior, for sure. But not
everyone in those alliances feels the same way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Um.. who just
blew up over New Earth?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That
is true. Remember big mouths don't necessarily represent the majority."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I blew up a fighter,
eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Sorry, but
when experienced and much more veteran pilots gang up on and bully newer pilots
like my self and dakhal over the strike and the like, it has nothing to do with
the current situation."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "They just want
to be better then someone else."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh
well their mentality is to try to discourage newer pilots. I do believe it's
unnerving to other alliances that AEU is groing strong again as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "They just made
me more determined to work, honestly."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person medium transport "Fuller 'n A Tick". The organization has earned
1,613,793.19 credits.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh well that's not supporting our cause
but yeah. I can't tell a new pilot to not work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "Yeah, and our
performance was actually up from last time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
that's the other thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "People who
throw their longetivity as a pilot around expecting respect from me won't get
anything."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not
on my account heh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm
worried we have basically no bargaining power."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And
maybe we never did."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "You mean with
the Mutuality, Constantine?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "As a corps?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I
mean as a corps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We
definitely have none with the Mutuality."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I don't know,
some of the stuff that's been done has been noticed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He means that
with half of us working and half us not, we're not making a big enough impact to
make a difference. That's kinda what blowing up some ships was about too."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
I don't exactly agree as we have already been effective. Sometimes can only
accomplish a little at a time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Have we
been effective?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I'm
not trying to push anyone either way, I know it makes sense for some people to
work."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes
we've affected Merchant trading and well sometimes it takes awhile. Nothing can
happen overnight with issues this entrenched."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am
still willing to give money to anyone who wishes to take part in the strike but
who doesn't currently have the credits to support themselves! I am glorious
philanthropist."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
hope that's having an effect."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't
know about Tara, but for me the thing I miss the most is points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
money doesn't really matter one lick to me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bah,
points."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
know I've certainly run Merchants out of our space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bah,
I say."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I
said to Eli, I can pay my phone bill for like 150 more months."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "My investments
would support me just fine, its not about making money for me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Anyone but me Ather?
I actually meet both of those."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Its about
experience."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh
yeah, you can't have anything."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Well, I am conflicted about asking our new pilots to stop working. That is too
dictatorial. One can only hope that they will decide for themselves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
can get experience without working, depending on what kinda experience you're
aiming for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey laughs at Rogue Ace Pilot Ather
Jammoa.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That
is very true Ather."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Fair enough."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm
not telling them to not work. I'm simply informing them, that if they are
willing to go along with the strike, I would be happy to fund anything that they
might need for as long as it's ongoing."

communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
would support that as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh for sure,
I'm not about pressuring hte newer folks to strike. They're all practically
fresh out of pilot school into this mess."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "As
for the Mutuality..."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a
red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Honestly they enjoy toying with us at this point. While it would be prudent
once shit calms down to try to get assurances from the government that the AEU
navy will not launch attacks into Mutuality space, in exchange for the QSA stuff
and shared tech access or what have you, I'm still not really interested in
bending over backwards for a non-aggression pact by trying to waste time
figuring out what the fuck else they could possibly want. I mean, our shit is
more valuable than theirs. We have a non-aggression pact, it means they'll be
able to buy the revo, and the telex jackrabbit grid. What will we get? Shit. In
the form of Mutuality battlesuits. That's about the only worthwhile thing they
have for us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. All
the farport stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Wouldn't that fall under the QSA agreement, like it has for the last several
years?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
farport stuff doesn't require a nonagression pact."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
it sure would be great to be able to obtain their Exploration upgrades. I guess
we can live without them but here too since the aEU Government doesn't care for
us being Explorers, they certainly won't support us there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well yes, if
the old agreement had been renewed, but we're having to make a whole new
agreement I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The
mutuality didn't break off relations recently, they broke off relations since
the slave trade, remember. We were still able to buy all thee farport stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, you
are probably right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And
that's the key here. -we- didn't break off relations, -they- broke off
relations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would
like to at a minimum see the QSA access restored, but I agree that it won't
happen any time soon."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes
that's how I've gelt too but still, our Government did nothing by not showing up
when we are clearly under the Mutuality's thumb or such as it is."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Felt
that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We were set
up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
said yourself all they want is assurances that the AEU won't launch attacks into
their space. We get those assurance publically made by the government, that'll
give them what they want."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"We've always been set up every time since over the three and a half years I've
been a pilot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They didn't
send anyone, because they knew that we would, and then they could blame all the
tensions btween the Union and the Mutuality on us and lambeth."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yep."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person medium transport "The Huggy Pug". The organization has earned
1,701,697.60 credits.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what
makes me the most angry about all of this. Everyone is getting treated like
pawns in Best's game. At no point have they even tried to address the concerns
we've expressed, or tried to deal with anything. I mean, don't even folks who
support Best want the strike to end? And yet there's been no attempt made at all
to try to talk to us or anything. Instead they just move everyone around like
game pieces."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well,
I can understand why they're not backing down."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Also,
from their perspective, it doesn't matter what we say, work still gets done."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's not
about backign down, they haven't even tried to engage the corps through the
terminal. They're just pretendin glike it's not happening."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The
simple fact of the matter is, pilots have always been quicker to cave than the
government. They're waiting for it to happen again. In a sense, it already has a
few times before people have reaffirmed one thing or another about the strike."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "True
as we won't back down nor will they so we have to continue our rpessure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Wait,
tensions, Us?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores coughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Flottilla?
Hello?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores coughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, it's
very obvious where the tensions came from. But the Patriots are painting their
own picture to the citizens of the Union."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They
specifically are using lambeth as a scapegoat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "And to put
someone more favoring them in postion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Take
for example, temporary stations. I'll be honest, I didn't even think that they
would contribute stuff to the alliance, though logic should've dicated that they
would've. Technically, as long as we're participating in the temporary stations
that gain shit for AEU-based organizations, the alliance is gaining resources
from them, because they get a cut of those resources. Kim was right to stop
giving parts for those. It's why I said that invaders parts are to not be used
until further notice."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person medium transport "Fuller 'n A Tick". The organization has earned
2,718,563.44 credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah
they can all decide to renounce their titles individually if they are truly with
us. Otherwise, they are certainly free to carry on as Patriots if this what they
individually or collectively believe in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep,
exactly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Patriot to me
means I support the AEU and its people. Not the government, Lily."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh
kim did go right out and buy parts Ather."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They
are in Starseeker's ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But
for what kinds of stations? Asteroid processors? Salvage processors? Or just the
beacon stations?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And
she used some of our Megacredits to purchase them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Is that
really why you think they gave you that tag though Tara? I understand your point
on that completely, but that's certainly not the message that's getting sent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
have industrial parts in invaders warehouse. It doesn't mean that I'm using
them."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
Kim purchased them the very next afternoon when Evangeline said otherwise."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Kim has
basically been gone for the past month."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't
think she had an active role in any of this."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She popped in
very briefly,  but didn't nkow much about what was going on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "How'd she top
the conquest results then?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If she
is "striking," it's by virtue of not wanting to do anything to begin with."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably belt
managementtran 1 She popped in very briefly,  but didn't nkow much about what
was going on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
she probably collected belt points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. probably
belt management."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's
the other thing about pilot strikes, how do they even know we're just not
working for unrelated reasons?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "There
are tons of pilots on the payroll who never come on comms."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
can show our financial log or you can go look that up Constantine. I was rather
shocked when after Melinda posted to general that Kim went right out and
purchased 2 solar panels and I think it was three Fission Breeder Reactors with
our megacredits included."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a
red glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like the
government might well just be saying Huh, looks like Constantine is taking an
extended break."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "As he
has done in the past."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And as
Akira has done for months and months."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "As have
many others."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I'm
sure they are aware of you being part of the merchants thing constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But I do see
your point."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"That was rather sneaky if she truly didn't want their parts going onto
income-yielding stations."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I doubt
she meant to be sneaky, but of course I'm not in her head. She probably just
didn't know what was happening."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Kinda like
how I was happy Tara was not around when the strike started, because that at
least meant she was not working, though it did not mean she had joined the
strike officially."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Well she doesn't deserve anyone's excuses. Trust me she is not a very honest
individual. I have personal eperience."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Experience."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "I won't be able
to avoid it no matter what I do, Eli."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So
does Shule which is one reason why he left Starseekers. I formed this
organizaiton prior to then and I never asked him to leave Starseekers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Avoid what?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I just
meant when you were on tha texpidition, at least you weren't here contributing
at the beginning of the strike."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
that surprises me. Kim has always been pretty nice to me. If you don't mind, I
might ask to hear about it sometime."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So it helped
a little, without you havign to directly join."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh
heh that is her tactic."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "This whole
issue, if I do nothing, I'm basically making an idiot of myself with the goals I
set as being a pilot, and I always finish what I start, if I do stuff as a
pilot, it makes it seem like I support the government."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "So its a lose
lose for me."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "She
wanted me in seekers, too, but I thought I would like the atmosphere here more."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I can
certainly understand that. Though the idea is not to keep this up forever heh."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I
do."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And
seekers has basically collapsed, so I chose correctly."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
actually sympathize with you more than you know, Tara."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ideally it'll
end sooner than later."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "I wanted to be
an explorer, more then anything. You can't believe how dissapointed I was when I
learned the AEU isnt putting much stock in exploration. Its really
disheartening."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores sighs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Haha well You tte me as I am and I am not a bullshitter. It may shock some but
I will never be more than honest and open and independent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know
what you mean. I think we can still take the reins back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "When
this mess is over we'll have a meeting about it."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We
can and we shall!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Once this
stuff is settled, I'm goign to start running expidtions. If we can show that
it's beneficial to explore, we'll tart getting more development for stuff like
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though.. my
first expidition will likely be very interesting. without Farport upgrades it's
gonna be kind of bare bones, but so be it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "Consider it a
test."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Thatwe shall and even if my brain doesn't heal up from the head injury from
when I lost the little bit of Starcharting skill I had, that hasn't stopped me
from exploring. I just haven't had a lot of time lately to lead others."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Rest Station from the two-person
light transport "Rhino". The organization has earned 305,222.65 credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "It shows ones
skill if you can make do without advantages others have that you don't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There
are still exploration options available to us. There always were. Yes, it's
true, that people couldn't explore at this current time in anything better than
a tactical platform, unless they do what Jonathan Gray did, and piggyback on
friends from other alliances. However, a tactical platform can still go a
considerable distance. Back when Annie was around, we took a tactical platform
all the way to the folks at Gunarsh, who were as yet previously undiscovered.
Now there are shuttles that we can attach that can take them even farther out. I
will only grant that at the moment, new tactical platforms cannot be bought
and/or outfitted. However, it's not like there are none unavailable to AEU
pilots at the moment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ouch Lily, I
hadn't hueard about that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The
simple fact of the matter however, is people chose not to use these avenues of
exploration. So, that's why exploration budgets were cut back so much."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh
it sure can."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "I've been
looking at the tactical platform as an option, Ather."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey
you guys, once we've gotten to some point with the Accord issue at least, we
will be doing an artifacting trip. Unfortunately, we can't take many so we will
have to limit who we can invite other than ourselves."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "Alright! Cool!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily
also makes a huge mistake in believing that starcharts are critical to
expeditions; they're not. You can navigate almost as effectively with the NDB.
Starcharts are mostly useful for getting from point A to point B. When you're
out just exploring, there's no real practical use in a chart."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So
please keep it under wrtps."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We
could fit 1 module scout and 4 scouts in a carrier, right?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "More
ships if we bring shuttles. I hope to have access to the worse shuttle soon."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No
no I'm not saying taht Ather but I'd have felt a little more assurance on my own
with others less experienced."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, Ather,
that's how we navigated on the expedition I went on recently."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So do we
know that even Helios rentals are off limits?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That
has not yet been confirmed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "One of
our cadets had a rental suit, so I thought we could still get some things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I do
really want a platform. I was hoping I could at least still get that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
probably could get us within range of Feng Wo but with those crazy sRiftstorms
out there, it's challenging and we did actually get off course and it did
require some charting to get us in range of Feng Wo this last time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well,
Agnar is...not relaly a part of the Mutuality. He rents to pretty much anyone.
Heck, he rents to Mr. Kelsey. Rented to him even before the Mutuality and the
tandem pact decided to be stupid and include him in their circle."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe
it's worth a shot, then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll see
if Eve can run me out there sometime."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Beta.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a
