-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:12 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.
(You are lying on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.)

19:12 You blink heavily and then doze off.

19:14 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Arch site?"

19:14 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Sure."

19:14 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "I'm in."

19:14 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Oh come on."

19:15 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "But sure."

19:15 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Full."

19:15 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Who is repairing?"

19:15 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I can."

19:17 Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo wanders in from the north.

19:21 Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo wanders out.

21:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ugh. My sleep schedule changed drastically recently."

21:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm going to make every effort but I don't know if I can last until ten."

21:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Ah, I sympathize. But I do hope you last until ten. I believe a couple of our cadets have stated they will try to be there as well."

21:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits an irritating burst of static.

21:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Er, sorry. That is good."

21:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "We have had a few cycle through without reaching their full license during the course of your expedition, however, so I cannot say if they will last."

21:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah we have a lot of retention issues. Honestly so many of us being gone probably didn't help."

21:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Agreed. I was able to offer pointers here and there, but I am not quite well grounded enough to confidently take people out on beacons or any such thing."

21:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We'll get you there. I should be back to work more regularly in a couple days."

21:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I am happy to hear it. It will be nice having others around with a measure of consistency. I do think I managed to keep rather productive myself, in the interim. I made a small fortune and then spent it all."

21:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

21:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's the pilot's curse. Buy anything good?"

21:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "A rift drive for my scout and a two-person transport were the largest purchases, but they've proven quite valuable to have. Then various ship upgrades and, ahm. A few small fighters, during my period of learning the nature of solo beacons."

21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh cool, congrats on the drive. And don't worry about the fighters, we've all lost several."

21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I once bought and outfitted a new fighter to use on very high beacons."

21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I forgot to put a battery on it though."

21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Oh dear."

21:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Needless to say I was blown up immediately."

21:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Batteries and engines do make those beacons far more manageable. Though highs and very highs will be out of reach for a time."

21:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll be doing highs pretty soon I'm sure. I think you only really need about 1000 combat for the best stuff."

21:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The engine and lasers that is."

21:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "True, though I only passed three hundred early this morning, so that still feels a way off. But I am not too impatient on that point."

23:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Hmm."

23:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wow, are we relaly the only two active pilots for this meeting?"

23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "It looks as though we are. I was starting to grow concerned that I had the time wrong."

23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You don't, you don't. This is disappointing, especially due to what I wanted to share with the corps."
