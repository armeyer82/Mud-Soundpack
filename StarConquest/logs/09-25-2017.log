00:37:17 Your communicator reports that...

00:37:17 
At least five recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

00:37:27 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

00:38:23 You say to Lily, "Looks like the party is ver at Old Earth as usual, we can go over there if you feel like being social."

00:40:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

00:40:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Not that I feel like partying."

00:41:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm also leary that they are going to pump us for information and at this point, I think we shouldn't say a lot."

00:41:48 You say, "I definitely don't, but I was just offering if you would like to."

00:41:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Thank you love."

00:41:59 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Yeah, me too."

00:44:12 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Anyone up for some beacons? Or maybe a nest or 2?"

00:44:17 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Me."

00:44:19 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah."

00:44:30 [Tactical Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Aww i'm way out here or else I would... aww, dang, I want nests."

00:44:33 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Nests me."

00:44:50 You say, "Ather is considering calling off the strike, but he wants to have a meeting first."

00:45:19 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Kert, you've got a suit already?"

00:45:40 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "No, I'll be able to do ship defense and such as that, no ground combat training yet."

00:48:17 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Was hopeing to get people for cruiser beacons but hmmm."

00:51:49 Lily says to you, "I am so relieved that you didn't get caught up in the ship destrucitons. I just couldn't handle it."

00:51:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Destructions that is."

00:52:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know I'd probably quit piloting."

00:54:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

00:54:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I think we have to stop too many horrible things have happened."

00:54:56 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Kert is not responding, anyone would like to fill that place? We need a fourth for that nest to happen."

00:55:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This has already hurt our growth as the newer pilots are just not showing up now."

00:55:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ironically too when we nee so desperately to grow our personnel."

00:55:43 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Sorry. I was dozing."

00:55:50 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Oh, ok."

00:55:52 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I'll wake up now. What can I do. Sorry again."

00:56:03 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "You have a suit already?"

00:56:51 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh. I did answer that earlier. No I haven't been trained in ground combat. All I've learned to do so far would be gunning. I've soloed some combat with my fighter so have the basic idea of piloting and engineering though."

00:57:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll tell you this, if Vernos is the default replacement for Constantine, I will run for Voice again. I will do it with clenched teeth though as I really don't want it but we can't allow Vernos."

00:57:44 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok, Melinda also asked you if you need ground combat training?"

00:58:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't want this mess."

00:59:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I would take it on and do the best I could. I really believe Dakhal is way inexperienced. He just doesn't show enough initiative yet whereas Constantine was way ahead of most pilots even at his experience level."

00:59:14 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "You will not be able to join that nest without a suit, so you can start joining once you have one."

00:59:31 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yeah, I need ground combat training, and a suit."

00:59:53 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr cheers.

01:00:07 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "When are you free to help with that?"

01:00:17 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr gasps.

01:00:28 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I'm at old earth, in my ship. Where to meet. Lounge?"

01:01:10 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Just a bit of information. Let's try to save tactical for important tactical stuff."

01:02:00 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Michael, damien and chase, what suit do you have?"

01:02:14 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Fringe 2 and rental 2 as well."

01:02:27 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "All I got low tier is my tier 2 rental."

01:02:49 [Tactical Communication] Chase Marshall transmits, "Rental one."

01:06:51 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I agree."

01:07:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

01:07:45 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

01:08:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So yeah we need to call this off and probably not for all the right reasons as we still need to resist the government. We can still protest."

01:08:05 You nod.

01:08:34 You say, "If I were to run for voice, I have no idea who would be SDC. Normally, I'd just let Ather take it, but he can't."

01:08:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I probably will do as little as possible but I will go on the artifacting trip if it goes forward as like you I know we need a break."

01:09:00 You nod.

01:09:26 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:09:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sadly there would probably be room for your Sightseer too but I'd be fine for us to share Happy."

01:10:09 You say, "I'd want to be with you."

01:10:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Me with you too."

01:10:32 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

01:11:12 You say, "Maybe, I'm not always around during the day either."

01:11:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:11:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well we'll make it work."

01:11:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

01:32:00 I don't understand that.

01:32:03 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:32:05 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Anyone else would like to join nests, or beacons?"

01:32:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

01:32:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

01:32:21 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:34:30 You say to Lily, "I love you."

01:34:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

01:34:48 Lily says to you, "I so love you and I ams o glad you are still here."

01:34:53 You beam at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:35:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I feel as though a huge hole has ben ripped open amongst us."

01:35:23 You nod.

01:35:25 You say, "I know."

01:35:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I thank the stars taht you didn't get caught up in it."

01:36:06 You say, "I wouldn't have agreed to crash the ships like that."

01:36:10 You frown.

01:36:25 You say, "Self-destructing is one thing, but crashing ships..."

01:36:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok I'm glad as I know how it is to be caught-up in the passion amidst the circumstatnces."

01:37:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Circumstances."

01:37:08 You nod.

01:37:13 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

01:37:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just wonder why neither of them questioned it."

01:37:28 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

01:37:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Initially I thought it was Constantine but it's evident that eli was just as much of a player."

01:38:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

01:38:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is like the worst nightmare."

01:39:02 You nod.

01:39:14 You say, "I'm really surprised that Eli was ok with it."

01:39:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah me too."

01:40:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If it turns out that this is what Ather mandated, I uh uh... uh I don't think I could ever face Ather ever again."

01:40:31 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:40:50 You say, "Then I really think he should go to prison too if that's the case."

01:41:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I will personally petition to never allow him to regain his original piloting status again."

01:41:32 You nod. "I'd gladly sign it."

01:41:46 You say, "Even if it means we lose our best combat pilot."

01:41:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

01:42:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well you are our best combat pilot."

01:42:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd hold you up against Ather any day."

01:42:20 You say, "Awww, thanks."

01:42:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You can handle anything he can and more."

01:42:39 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:42:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Now I would say that Ather is our best Ground Combat pilot though."

01:43:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm not too bad but I don't htink I'm up to his spec."

01:43:41 You say, "Oh, for sure."

01:43:55 You say, "I'm not very good at ground combat."

01:44:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If I still had sharting skill, I know I'd be his equal at this point."

01:44:22 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:44:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well as I say I know my stuff in terms of ground Combat but I'll give him the edge and he knows I know my stuff too."

01:44:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

01:44:46 You grin.

01:46:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We also don't have the historical knowledge that he has as well as Eli and that's oging to leave a huge gaping hole in our alliance if he is no longer around. Eli wan't active for about three years so i'm not saying I wouldn't miss him terribly but you know what I mean."

01:46:21 You nod.

01:46:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Eli wasn't."

01:50:01 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:50:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I should have brought her but we went rushing out pretty fast earlier."

02:50:58 You say, "Sure."

02:51:00 You say, "Let's."

02:51:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:51:02 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:51:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:51:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

02:51:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:51:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:51:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Thanks Love."

02:51:09 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:51:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:51:19 You say, "Anything for you."

02:51:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We can go back to New earth but I'd like to get her."

03:00:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident dangles a day old slice of three-meat pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

Star Conquest Help: Rerolling
--
Category: Background
--

Rerolling is the process of deleting your character and creating a new one. The term derives from tabletop roleplaying games, where a character's stats had to be determined from dice rolls, and thus to "reroll" was to start over with your character. In character in Star Conquest, this process is usually called "retiring" your character.

There are many reasons that people choose to reroll. The best reason to reroll is that you feel your current character's story has been told and you'd like to try something new. If this is your reason, and your character has been well-roleplayed and your account is in good standing, please use the SUPPORT command to speak to a host about your thoughts for ending your current character and transitioning to a new one. We can help you finish your character's story and often even arrange for some of your character's progress (usually just points) to be gradually transferred to the new character. If your character has NOT usually been well-roleplayed, we are less likely to do these things. Please read Policy 14: Minievents for more information.

You should not invent your own wild retirement stories, nor have your next character or your out-of-game friends try to invent things about your old character. In the past, we've had rerolled characters supposedly die in horrible accidents, be drafted into the navy, become an advisor to the president, and somehow turn into a giant Bari, all of which were incompatible with the game's theme. If you want a story for the end of your character besides quiet retirement, you MUST speak to a host.

We have stated the best reason to reroll. There are also many poor reasons to reroll, which are unfortunately more common than good ones. Here are some that we see regularly:

* You did something silly, such as attacking an alliance-mate, and you don't care for the consequences.

* You are unhappy with your organization, but talking to people is hard and rerolling is easy.

* You are unhappy with your boyfriend/girlfriend, but breaking up is frightening and rerolling is easy.

* You did something wrong out-of-character, such as scripting combat, and got a penalty.

There are two things that every good roleplayer learns to deal with: consequences and interpersonal conflict. You cannot expect your character to be happy all of the time. Sometimes, you will do things that your character will just have to live with. Sometimes, you will have to have hard, even unpleasant conversations with other characters. These things are all part of a character's story, not a reason to end it. It's the human experience.

Remember that bad things tend to pass. In roleplaying games, memories are short. If you did something bad, you can probably be turning over a new leaf by next month. If you're in the midst of a bad breakup, you'll probably both have moved on in two weeks. Think twice before destroying a long-term character over short-term issues. It's always better to weave something new into your character's tapestry than to rip the whole thing up and start over.

Playing through a bad situation makes both you and your character stronger. Rerolling is simply a passive-aggressive easy out. We will always encourage players to stick with their characters in situations like these.

If you are committed to rerolling, there is one more important "don't": this is not the time to take parting shots at your former friends, your alliance, your organization, etc., nor is it time to suddenly launch your finest warship with guns blazing to see how much damage you can do. Doing these things with the knowledge that your character won't last the hour is out-of-character and essentially metagaming. If you are going to have it out with other characters, make it part of the ongoing story. The alternative may be satisfying for you, but it's frustrating for everyone else.

If you rerolled purely to avoid consequences or for other essentially out-of-character reasons, your character may be given a "reroll" tag on the WHO list to denote this.

The process to reroll your character is to log out of Star Conquest, log back in, and choose the "Delete Character" option. Follow the prompts, then create a new character at the main menu.

There are three reasons why a character has been deleted:

1) You have violated policy repeatedly or proven yourself unable to play the game without being a detriment to other players or the game itself.

2) You have not played the game in over six months AND had less than 1000 aggregate points.

3) You deleted the character yourself manually, for a reason mentioned above.

With none of the above being true, your character WILL exist in some fashion.

If 1) is true, your character will not be restored under any circumstances.  Depending on the situation your account may also have been banned, in which case you will no longer be eligible to play the game.

If 2) is true, then creating a new character with your old account and opening a SUPPORT ticket in order to speak to us is the correct course of action if you wish for your character to be restored.  However, if your previous character had not left cadethood or had less than 100 points, we strongly suggested that you simply use the newer character.  You may still request a restoration, though we will explain why it is not a good idea.  If you have been actively playing the game with your new character prior to the restoration request then it will be denied.

If 3) is true, there is a 48 hour 'Deleter's Remorse' grace period where you may create a new character and open a SUPPORT ticket in order to have the deleted character restored.  Beyond this point, we will NOT restore a manually 
04:00:11 deleted character.  If you create a new character and actively play the game with the new character, the grace period is rendered void. 

Be aware that the nature of the deletion will also play a part in whether the character is restored - accidentally choosing 'Delete Character' and somehow confirming twice is one thing.  Screaming over the comm that you hate everyone and are going to go help the Outsiders exterminate humanity before deleting is another.

To play a character different to your current one, you MUST delete your current character.  Multiple accounts are against policy as stated in Policy 9, and there is no need to create a new account if a CHARACTER has been deleted.  Accounts do NOT get deleted.

Occasionally you may TEMPORARILY be unable to delete your character - this will always be for a specific reason: You are in a liaison role, you are active in the middle of an ongoing plotline, you are not in a location that makes sense for a character to 'retire' from, or you have specifically requested that we make you unable to delete your character.

What will be restored along with your character?

When a character is restored, all points they had at the point of deletion will also be restored, as will any credits they had on them at that point.

However, items are usually unrecoverable and cannot be returned to you - the character will most likely be naked and have no containers.  Any clothing, books, workbenches, etc that they had are gone.  Any robots or other items will likewise be gone, as will apartments.

Starships are not immediately purged upon their destruction or the deletion of a character but ARE removed from the game world and are placed in a temporary 'limbo'. After a grace period any starship in this location will be deleted.  If the restoration of the character occurs before the next starship recycling, there is a POSSIBILITY that any ships previously owned by that player can be restored.  If it is after the starship recycling period, the character's ships will be gone forever.

This is why an idle-purged character that was relatively new will often not be restored, as without ships or items it becomes very difficult for a 'new' character to play the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

10:43:14 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

10:43:47 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

10:43:48 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

10:44:14 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

10:44:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

10:44:45 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

10:44:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

10:44:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

10:44:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

10:45:05 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

10:45:37 You pull a large lever towards you.

10:45:37 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:00:45 You say, "Makes sense."

12:00:47 You smile.

12:01:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then I went into the other one and sadly a felo had nested. I got to it just in time as they were starving so I had to take them to hyperion or I would have been back sooner. Then I decided to check on Asteria as she was asleep when I left the first time and she had awakened so I brought her."

12:01:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

19:27:39 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:27:39 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.

Subject: On my fate
Author: Constantine Stone
Posted: 20:54 25 September 2317 GST
--
Pilots,
 
I can't begin to apologize enough for how I've let you all down, but I'll make the only apology I can. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I've done to the Union, to the people I've hurt, and to the corps. I know what I've done is going to make all of your lives harder, and I would give anything to undo it.
 
That said, the government said they would press no charges against me if I agreed to uphold my pilot contract, that is, if I acknowledged that there is nothing I can do to stop Outccord, and if I agreed to work for the Union and her interests. They weren't clear about what would happen if I declined, but did say that my license would be revoked at a minimum.
 
I accepted this agreement.
 
I asked for a rough estimate of the damages I caused, and was given an estimate of 50 billion. I'm only worth 4.5, so I said I would return to work to make the victims of the tragedy whole in the only way I can. 
 
I understand that many of you are going to find my taking this deal to be disagreeable. I don't blame you for feeling this way. Part of me feels this way myself. But if I can do anything to undo the damage I've done, it's my desire and responsibility to do so.
 
 
Once I've repaid this debt, I may turn in my license with the full understanding that I'll no longer be adhering to the agreement. At that point the govern
23:03:28 ment will do whatever it wants with me.
 
Part of me had wanted to spend time on Dure learning to forgive myself and live with what I've done. As I won't be doing that in the near future, I will be taking a leave of absence. I'm going to try to get details about the crash sites from the government, and if I can, I plan to spend the next few weeks working in the damaged communities.
 
Once again, I'm sorry to have let you all down, and I do understand if the way I've chosen to deal with this makes you think less of me. I look forward to seeing you all again once I return.

23:05:55 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:05:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.

23:11:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. all this stuff has left me so broke."

23:11:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What stuff?"

23:11:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Striking, and all the credits I spent on various things."

23:12:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Folks probably don't realize it, but I've actually spent quite a few credits on various things twoards what we were doing."

23:13:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I hope all was worth it? In the end, that is.."

23:14:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Some are wondering if there is any point to this strike now... And some are wondering what your point was... with the other day. Or, what point you were trying to make?"

23:14:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, no. Especially not this most recent tragic course of action. Outccord will go through in a few days, and there's not really anything else we can do to stop it. It's inevitable now."

23:14:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... It was probably inevitable anyways, without this tragic event."

23:14:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Some are wondering if there's any point to it? Most folks seemed to understand the point of it when pilots from all alliances showed up to the protests."

23:15:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "IF the Outccord goes through... what point was there to the strike then? All it did then, is hurt our Corp."

23:16:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Best then wins.. again?"

23:16:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If it goes through, there was no point."

23:16:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hope you won't blame us for trying."

23:16:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nope."

23:16:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not us, as in Eli and I."

23:16:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Definitely blame us for what we've done."

23:16:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But a lot of people supported the strike because it seemed like our only option at the time."

23:17:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They're right. People from all alliances suported the strike."

23:17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "/WE/ need to find a solutin or put together something on our own... as civilian pilots. And maybe establish again with the Accord."

23:17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Supported."

23:17:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah..."

23:18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If Best doesn't. We should."

23:18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We can't really do it on our own. We're just civilians."

23:18:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "SO?"

23:19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We should certainly try to do as much work for them as we can though, once everyone starts back to working."

23:19:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They have the power to revoke your license and they help subcidize much of the costs of ships."

23:20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That sounds like blackmail..."

23:20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Erm.. blackmail?"

23:20:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, ""we hold power to revoke your license. Do as we say, or else..""

23:20:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We wouldn't be able to afford the cost of a starship without the subsidization."

23:21:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well yeah, the same thing goes for any exmployer."

23:21:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, ".. for any employer."

23:22:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I hope you guys will forgive me, but I took a deal offered to me by our new liaison... I don't have any fight left in me anymore anyways, not after the mistakes of the other day."

23:22:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What was the deal?"

23:22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Our new liaison is nice by the way. I actually think she will be a benefit to the corps."

23:23:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What is her name?"

23:23:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Antoinette Richard."

23:23:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wrote a bit about the deal in my post on the general board."

23:23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, Antoinette Richards."

23:23:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, I read the post. Somehow I missed the name."

23:23:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I didn't mention her in the post."

23:23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just the deal."

23:24:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Basically, I go back to work and stop trying to get people to rise up, and they don't throw me in prison and throw away the key."

23:24:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, ok."

23:24:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I did tell her, however, that I don't control what the other pilots do."

23:24:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "So are you going to take the deal too then, Eli?"

23:25:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I already did, Ather. I understand if you want to kick me out of invaders. I won't blame you at all."

23:25:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was already contemplating ending the strike regardless. We no longer really have a leg to stand on."

23:25:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, exactly."

23:25:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's all my fault... I'm sorry I let you guys down."

23:25:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's not all your fault."

23:26:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And guys, if they had let me discuss this with you, I would have."

23:26:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would have gone to Dure if everyone agreed it was best."

23:26:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I can still surrender my license."

23:26:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh..."

23:26:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Alright then.. Ather."

23:26:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Please don't surrender your license."

23:27:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like a dog taking the deal, but I don't have nearly enough money to feel that I've made the victims whole."

23:27:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "As much as I can, at any rate."

23:27:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I intend to stay on at least until I accumulate 50 billion for them."

23:29:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, please come talk to Lily and I before you surrender your license. The AEU needs good pilots. We can all help you get through this."

23:31:09 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

23:35:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Eli... I'm curious. How much do you and Stone have to pay for damages? In total."

23:38:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's one of the most accurate headlines in a while though. Half expected it ot say that I supported Outccord now or something."

23:39:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There is no point for them to mince words anymore. They won, we lost."

23:39:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "She said I just had to go back to abiding by my contract and not to encourage anymore rising up."

23:42:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You heard me AEU folks! If you haven't already, back to work."

23:42:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Constantine, send a notice stating that the strike is over."

23:43:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't make that post on the general board because I figured everyone would find the deal distasteful. However, it would answer a lot of their questions."

23:43:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

23:43:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You posted it on AEU/general, not general/general."

23:43:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm a little surprised,  but Iunderstand it. I did tell her that just because Constantine I stopped that didn't mean everyone would."

23:43:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know, but it occurred to me that everyone is going to have questions about it."

23:44:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So maybe I should have posted it on general/general."

23:44:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was thinking of calling off the strike well before your deals were presented to you both. I was talking to the other pilots about it yesterday afternoon."

23:44:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "For pretty much the reaso nI just stated on general comms."

23:45:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah. I mean we didn' tmean to hurt anyone, but honestly if that didn't have an effect, I'm not sure what in the hell would have."

23:45:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm going to do my own part to help for the recovery. Stay tuned for an announcement."

23:46:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And the damages are fifty billion."

23:46:36 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

23:46:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Some good news at least, she said that the injured will be patched up in no time and that it will be paid for by Garner Care."

23:46:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather, I would like to make sure I pay my full share of the damages."

23:47:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If that means paying you back for money you give, I'd still like to."

23:47:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. I can't even afford a transport."

23:48:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can front you the money, Eli."

23:48:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nah constantine, you've done enough for me already and all it's done is caused you strife. I'll be alright."
