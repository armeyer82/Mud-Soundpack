-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a large periwinkle bed pillow here.
You can go out.

19:51 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

19:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Observation Deck]

19:51 You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing violet and white aquatic life and coral rocks, a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, and Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

19:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]

19:51 You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, and a small purple trash bin here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

19:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a small dusky pink trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

19:51 You can't go that way.

19:51 I can't find "sofa."

19:51 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

19:51 I don't understand that.

19:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

19:55 New Minor Changes:

19:55 
-----
LOAD and UNLOAD commands on landing pads have been added to manually load and unload battlesuits. The ship must be present on the pad, though ships in another ship's docking bay will also be found. Manually loaded battlesuits must be manually unloaded later; they will not automatically transfer, which would rather defeat the purpose.

You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

23:04  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a stormy pair of trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

23:04 You are carrying nothing.

23:04 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

23:04 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Can you bring a rep suit."

23:04 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So am i."

23:04 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "One of you damage as well then? I have the league."

23:05 [Tactical Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I will be shortly as well. I can bring a low-tier AEU suit or an EAOS, as needed."

23:05 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "How many!"

23:05 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I can bring EAU 5 or EAOS 4."

23:05 [Tactical Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Although if you'd like the final spot to go to someone with higher than tier 1 I'll certainly understand."

23:05 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "I've only got a tier 2."

23:05 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ideally 4 or 5."

23:06 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Suits that is."

23:06 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Tiers don't matter too much on the frontier processor."

23:06 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just don't take more than four folks."

23:06 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I wasn't referring to tiers."

23:06 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "I was addressing, Shule Lily. But if tiers don't matter than bring whatever you like."

23:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was answering -their- question."

23:07 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Should I bring my EAOs or my EAU?"

23:07 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "AEU."

23:07 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

23:07 You scramble to your feet.

23:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

You can go up and out.

23:07 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:07 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "And what would you prefer I bring?"

23:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:08 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Alright I'll be over on New Earth."

23:08 The ship is already moving.

23:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:08 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:08 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:08 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:08 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:08 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:08 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Something Damage Lily."

23:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:08 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Fearless! Welcome to home space!"

23:08 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 298" has docked with Space Station Alpha.

23:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fearless. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:13 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

23:13 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

23:13 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:13 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Then let clari come along."

23:13 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

23:14 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Casen why don't you bring your AEU and just help out with repairs a bit as I think you may run out of energy often without an energy regeneration mod."

23:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Certainly."

23:14 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "But hey! If you want to try go for it."

23:15 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the scout "Brook" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

23:15 You grin.

23:15 Casen Thale just arrived.

23:15 Lily Kaise waves and smiles.

23:15 You smile at Casen Thale.

23:15 You say to Casen Thale, "Hi!"

23:15 Lily says to Casen Thale, "Hey!"

23:15 Casen Thale says, "Good evening, you two. I'm excited that we'll be clearing the vents out."

23:15 Lily Kaise grins.

23:15 You grin at Casen Thale.

23:16 You chuckle. "Well, the vents aren't really that pretty to be in."

23:16 Lily Kaise says, "I've taken lots of folks before so yes pay out is rather poor but it's the benefit of using the Processor which is the most important and hopefully just trying our best to keep plugging on this project."

23:16 You nod to Lily Kaise.

23:17 Casen nods. "Truthfully the payoff of being able to use the processor is primarily what I'm after," she says. "That and the sense of keeping the Bari under control rather than just letting it all run rampant, I suppose."

23:17 Lily Kaise says, "Although tier isn't that important. It is said that one of these days the queen will emerge and that will be rather... challenging."

23:19 You nod to Casen Thale.

23:19 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Okay just us four."

23:19 Casen Thale says, "While we're waiting on Hawthorn I'm going to take a look at the EAOS suit and make sure it's ready. If he strongly prefers one way or the other I'd just as soon be prepared."

23:19 Casen Thale walks out.

23:19 Lily says to an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, "Casen, this is probably the last Vent cleansing we'll do for awhile. I guess you have heard about an expedition leaving tomorrow. We'll be gone for a few weeks. Is there anything we can do for you before we depart which will help you along?"

23:19 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:19 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

23:19 You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by loud swearing.

23:19 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person Accord gemini "Battlesuits Not Birthday Suits" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

23:20 Hawthorn Dunn just arrived.

23:20 You wave.

23:20 Hawthorn Dunn waves.

23:20 Lily Kaise waves.

23:20 Lily Kaise asks, "I hope Clari is coming?"

23:20 Hawthorn Dunn says, "She's not."

23:20 Lily Kaise sighs.

23:20 You say, "Oh dear, this could take a while."

23:20 Lily Kaise says, "Wellwe'll have an issue."

23:21 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah because I would be the only damage suit."

23:21 You nod to Lily Kaise.

23:21 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Casen is bringing eaos."

23:21 Lily Kaise says, "Yes but she is like a tier 1."

23:21 Casen Thale just arrived.

23:21 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I was under the impression that tier wasn't an issue."

23:21 Lily Kaise says, "It should be at least a 3."

23:21 You say, "She's going to go through energy like my ex's used to go through boyfriends. I mean..."

23:21 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Can we put her in AEu and you both bring damage?"

23:22 Lily says to Casen Thale, "What is your tier for aEU?"

23:22 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh, hey there. Didn't see you come in."

23:22 Casen Thale says, "One. I'm about forty points from 1.5. Presently I only have regeneration and minor repars, as far as all that goes."

23:22 A nearby pilot lectures at length about why having diplomatic relations with other alliances is stupid.

23:22 "Hello.'" Casen Thale smiles at Hawthorn Dunn.

23:22 Lily says to Hawthorn, "Please ask Clari to come unless she just isn't available?"

23:23 Hawthorn Dunn says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Hey Clarina, they're saying they still need you, because they need more firepower. If it's no. We can regroup when they have more available."

23:23 You say, "I can switch back to EAOs."

23:23 Lily says to Hawthorn, "I've led many of these and so I agree that ideally 4 is good but 5 is fine."

23:23 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I don't want to spend two hours on this honestly."

23:23 Lily Kaise says, "Me either so please ask Clari."

23:23 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I did."

23:24 Hawthorn Dunn says, "If she can't come. We'll regroup when there is a better line up of suits."

23:24 Lily says to Casen, "What tier is your AEU?"

23:24 Lily Kaise smiles.

23:24 Hawthorn Dunn says, "She said one."

23:24 You say to Lily, "Think she said 1."

23:24 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

23:24 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Regen and minor repairs."

23:24 You nod.

23:24 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that's pretty tough."

23:25 Lily Kaise says, "Sometimes you need more than minor rep."

23:25 Casen Thale says, "I'll be 1.5 sooner or later, but coming by ground points is a bit more difficult than the others, I've found."

23:25 You say, "AEu should be at least tier 3 in my opinion."

23:25 Lily Kaise nods and smiles.

23:25 Lily Kaise nods to you.

23:25 You say, "And yeah, I don't have two hours I can spend on this."

23:26 Lily Kaise says, "I like bringing a newer pilot along on these for the experience and then 4 other good suits so Ather isn't taking certain things into consideration."

23:26 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Alright we'll try again later then she's not available."

23:26 Lily Kaise says, "Sec."

23:26 You say, "And like I said, EAOS tier 1 and 2 are going to go through energy like my ex's went through boyfriends."

23:26 A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.

23:26 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Damien Alexander where are you?"

23:27 Lily Kaise says, "I just love to hate buttons."

23:27 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Chuckle lily 'Don't think he can hear us on this channel."

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Oh dear. Is that his full name?"

23:27 I don't understand that.

23:27 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "He is in big trouble."

23:27 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Chuckle'i just love to hate buttons."

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Buttons are hard."

23:28 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:28 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Damien Alexander are you available?"

23:28 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah, you doing the processor?"

23:28 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Indeed."

23:28 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:28 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes sir. Please bring some kind of plasma thrower."

23:28 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:28 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Junkbot okay?"

23:28 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Or rats would work too."

23:28 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:28 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sure."

23:28 Casen Thale asks, "I'll swtich to the AEU, then?"

23:28 You nod to Casen Thale.

23:29 You say to Casen, "Please do."

23:29 Lily says to Casen, "Sure."

23:29 Casen takes a step back, flashing Hawthorn a smile. "There is yet hope," she says, before turning for the door.

23:29 Casen Thale walks out.

23:29 You say, "This is going to be interesting."

23:29 You grin.

23:29 Hawthorn nods then crosses his arms over his chest with a shrug of shoulders. "I hope we can get through this fast."

23:30 Lily Kaise says, "Naa it will be fine now."

23:30 You nod to Hawthorn Dunn.

23:30 Lily Kaise says, "Damien has done plent of these."

23:30 You say, "Yep, he has."

23:30 You say to Lily, "Actually, you, me and him have done quite a few of these."

23:31 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

23:31 Casen Thale just arrived.

23:31 Lily Kaise says, "I miss my league but you know I did fine in the Monk last time."

23:31 You nod to Lily Kaise. "You did fine."

23:31 You smile at Casen Thale.

23:31 You say to Casen Thale, "Welcome back."

23:31 Lily Kaise gives Casen Thale some credits.

23:32 Lily says to Casen Thale, "There a little payola."

23:32 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:32 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

23:32 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm actually am surprised you guys need me. With ather you guys and Constantine it should be easy to do this."

23:32 Casen Thale says, "Oh! Well. Thank you."

23:32 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok so whose Mule?"

23:32 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Er, am surprised."

23:32 Hawthorn Dunn says, "It has to be one of yours apparently."

23:32 Lily Kaise says, "Ather isn't always available."

23:33 Lily Kaise says, "Constantine wants to do these when Shule and I are about to crash for the day."

23:33 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:33 You nod and chuckle.

23:33 You ask, "Ok, so whose mule?"

23:33 Lily Kaise says, "So we'll take our org's mule."

23:33 You say, "Ok."

23:33 You say, "Sounds like a plan to me."

23:34 Lily Kaise says, "Sec."

23:34 Lily Kaise just went into back stairway to the garage.

23:35 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Sadly I was hoping to be on the station already how long is this gonna be I don't want to run out of time."

23:35 Hawthorn Dunn blinks.

23:35 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I...am just rambling on and on. ugh."

23:35 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person Accord gemini "Tlapaloa" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

23:35 Damien Alexander just arrived.

23:35 A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.

23:35 You say, "It can take 5 minutes or it can take an hour and a half. IT really depends."

23:35 You wave to Damien Alexander.

23:35 Damien Alexander waves.

23:36 Damien Alexander orders a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

23:36 "That much variance?" Casen asks you quizzically, lifting a hand to welcome Damien.

23:36 Damien Alexander takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

23:36 You nod to Casen Thale.

23:36 Damien chews happily, waving back to Casen.

23:36 You say to Casen, "Sometimes we can find the exit in the next room or it can be the last room deep in the section of the vents."

23:37 Damien Alexander absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:37 Hawthorn Dunn says, "...well, that's not good for me. I'm pretty serious about this cut off thing I have about half an hour at most."

23:37 Lily Kaise just arrived.

23:37 You say, "Oh dear."

23:37 You say, "We can't promise a half an hour."

23:37 Damien Alexander waves to Lily Kaise.

23:37 You frown.

23:37 Lily Kaise asks, "What's wrong?"

23:37 Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.

23:37 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I only have like half an hour. I didn't know it could be longer than that."

23:37 Damien Alexander takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

23:38 Lily Kaise says, "Well hmm I can switch to my monk and take over if you have to leave."

23:39 Lily Kaise asks, "So want to try that Hawthorn?"

23:39 Hawthorn Dunn says, "If you have the monk can you do that and take damien in my place? I don't tink it's gonna be good if I am too long out. Ugh."

23:40 Lily Kaise says, "Well we still need two damage suits."

23:40 Damien Alexander takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

23:40 Hawthorn Dunn says, "With the high tiers and te Junkbot you have enough repairs. Too along wit hdamage."

23:40 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

23:40 Lily Kaise glides out.

23:40 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Switch Shule to EAOS and put CAsen in AEU."

23:40 Hawthorn rubs his face.

23:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm going to switch to EAOs."

23:41 Hawthorn Dunn exclaims, "There we go!"

23:47 You disband your group.

23:47 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Conjurer from storage and sets it in front of you.

23:47 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceiling, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

23:47 Casen Thale asks, "So there aren't any defenses around the entrance to the vents like on the megapods or a nest, then?"

23:47 Damien Alexander presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves a Mutuality Junkbot from storage and sets it in front of him.

23:47 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceiling, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

23:48 You shake your head at Casen Thale.

23:48 Damien Alexander presses a button on a Mutuality Junkbot, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceiling, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

23:48 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Sun Fish."

23:48 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

23:48 You speak into the microphone.

23:48 Casen Thale presses a button on an AEU Light Combatant, which splits open down the front. She carefully climbs inside.

23:49 You speak into the microphone.

23:49 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

23:49 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

23:49 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

23:49 You can't do that right now.

23:49 You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

23:49 You say, "See you all down there."

23:49 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

23:49 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

23:49 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

23:49 (20 seconds roundtime.)

23:50 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

23:50 (20 seconds roundtime.)

23:50 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

23:50 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You can go west.

23:50 
[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins -- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You see Bari Mold Alpha here.
