Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk
sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower
quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, and a dark violet fabric loveseat here.
You can go out.

Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene
to formless mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.

[Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Control Room]
A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off
on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky
from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains
of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a dark violet
fabric armchair, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a black

You can go south and out.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
Keegan Wantz says, "Hmm."
Keegan Wantz says, "Making reasonably okay time, whew."

A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to
swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of
brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked,
"GO!"
Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "ZAP."
Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the
entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
Alko Delovega says into the PA microphone, "Iww."
Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow throw a tantrum now wont you!"
Lily Kaise laughs.

Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Woo up to 51 on NDB and 85 on the
Long-Range NDB."
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the
drain, obscuring your vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Lily Kaise says, "Eek."
The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
Lily Kaise says, "Zap goes the Rift Drive."
A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in,
obscuring your vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding
you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through
billowing clouds.
Lily Kaise says, "Be right back as I need to feed a ittle izie."
Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed black sofa.
Lily Kaise glides south.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally just shifting mists.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb
slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.
Lily Kaise glides in from the south.
Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed black sofa.
Lily Kaise carefully buckles her seatbelt.
Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail
curled loosely around her.
The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening,
and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing
that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless
desert plain is all around.
Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.
The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to
mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
Alko Delovega says into the PA microphone, "Lovely speed."
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
Alko Delovega says into the PA microphone, "Calling us names now?"
Keegan Wantz says, "Oh, Lily."
Keegan Wantz says, "Keep Asteria on the main ship while we undock the seers I
think."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "NO. Just you specifically."
Keegan Wantz says, "Just in case the sightseers have no power when we undock."
Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "52%!"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
Lily Kaise says to Keegan, "Yeah I definitley will as she seemed to wander off
last when we docked."
Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "It was actually worse than that but it's at least
resolved."
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as
one, finding a new updraft.
The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch
on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed black sofa.
Lily Kaise glides south.
Lily Kaise glides in from the south.
Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed black sofa.
Lily Kaise carefully buckles her seatbelt.
Lily Kaise says, "Drive still holding up."
A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through
into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place
isn't right.
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly
emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the
dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.

You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch
on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the

Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Lily Kaise says, "But yeah not likely it will and we'll likely have to repair at
least a couple more times."
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades

Keegan Wantz says, "Ooer."

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,

The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat

the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
Lily Kaise slides a "Happy" key off of an enameled purple space cat keyring.
The horses cease their panic, and breathe hard as they resume a more normal

A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been

world.
Lily Kaise says, "Just in case I am not coherent enough when you have to undock

The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,

Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien

the ship.

[Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Remember what I said.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
The neon green plastic plant slowly undulates.
The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.
The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and
closing. It then abruptly swims off.
Multicolored fish flakes drop from above and float on the surface. The fish
eagerly gobble them up.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the
drain, obscuring your vision.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the

Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene
to formless mist.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship
becomes more noticeable.

A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

Terrible things. They want to do terrible things.
Remember what I said.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.
