Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a
small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a
robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

Lily Kaise says, "I'm beginning to wonder if the scandal he and Evenia has
caused has gotten to his conscience."
Lily Kaise says, "Which in all fairness, isn't truly his fault I just believe

I'm the best for the position.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

tra 1 I mean, think about it. Even on the clipper, there's a 15 percent bonus.
Figure out how much damage that equates to.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I mean, think about
it. Even on the clipper, there's a 15 percent bonus. Figure out how much damage
that equates to."
With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.
tra 1 With all 12 lasers having that bonus.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "With all 12 lasers
having that bonus."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's 2 extra
damage per turret."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, assuming
you use the 15 damage lasers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also, even with
a good engineer you'll be waiting on the grid in the clipper, reducing its
overall speed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "However, it can
really clear a fighter quickly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And that's
something."
tra 1 Well, at the same time, the clipper can get away really fast. So, it's
kind of a hit and run ship. It has the power to break failsafes and then run
off.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, at the same
time, the clipper can get away really fast. So, it's kind of a hit and run ship.
It has the power to break failsafes and then run off."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I mean
that's the real trick. Our ships are set up in specific ways to be good at
specific things."
tra 1 Whereas the cruiser is just built for power.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Whereas the cruiser
is just built for power."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In practice a
lot of us probably don't use them for those things often, just because we don't
see the situations come up."
tra 1 Right. One has to keep in mind that many of our ships are meant to be
support ships. So, if you get a clipper in there to just break failsafes and
then have someone else's ship beat the living  daylights out of the  enemy. It
makes more sense. Even having a cruiser there is a formidable combination.

tra 1 Some of our ships get engine boosts for that exact reason.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Some of our ships
get engine boosts for that exact reason."
tra 1 In fact, Ather often jumps in with his clipper to just launch bolts at the
enemy.

catching his ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it would
be good for that."
tra 1 Hence why I like AEU pilots to learn how to fly from other AEU pilots. At
least learn a few things from AEU pilots. Other alliance ships are set up
differently and so things have to be taken into consideration. A league ship is
designed to take a lot more damage than our ships, but our ships get engine
boosts.

Lily,
I spoke to Kim earlier about providing a few slow burning fusion things. With
the new thermal reclamation modules, we can get the small beacon stations (776,
286) to last just over two months if we put them on the slow burners. When I
spoke to her, she wasn't sure you'd want to spend the megacredits. Your cost
(for those two) would come out to 6 megacredits per month. She went ahead and
put three with just Starseekers in her warehouse. If you don't mind her spending
vassal megacredits, can you write to her and let her know? I didn't figure you
would mind since you're wanting to help out, but she didn't want to spend it
without your goahead. Anyway, I have enough for a couple months, plus one of the
stations for longer, so you've got time to think about it if necessary.
Thanks,
Morris

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
