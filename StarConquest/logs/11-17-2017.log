03:56 I can't find "chair."

03:56 I don't understand that.

03:56 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

03:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

04:15 You activate the long-range scanner and search for passive detections and recent ping returns.

Targets detected passively or via active ping returns:
   A miniscule energy signature presently detected 31.1 light-hours toward Galactic East and Very Slightly Down

   A miniscule energy signature presently detected 75.78 light-hours toward Galactic Northwest and Down
   A miniscule energy signature presently detected 8.91 light-minutes toward Galactic West
   A small energy signature presently detected 8.91 light-minutes toward Galactic West
   A miniscule energy signature presently detected 8.91 light-minutes toward Galactic West

04:16 The ship is not moving.

04:16 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 275."

04:16 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:16 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:16 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

04:16 The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:16 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

04:16 Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

04:16 AutoStar detects 34 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

04:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:17 You begin the docking sequence.

04:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

04:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:13 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

05:33 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]

05:33 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.

I just saw a QI clan ship firing on one of our ships, which had launched to try to leave the sector. The ship then kept still and has been destroyed. I was going out to protect it but I was too late. This is the second time they have shot first on one of our ships this afternoon, so we might need to think about our tactics.

Tactics should be for people to be smart and get the hell out of the sector. I landed when they fired at me to get a combat ship but they took off before I could go engage.

We tried everything we could think of, but we couldn't find a way to rescue Constantine from his rescue pod, so he will be going back to New Earth in it once the interdiction is lifted.

Tobias and I cleared the sector so that Constantine's pod can get home. Just be on the watch and try to be safe. Please for all that's sanity, do not sit still in a sector with these guys.

It's unfortunate what happened here, but as Mel said I think the lesson is clear.
Be on the lookout. Run up into the control room of the station and check things out before you launch. And for the sake of sanity, don't sit still.

Hello all. Sad news to report. Nissi launched and got interdicted in her siteseer and got blown up.

Just before she left I discussed making a brief side-trip to Feng Wo before heading home, and she agreed to take us there. If one of the other charters is amenable, I would still like to proceed as several people, myself included have not been there yet, and we are rather close.

Please respond on the board or let me know before our departure on Saturday at 23:59.

thanks,
Johann Schraft

Hello:
As one of the available charters, I personally intend to go home. If another charter is available to take you to Feng Wo, then I can pod home if necessary, but otherwise I'm down to go home with you all tomorrow at 23:59.

correct me if I'mw rong, but are we not close enough that we could do it with a simple heading? If so, perhaps a charter could simply get us the heading before heading home. 
I believe i was told it was merely a day away from here, that could be made easily with just one chart from this location I would think

New information has come to us from home. Nissi is back and capsuling out. She hopes to make it before departure, but if she does not, we will delay departure until she gets here. Please have your ships docked by our departure time because we will leave as soon as she arives and I don't want to rangle people up from all over the field.
Thanks,
Johann
