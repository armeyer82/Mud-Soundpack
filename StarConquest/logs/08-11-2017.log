00:07:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Shule, constantine, when you get a chance, stop by the New Earth pad please. Just knock on Grey sky."

00:10:48 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I will ask. However, the position stated was a Mutuality ship will take you to the meeting."

00:11:01 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I have offered to be the ferry."

00:11:59 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Lordy, The Rocks!". The organization has earned 950,964.10 credits.

00:13:07 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:13:08 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:13:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:13:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:13:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:13:16 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Aisling, it looks like I'm the delegation."

00:13:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:13:25 I don't understand that.

00:13:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:13:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:13:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm ready to go whenever you are available to take me."

00:13:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:13:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:13:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:13:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:13:35 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:13:46 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "A time frame is required."

00:13:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:13:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

00:14:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:14:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:14:12 I don't understand that.

00:14:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:14:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:14:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:14:26 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:14:26 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:14:27 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

00:14:27 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:14:27 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The four-person light carrier "On The Wings Of A Hummingbird", the two-person medium transport "Grey Sky", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
Constantine Stone and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey are standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

00:14:34 You wave to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

00:14:36 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It's possible you will not be able to."

00:14:39 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey waves to you.

00:14:41 Constantine Stone nods.

00:14:41 You say to Eli, "Hi!"

00:14:49 Eli nods sadly to you.

00:14:54 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gives you a letter.

00:14:56 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

00:14:57 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:14:58 You say, "Ok."

00:15:00 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey removes a letter from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

00:15:03 --

00:15:03 Please have your transports in orbit as the broadcast begins. I will be on board my transport with a portable holocamera
say i will give an intersector transmission to start the countdown, I will time the start of my countdown so that the camera will pick up your transports exploding before mine finally goes as well
say It may be wise, to quickly use the destination command in the pod, to divert your pods elsewhere, I will be diverting mine to the torus. If you wish you may have a friend pick you up in another ship via spacewalk if you prefer to do that
say I will try to time it so that the broadcast will end shortly after the detonation

00:15:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Will that work?"

00:15:16 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

00:15:16 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods north.

00:15:18 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

00:15:20 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

00:15:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Excellent."

00:15:30 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

00:15:31 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unfortunately, I think I can only do it right now. It will have to wait until more AEU pilots return from expeditions, I'm sorry to say."

00:15:53 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

00:15:54 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If I'm wrong, I'll let you know tomorrow."

00:16:10 You ask, "Is that all?"

00:16:14 You crumple up a letter and throw it in a nearby garbage can.

00:16:16 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods north.

00:16:16 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

00:16:20 Eli says to you, "Yeah that's all."

00:16:23 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Okay. The Council needs more preparation to meet you than "now." Plus Ninth Fleet wishes to listen."

00:16:23 You say, "Ok."

00:16:27 You wave.

00:16:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Sorry, I'm still trying to get my head straight."

00:16:35 You say, "It's ok."

00:16:49 You wave.

00:16:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey waves.

00:16:52 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

00:16:52 You can go up.

00:16:54 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

00:16:55 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:16:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:16:55 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:16:56 Board what?

00:16:58 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I didn't realize this. I get it, but I probably just can't be part of the meeting, then. I'll ask Vernos to set something up with someone else, or if I'm still available tomorrow, I'll set something up."

00:16:59 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry!"

00:17:01 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:17:01 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:17:02 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "This is not a meeting with me. This is a meeting directly with Council."

00:17:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:17:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:17:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:17:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

00:17:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

00:17:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:18:15 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I am wondering. Would it be wise for me to perhaps send a qe. Requesting that Johann's expedition returns home?"

00:18:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:18:19 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:18:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:18:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:18:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:18:34 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think that will be necessary. At least three AEU pilots should be back in a day or two."

00:18:39 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:18:40 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Eh."

00:18:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:18:43 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:19:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I realize this. But I feel like it's important that pilots are home, not...exploring right now."

00:19:14 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:22:16 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

00:23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, this is too bad. I feel like no negotiations will succeed now."

00:23:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe in a month or two we can try."

00:23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What happened?"

00:24:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nothing, I just didn't realize they wouldn't be able to meet on short notice."

00:24:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which was stupid of me."

00:24:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I can't meet with them today."

00:24:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The treaty has already expired. It's important, but we can still do it later. The fact they are still willing to meet with us at all is a blessing."

00:25:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you're right."

00:36:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can't remove plants from ships, can you?"

00:37:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The repair shop can do a duct purge."

00:37:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Does that destroy the plant entirely?"

00:37:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But it destroys the plant if that's what you are wondering."

00:37:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

00:37:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Poor plant."

00:38:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can help you buy a new one, if you ended up needing to do such a thing."

00:38:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, it's not the money."

01:27:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

01:38:05 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:38:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:47:41 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

01:48:05 You peer out...

01:48:05 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The two-person medium transport "Kalliste", the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 226", and the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 390" are landed here.

01:58:29 You remove a metallic gold touch einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

01:58:29 You tap at your metallic gold touch einrophone and a tiny holoemitter comes to life.
From a phone-based holoemitter: A floating Public Access logo appears next to the words "Public Access HV."

01:58:36 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey turns to the camera, eyes rimmed in red. "Greetings once again citizens of the Union, and of the galaxy."

01:58:36 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli is plain and has a slightly pudgy build, fair skin, grey eyes, and mid-back length mirror finish chrome hair and he stands about five feet and ten inches tall and looks to be in his late twenties. He is wearing a long white coat, a long-sleeved shirt of steel gray synthcotton, a pair of close-fitting steel gray synthcotton pants, and a pair of black synthleather ship boots.

01:59:09 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Tonights broadcast will be a little different, as you can see. We are abord my transport Grey Sky."

01:59:35 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli gestures at the planet of New earth, visible through the viewport.

02:01:08 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I almost thought of calling off this broadcast tonight, after the tragic events of today. There are some that may say that I should have. Make no mistake, that we do what we do tonight, with a heavy heart indeed."

02:01:25 You notice that your hair is now mid-back length.

02:02:40 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The tragic bombing of my hometown, is something that will be forever burned into my memory. Those that have done this terrible thing, have done so out of desperation. A desperation that so many of us have felt lately. I do not condone their actions, but I understand them."

02:03:23 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I have decided to move forward, with something we have been planning for oever a week now, in the hopes that it will prevent others from feeling that they need to act in similar ways."

02:03:23 From a phone-based holoemitter: You hear Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's metallic silver touch einrophone ringing.

02:03:26 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Debate.

02:03:28 From a phone-based holoemitter: You hear Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's metallic silver touch einrophone ringing.

02:03:33 From a phone-based holoemitter: You hear Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's metallic silver touch einrophone ringing.

02:03:36 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey puts a metallic silver touch einrophone in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:04:01 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eli is doing a broadcast, you idiots!"

02:05:11 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "We have spoken at length, about the importance of remaining in the Accord. Something that many of us fear will lead to total disaster. Our words have not changed anything, however and so it is time that instead, we act."

02:05:22 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I have more important things to send along."

02:05:35 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances down at his gleaming silver pocket watch momentarily.

02:06:04 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Watch superbroadcast and stand by."

02:06:04 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I hope that what we do here, will make you all see the seriousness of what we have said in previous weeks."

02:07:20 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "We have attempted to use reason to reach our government. And instead of responding with their own logical arguments, they have chosen instead to drag our names through the mud, and to use deception and manipulation against what we have to say."

02:08:44 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "This transport, the Grey sky, has survived many things. Outsiders, IFS, pirates. She has travelled into deep space to bring home valuable resources for the alliance. She even once assisted in relieve a drought on the planet of Hyperion."

02:08:48 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Procrastination" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

Procrastination.........................(20, 20, 20)
Dalmatian Pelican.......................(19, 10, 5)
Grey Sky................................(19, 5, 5)

02:09:54 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "None of that will matter though, if the Accord is weakened. If the Union pulls itself into a shell, no amount of resources will save her, or humanity."

02:10:25 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances down at his gleaming silver pocket watch momentarily.

02:12:32 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli take a deep breath, and lets it out slowly, the ripples on his skin gorwing slower as he speaks. "I am, truthfully at a loss for what else to say. I can only hope that by doing what we will do tonight, will be the start to ending all of this madness.

02:14:29 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "And so, it is with htis, that we call for a resource strike. We call for all Union pilots to join us in this. We shall continue to divert patrols, keep space clear of RATS and their nests, and defend against all threats, but we will no longer bring resoruces in. We can not fund an alliance in it's endeavor to destroy itself."

02:14:44 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances down at his gleaming silver pocket watch momentarily.

02:18:48 You suddenly float up into the air as the ship's artificial gravity abruptly switches off, and you feel your hair stand on end as the ship projects an electromagnetic field around you. Suddenly, every seam of the ship seems to come apart, exposing you to space. You quickly close your eyes as the vacuum pulls at your skin and the electromagnetic field tugs you rapidly toward a starship rescue pod.
[Kalliste Rescue Pod]
You can go nowhere.
The pod simply drifts for a moment as its automatic navigation systems come online. Then it smoothly maneuvers through the wreckage of the starship and out into open space.

02:18:49 You bring up a tiny screen of flight controls with a mere handful of selections on it.

Please choose a destination:

[1] 0
[2] The Torus
[3] New Earth
[4] Old Earth
[5] Chetumal
[6] Space Station "Helios"

02:18:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:19:00 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:19:24 [Kalliste Rescue Pod]

02:19:24 This pod is rather cramped quarters, consisting of a circle of seats with harnesses to secure the occupants. Space is saved by the almost total lack of any sort of flight control whatsoever, although a tiny starmap display and a very few other status readouts are available. Equipment thrums under your feet, where the flight computer and the pod's various drives are housed. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a "Kalliste" salvage container here.
You can go nowhere.

02:19:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:19:29 The ship rapidly heads toward a planet.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:19:37 You peer out...

02:19:37 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The Kalliste rescue pod is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

02:19:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:19:39 Rescue workers quickly empty the landed rescue pod.

02:19:41 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

02:19:41 The Kalliste rescue pod is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
Spaceport workers efficiently haul the spent pod out of the way.

02:19:41 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

02:19:42 You see a large number of stored starships here.
You see a sanitation drone here.
You can go up.

02:20:09 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to battlesuit storage aboard this ship.

02:20:10 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

02:20:10 You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of projectile boost here.
You can go up and out.

02:20:11 I don't understand that.

02:20:12 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

02:20:13 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:20:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:20:14 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:20:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:20:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:20:29 The ship is already moving.

02:20:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:20:32 Which sector did you mean?

02:20:33 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:20:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:20:34 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

02:20:37 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:20:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:20:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:20:40 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:20:41 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

02:20:41 From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey presses something on a portable tridimensional holocamera, and a small red light goes out.

02:20:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:20:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:20:45 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:20:48 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Fearless! Welcome to The Torus!"

02:20:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:21:18 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Rest in peace, Pelican."

02:21:20 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Well, that was an interesting waste of capital."

02:21:29 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The universe seems less salvageable without you."

02:21:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:21:30 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:21:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Fearless. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:21:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:21:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:21:47 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:21:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:21:50 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:39:18     * Welcome to Star Conquest! *

02:39:18 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]
The scent of wild roses suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the rose-tinted windows flanked by sheer gold curtains, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, a cedar dresser, a set of funky asymmetrical shelves, a plaid button down shirt, a pair of cotton briefs, a pair of black corduroy jeans, and a large bureau here.

02:40:08 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

02:40:20 You kiss Lileah Rose.

02:40:23 You see nothing special.

02:40:24 It is open.

02:40:26 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

02:40:32 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

02:40:36 I see no "messengert" here.

02:41:36 You remove a plaid button down shirt from a backpack.

02:41:41 You put a plaid button down shirt in a backpack.

02:41:43 Lileah Rose grins at you.

02:41:52 I see no "gray" in a leather briefcase.

02:41:57 You remove a grey vee-neck shirt from a leather briefcase.

02:42:00 You pull a grey vee-neck shirt on over your head.

02:42:04 You remove some black leather boots from a leather briefcase.

02:42:07 You put some black leather boots on your feet.

02:42:08 Lileah Rose points at a large bureau.

02:42:10 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

02:42:14 You say, "oh"

02:42:15 Lileah Rose says, "wrap rolan"

02:42:18 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

02:42:19 You smile at Lileah Rose.

02:42:20 Lileah Rose laughs.

02:42:22 I see no "bureah" here.

02:42:26 You see nothing special.

02:42:26 It is closed.
Lileah Rose smiles at you.

02:42:30 You open a large bureau.

02:42:35 You see nothing special.

02:42:35 It is open.
It is empty.

02:42:38 You smile.

02:42:45 Lileah Rose exclaims, "that was heavy Love! I hope it will work for the time-being!"

02:43:03 You say, "Awww, thanks. I could have helped you if I was awake"

02:43:10 You remove a pair of blue jeans from a leather briefcase.

02:43:19 Lileah Rose exclaims, "you know me, I'm impatient!"

02:43:21 Lileah Rose laughs.

02:43:35 You laugh.

02:43:39 You'll need to remove a pair of black corduroy jeans first.

02:43:46 You put a pair of blue jeans in a large bureau.

02:43:50 Close what?

02:43:53 Close what?

02:43:56 You close a large bureau.

02:43:59 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

02:44:11 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

02:44:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I tried to tell him that, Ash. He didn't seem to get that the treaty had already expired, even though he said he did."

02:44:27 Lileah Rose says, "oh I found some nice spacesuits and"

02:44:31 Lileah Rose points at a small palm-size shimmering chrome and metallic green personal lore computer.

02:44:38 You grin.

02:44:40 Lileah Rose exclaims, "this thing is amazing!"

02:44:41 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Well it will not happen."

02:44:41 You exclaim, "Oh woow!"

02:44:47 You grin.

02:44:51 Lileah Rose asks, "want to go get one for you?"

02:45:11 Lileah Rose says, "I also put some nice touches on this ship"

02:45:23 You ask, "Sure, are they expensive?"

02:45:45 Lileah Rose points to the starmap viewer

02:57:25 [Ameliorate Space Center; Main Deck; Outside Astral Accents Kiosk]

02:57:26 The main deck of the Ameliorate Space Center is constructed in the style of a massive open air bazaar with kiosks scattered across the open floor rather than enclosed structures or rooms. The entire deck is built within a massive transparisteel bubble in the heart of the space station, suspended in the midst of clear deep blue water supporting an amazing coral reef habitat. The domed roof and arching walls curve seamlessly into the transparent floor, lending a feeling of total submersion to visitors. A bewildering variety of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods immerse themselves in a dazzling array of ocean flora while the sleek and fleeting forms of sharks glide through the expanses of open water around you. The deck appears to be lit by brilliant light globes in the outer skin of the station which results in rippling blue light flooding the enclosure. A variety of potted ferns and flowering plants bathed beneath small individual sun lamps are scattered around the deck creating clear islands of light. Park-style benches can also be spotted around the deck.

03:00:50 You sit down on a lavender tapestry sectional sofa.

03:00:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Blueberry, you have clearance to undock.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:00:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:01:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:01:05 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:01:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

03:01:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:01:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:01:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:01:19 You say to Lileah Rose, "So, can I send you sexy notes or love letters via the lore computers?"

03:01:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We called for an industry strike Vernos. Destructed our transports over new earth. I hope you will join us in the strike."

03:01:49 You say to Lileah Rose, "So, can I send you sexy notes or love letters via the lore computers?"

03:01:50 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:01:53 You notice Lileah Rose using the radio to ask for landing clearance.

03:01:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Blueberry.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land."

03:01:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:02:06 Lileah Rose says to you, "sure! why not?"

03:02:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:02:09 Lileah Rose giggles quietly.

03:02:12 Lileah Rose stands up.

03:02:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'm a bit lacking in the credits department."

04:08:59 [Starship "Blueberry"; Control Room]

04:08:59 A floor lamp is casting a bright halo of light here.  The scent of wild roses suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the rose-tinted windows flanked by sheer gold curtains, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an AutoVector navigation unit, an oriental rug, a lavender tapestry sectional sofa, a glass coffee table, a small trash can, a Galactic map unit, a sector debris scanner, a starship simulator, a Galactic anomaly recording unit, a Galactic navigation unit, a silver espresso machine, a planetary system surveying unit, a temporary structure launcher, a bottle of fine white wine, a bottle of fine white wine, a large beanbag chair, a floor lamp, Higgins the droid, Daizey the droid, an advanced FTL drive tracer, an internal stun turret, and a plastic cooler here.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go southwest and down.
(You are sitting on a lavender tapestry sectional sofa.)

04:12:11 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

04:13:23 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

04:15:07 Lileah Rose makes a selection on the brightly-lit display of a small palm-size shimmering chrome and metallic green personal lore computer.

04:15:08 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Because holy shit their noses are so far up his ass."

04:16:30 Your small palm-size metallic blue personal lore computer suddenly beeps quietly, indicating a new incoming file.

04:16:37 Several short bleeps emit from a small palm-size shimmering chrome and metallic green personal lore computer, followed by a hardcopy print of "I love you Rolando!".

04:17:52 Lileah Rose yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

04:21:29 You say to Lileah Rose, "Thanks love!"

04:21:37 Read what?

04:21:39 For a top, you are wearing a grey vee-neck shirt.  For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of black corduroy jeans over a pair of cotton briefs.  You have on some black leather boots.

04:21:39 You are carrying a hardcopy print of "I love you Rolando!" in your right hand.

04:21:45 There appears to be some writing on a hardcopy print of "I love you Rolando!"...

04:21:45

04:23:45 Lileah Rose says, "yeah I'd say we've likely been pushed down and perhaps Coreward"

04:25:10 Lileah Rose says, "I sure wish that Kaard guy would come to work. I guess he is avoiding me because I always have lots of questions."

04:25:15 Lileah Rose laughs.

04:25:45 You laugh.

04:25:52 There are 2 players connected:

04:25:52 Rolando Caganda  (A)      Lileah Rose  (A)           

04:26:01 You say, "Well, seems like hardly anyone comes to work."

04:28:17 Lileah Rose says, "yeah I know"

04:28:52 Lileah Rose says, "I sure would love ot do more combat Missions. we just may have to wing it with a corvette If we kill it, we'll jsut get another one."

04:28:59 Lileah Rose grins at you.

04:29:58 You grin.

04:30:02 You say, "I dn't mind trying."

04:30:04 Lileah Rose grins at you.

04:31:19 You say, "Sure."

04:31:24 You exclaim, "Just let me know!"

04:31:45 You ask, "Can I see the corvette?"

04:32:46 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What happened actually on Hyperion?"

04:32:56 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's still being investigated."

04:33:17 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I doubt we'll actually know the full truth of what happened. The media will probably skew everything, like they're doing with our strike."

04:33:38 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well, what's the thing with the border defense shift?"

04:33:45 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Another media skew."

04:33:49 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They sure the hell skewed my statement."

04:33:59 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What was the statement?"

04:34:16 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eli said in the broadcast that we will no longer be bringing resources for the alliance until the AEu decides to remain in the Accord again. However, we'll still continue to do beacon drops and things to push back against the Outsiders."

04:34:26 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Tabloid."

04:34:27 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

04:34:58 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I think she was asking about my broadcast too."

04:35:09 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Did you flat out refuse to participate in the Corps strike? It sounds like something you would do."

04:35:32 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Quite the opposite."

04:35:40 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Oooh lah lah."

04:38:03 Lileah Rose sits down on a lavender tapestry sectional sofa.

04:38:13 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Your welcome to read the entire statement, I kept a paper copy this time."

04:38:36 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Can I just advise you not to advise the Countil how to act?"

04:39:20 You grin.

04:39:21 You toggle a switch on the window blinds control board and a small glowing red indicator suddenly turns green.

04:39:21 The heavy hull plates shielding the windows suddenly begin sliding upwards, restoring functionality to the windows.

04:39:24 You toggle a switch on the window blinds control board and a small glowing green indicator suddenly turns red.

04:39:24 Heavy hull plates suddenly begin sliding down over the windows on the outside, gradually blocking off all view of the exterior.

04:39:27 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Interalliance."

04:39:29 You grin.

04:39:31 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

04:40:01 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

04:40:12 Lileah Rose says, "also"

04:40:23 Lileah Rose says, "prese the 'SCENT' button"

04:40:34 Lileah Rose deftly slides her finger downwards along a small optical strip near the windows and the sheer gold curtains leisurely draw together.

04:43:17 Lileah Rose grins at you.

04:43:21 Lileah Rose kisses you.

04:43:23 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What a waste."

* United Freight d'Intsec Mystified After AEU Pilots Target Medium Transports for Self-Destruction: "Perhaps We Should Reconsider Doing Business with the AEU Corps Given Current Political Climate" [11 August 2317] (DNA)

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

04:44:38 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Where's this statement, Vernos?"

04:44:38 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

04:44:53 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Right here in my hands."

04:44:56 You grin at Lileah Rose.

04:45:03 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well, send me a copy."

04:45:09 Lileah Rose grins at you.

04:45:20 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Alright."

04:45:33 Lileah Rose says, "there are a couple more items I may add. I just wasn't quite sure."

04:46:00 You beam at Lileah Rose.

04:46:25 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "And what's that tabloid headline about?"

04:47:56 You say to Lileah Rose, "Ready to go lie down?"

04:48:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "I knew we should have used alliance ships."

04:48:52 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Still can."

04:49:50 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Why? It's done whatever you've intended, more or less."

04:49:57 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It wasn't supposed to be an attack on United Freight. We went with transports as a symbol of indsutry."

04:49:57 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one said you can't sacrifice more resource-gathering ships. Asteroid haulers are alliance-exclusive."

04:50:32 Lileah Rose says to you, "sure Love"

04:50:34 Lileah Rose stands up.

04:50:38 Lileah Rose just went down.

04:50:38 [Stun Turret - Corridor Alpha] Lileah Rose just arrived.

04:50:40 [Stun Turret - Corridor Alpha] Lileah Rose just went down.

04:50:40 [Stun Turret - Corridor Beta] Lileah Rose just arrived.

04:50:41 [Stun Turret - Corridor Beta] Lileah Rose just went west.

04:50:46 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Blow up a few cruisers or gunships."

04:50:55 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "That's dumb."

04:50:56 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Warships? Really?"

04:51:13 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I already told Eli ththe inadvisability and general stupidity of blowing up warships."

04:51:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We need those in case there's an attack, that's why that wasnt' already done."

04:51:34 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't be so cavalier in wasting ships that could be potentially used to fight off Outsider and IFS invasions."

04:51:41 You stand up.

04:51:43 [Starship "Blueberry"; Corridor Alpha]

04:51:43 You see an internal stun turret here.
You can go south, west, up, and down.

04:51:45 [Starship "Blueberry"; Corridor Beta]

04:51:45 You see an internal stun turret here.
You can go east, west, up, and down.

04:51:46 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters Block Alpha]

04:51:46 You can go north, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

04:51:46 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, a cedar dresser, a set of funky asymmetrical shelves, and a large bureau here.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go out.

04:51:59 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well a cruiser costs the alliance, what amount of credits to produce?"

04:52:04 Lileah Rose tears off a sexy pink lace demi cup bra in a fit of passion.

04:52:04 Lileah Rose tears off a silk tanktop in a fit of passion.
Lileah Rose tears off some silk panties in a fit of passion.
Lileah Rose tears off a pair of flared faded denim jeans in a fit of passion.
Lileah Rose tears off a pair of white leather sandals in a fit of passion.
Lileah Rose rips off all of her obvious clothing and stands before you, positively glowing with near nudity.

04:52:10 You tear off a grey vee-neck shirt in a fit of passion.

04:52:10 You tear off a pair of cotton briefs in a fit of passion.
You tear off a pair of black corduroy jeans in a fit of passion.
You tear off some black leather boots in a fit of passion.
You stand there, glowing with near nudity.

04:52:13 Lileah Rose glances around.

04:52:15 Lileah Rose laughs.

04:52:16 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well a cruiser blown up is one less cruiser that could defend humanity."

04:52:22 Lileah Rose lies down on a walnut canopy bed.

04:52:28 You lie down on a walnut canopy bed.

04:52:31 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

04:52:33 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

04:52:33 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Are you insane?"

04:52:38 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Vernos?"

04:52:38 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

04:52:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Can I get half credit, the logic is not flawed."

04:52:46 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Well, I'm not really surprised that you're not getting it. You want the union to not withdraw from Accord, saying that Accord will aid in the defense, yet go blow up the defense ship. Dumb."

04:52:50 Lileah Rose leans close to you and kisses you softly on the chest.

04:52:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It costs them a shit ton of credits to produce."

04:53:02 Lileah Rose says to you, "you are sooo sexy"

04:53:19 You kiss Lileah Rose on the smooth skin above her breasts.

04:53:31 You say to Lileah Rose, "You are super sexy!"

04:53:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The logic is 100% flawed only because you want to use the cost of production to take away something from defense."

04:53:40 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I originally thought to do just that, but I can't very well stand and say we need to defend humanity and then blow up a ship that does just that."

04:53:44 You say to Lileah Rose, "I'd love to...."

04:53:55 You whisper to Lileah Rose.

04:54:04 Lileah Rose grins at you.

04:54:18 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Alright, fair point."

04:54:26 Lileah Rose says to you, "well know what? One day when we both decide we've had enough of work! ..."

04:54:31 Lileah Rose giggles quietly.

04:54:32 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I was thinking cost of production."

04:54:37 You grin at Lileah Rose.

04:54:41 You gently caress Lileah Rose's back.

04:54:50 Lileah Rose says, "I think when we go out exploring ..."

04:55:03 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eli and I discussed what ships would be best to blow up on several occasions. I privately worried that United would probably lash out, but I was hoping that they would be understanding about why we were doing it. Apparently, I've been right all along, and corporations really do only care more about filling their credit accounts more than they do about projects for hope."

04:55:04 You smile at Lileah Rose.

04:55:09 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

04:55:25 You say to Lileah Rose, "I mean, if you were ok with it of course and you wanted to."

04:55:35 Lileah Rose says to you, "with you ..."

04:55:43 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

04:56:03 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

04:56:23 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I don't agree with you, well, somewhat. They're planning to stop working with the union with the current political climate and that's not something Best can ignore. You'll achieve the same results with it."

04:56:50 You say to Lileah Rose, "I love you."

04:56:58 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I was thinking something simlar, but couldn't think of a good way to put it into words. My mind is fried after today."

04:57:02 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Won't matter for the immediate future regardless. We're not intending to bring in any resources for the time being."

04:57:05 You say to Lileah Rose, "And I don't want to lose you to anyone else."

04:57:31 You say to Lileah Rose, "Or share you with anyone else."

04:57:33 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Definitely. You won't need the ships as long as Best's over there anyway. So it doesn't really matter."

04:57:35 You grin at Lileah Rose.

04:57:39 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And it's not like we could go to them before hand and say "yo we're planning to do this." They would've probably tried to score points and ratted us out."

04:57:55 [General Communication] Voice of the Corps Vernos Bailey transmits, "And I back my pilot corps and refuse to ask them to do so."

04:57:56 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like I said, corporations care about their own interests and nothing else."

04:58:14 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Of course."

04:59:11 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, if it will help United cool their balls, I'm sure we could blow up hardened asteroid haulers so that they don't keep their panties in a twist."

04:59:27 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

04:59:43 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You wasteful people."

05:00:00 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

05:00:01 [General Communication] Corporate Prime Administrator Jean Poutine transmits, "One cannot spend hope, Monsieur Jammoa."

05:00:57 [General Communication] Voice of the Corps Vernos Bailey transmits, "Actually VET as you again promote fake news, I joined on my own free will and had only one concern which was establishing a fund to aid Hyperion."

05:01:11 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "One can understand the motivations behind all of this, and should have expected that appropriate reparations could've been made had the efforts were supported by the corporation whose ships had to be destroyed in order to make the statement as effective as possible."

05:03:14 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Blah."

05:03:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Vernos Bailey transmits, "Fucking piece of shit best ass kissing news organizations."

05:04:09 Lileah Rose says to you, "it's highly unlikely. not many are ever at work these days and so far, I haven't found anyone who is like you. You are just the right man for me."

05:04:25 Lileah Rose squeezes you affectionately.

05:04:27 I don't understand that.

05:04:29 Lileah Rose kisses you.

05:04:31 You squeeze Lileah Rose affectionately.

05:05:53 You say to Lileah Rose, "And you are the best woman in the universe for me."

05:06:01 Lileah Rose beams at you.

05:06:20 Lileah Rose says to you, "well you truly are the most awesome man in the Universe for me!"

05:06:28 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

05:07:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin sighs.

05:10:26 You kiss Lileah Rose on one of her breasts.

05:11:38 You kiss Lileah Rose softly on the stomach.

05:11:47 I don't understand that.

05:11:52 I don't understand that.

05:13:27 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

05:13:34 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

05:13:34 Lileah Rose says to you, "I love you"

05:13:40 You say to Lileah Rose, "I love you too."

05:14:06 Lileah Rose says to you, "I'll say nite and I love you. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:14:25 You say to Lileah Rose, "I love you too. Rest well and sweet dreams. Night."

05:14:35 Lileah Rose says to you, "Nite Love."

05:14:40 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

05:15:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm so fucking drained from all of thiso."

05:15:16 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. yeah, exactly, I can't even talk right."

05:15:25 You say to Lileah Rose, "Night love."

05:15:28 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

05:15:36 Lileah Rose says to you, "Nite sweet Love."

05:15:42 Lileah Rose squeezes you affectionately.

05:19:21 You say to Lileah Rose, "Night."

05:19:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. One thing is for sure. The folks who have been gone are going to have a lot of headlines to read when they get back, I suppose."

05:19:29 You squeeze Lileah Rose affectionately.

05:19:36 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Woo?"

05:19:47 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You mean a lot of misinformation?"

05:24:52 [MTTS] kayden has joined the channel.

05:26:11 [MTTS] kayden: I feel like I connect to this game daily and its a bad repeat of real life where the news twists and contorts things worst that fox news to promote an agenda.

05:27:29 [MTTS] Squidmind: Area Player Calls Host Headline Writing 'Bad'

05:28:04 [MTTS] usfolks: Dying from laughter...

05:28:12 [MTTS] kayden: Me too.

05:28:25 [MTTS] Ulias: Hahahahahah.

05:28:37 [MTTS] Squidmind: Though, we're not sure what you mean by 'promoting an agenda.'

05:28:41 [MTTS] kayden: I do feel like its a bad repeat of fox news or cnn some days though.

05:29:53 [MTTS] usfolks: Space opera at its best.

05:29:55 [MTTS] kayden: Eh the staff arent really promoting an agenda its more of an comparing real life to the game.

05:30:27 [MTTS] Squidmind: But... You just said that we're trying to promote an agenda...

05:30:28 [General Communication] Cheri first, think later, it's way less stressful

05:30:47 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I mean, act first think later."

05:31:28 [MTTS] kayden: Area player retracts statement, calls comparsion a terrible example.

05:32:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, I don't know I kinda like the first way better."

05:32:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.

05:32:19 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I don't even know what you mean."

05:32:51 [MTTS] kayden: I guess I just wish I did not connect to escape the current real world shit storm only to have to roleplay in a in character shit storm.

05:33:44 [MTTS] usfolks: We all chose our roles and make our decisions. They haven't been thrust upon us.

05:34:27 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

05:35:05 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think I just misheard something, is all."

05:35:29 [MTTS] kanamoto: This is one of those classic cases of 'actions have consequences'

05:36:53 [MTTS] usfolks: Kanamoto said it more siccinctly than I did, but the point is, you choose your alliance, you choose what your character does, you choose how you react to others, you choose how you deal with consequences for things you did or failed to do. If you have a "shit storm" it's one you built for your character.

05:37:03 [MTTS] usfolks: Also I can't type today. Succinctly is the word.

05:37:52 [MTTS] kayden: I guess.

05:38:37 [MTTS] Ulias: Fully embrace the shitstorm, revel in it. Consequences are what makes Sc great. And be comforted by the fact that there are actions you can take in SC that you can not in real life.

05:38:54 [MTTS] usfolks: Exactly Ulias.

05:39:10 [MTTS] kayden: Some days I do.

05:39:39 [MTTS] usfolks: Other days when you feel you can't, take a break. When you get too close to your char and the game isn't enjoyable, it's time to take a step back.

05:39:44 [MTTS] kayden: I'll use the AEU plot as an example. There are some days I hate the fuck out of it and then others its like this is sort of fun.

05:40:22 [MTTS] usfolks: You chose to create a character in the AEU. If you wanted a quiet existence in the game, that's the alliance with the least chance of that happening.

05:40:33 [MTTS] kayden: Seriously though that headline thing here on mtts was epic, squidmind.

05:41:00 [MTTS] Squidmind: Please get back in character.

05:41:32 [MTTS] kayden: Sure thing.

05:42:07 [MTTS] atherj: I don't suppose this would be the time to ask for a "help Mutuality politics" file then? Oh well!

05:42:57 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Org, don't even say the words "next broadcast" right now though."

05:43:10 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Next broadcast?"

05:43:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."

05:43:54 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Too late."

05:44:04 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Urmom?"

05:47:37 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Next broadcast: Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa eats terrible food that is not even fit for felo consumption."

05:47:57 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like...urmom."

05:48:34 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity. What the hell sort of conversation did I wake up to?"

05:48:36 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Give me a challenge."

05:49:01 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Enter the competitive tea drinking championships."

05:49:48 You have been idle for an extended period of time.  Please do something in order to avoid being disconnected.

05:50:02 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Is that challenging?"

05:50:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It would be for me, I fucking hate tea."

05:50:49 Lileah Rose yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

05:51:02 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Eh I have a challenge for Ather."

05:51:11 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "He can not say urmom for a week."

05:51:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Too easy."

05:51:41 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "A month then?"

05:51:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "He'd do it, just to prove that he could."

05:52:10 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I doubt his ability not to say urmom."

05:52:47 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Tea is good but not as good as coffee."

05:53:32 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What do you say Ather, can you do it?"

05:54:49 You have been idle too long.  Have a lovely evening.

07:02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I guess Shule and I aren't going to be rogued."

07:02:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I suppose not. I guess that's a good thing."

07:03:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I appearently can do no wrong even when I try to support you all."

07:03:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

07:03:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That headline was actually pretty hilarious."

07:03:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean it's not, but we'll be laughing about it months from now."

07:03:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. what would it say if all the pilots were rogued."

07:04:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."

07:04:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I just look like a giant asshole to everyone outside of the AEU."

07:12:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aisling is there liaison, yes."

07:12:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay. I wasn't sure, what with the weird titles they give themselves out there."

07:17:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Should I run for voice again or step away?"

07:18:53 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Outgoing QE message from AFW Command to Live Long And Prosper: NO <END>"

07:19:11 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "No what?"

07:19:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They asked if 270 was up."

07:19:22 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They asked if 274 was up."

07:22:56 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "QE message transfer to Live Long And Prosper complete."

07:23:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking I might run."

07:24:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though Eli told me you confirmed that the dissidents can still hold office."

07:24:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So we might not be short of more experienced people."

07:24:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Best's Man Vernos Bailey transmits, "They can but they face extreme skepticism from the government."

07:24:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That's if they even want to."

07:25:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] SPCF Member Vernos Bailey transmits, "That motherfucker gets on my nerves."

07:25:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's SPCF?"

07:25:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Society for the Protection of Felo."

07:25:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

07:26:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well if you run and I run you'll get it hands down constantine."

07:27:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think you might be right, even though I do think you've been doing a good job."

07:27:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'd like to go forward for a second term but yeah."

07:32:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I suppose you can see how people would feel about it."

07:32:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I know the answer already."

07:33:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think my main concern is that they're using you and you're making headlines for the wrong reasons."

07:33:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I know you're mad about it but the best move might be to just stop."

07:33:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It resembers the one that Aisling delivered."

07:41:28 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

09:25:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Um..."

09:25:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I... I don't know?"

09:25:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

09:30:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It might be ok, since it goes through the Teslabucks system. We're awarded indsutry points for them, but I think the metals and stuff are probably distrubted through the Accord.. You could try writing tot he EAOS about it, or I can if you want."

09:30:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can ask."

09:30:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Plus you get ground for it too."

09:31:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, and I've been wanting to work on my ground."

09:31:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I assume GMG is okay, right? There's no industry component to that, is there?"

09:32:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah GMG is fine."

09:32:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you get points from GMG, or are the special blueprints the only reward?"

09:33:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Exploration points."

09:33:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And I think a little ground."

09:33:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And parts, all the parts."

09:34:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've just been informed that GMG is the shit."

09:34:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

09:35:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It gives you all of the things, except the industry things, thus making it "the shit""

09:36:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ugh, I gotta get out there."

09:36:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I already hate this, I hated it before we even started it. I love brining in industry."

09:36:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, me too. I don't think we can back down now, though."

09:37:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh no, I'm not talking about backing down. Just saying that I hate it."

09:40:07 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacon?"

09:41:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'd say yes. Except...we have a slight problem, like that vents problem a while ago."

09:41:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's the problem?"

09:41:54 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "BACON!"

09:42:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "The one where--well, it speaks for itself."

09:42:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My mind is racing."

09:42:55 [General Communication] Eli Grey assaults your ears with a burst of static and screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs, "BIG HARRY'S MONKEY WAFFLE HOUSE."

09:43:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ow sanity!"

09:43:38 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...If it helps, eli is saying how he...doesn't want bacon from the vents."

09:44:01 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ohh, I get it."

09:44:09 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You're talking the problem from after the vents."

09:44:29 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

09:44:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes. That problem."

09:45:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "One of the classic problems."

09:45:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "At one stage, he also thought vartija was...Ather."

09:45:18 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could see it."

09:47:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey Constantine?"

12:43:40 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

12:43:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of projectile boost here.
You can go up and out.

12:43:43 Not much to see out there.

It is filled with water.
It is closed.

The scent of strawberry suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Glancing at the rose-tinted windows flanked by sheer gold curtains, you notice solid hull plates are shielding them externally, blocking all view of the outside.
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, a cedar dresser, a set of funky asymmetrical shelves, a large bureau, a sexy pink lace demi cup bra, a silk tanktop, some silk panties, a pair of flared faded denim jeans, a pair of white leather sandals, a grey vee-neck shirt, a pair of cotton briefs, a pair of black corduroy jeans, and some black leather boots here.

18:56:53 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:56:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

18:57:12 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:57:12 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:57:18 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:57:18 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:57:50 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

19:02:01 You glance at your communicator's screen.

19:02:01 There are no notices.

19:20:20 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

19:20:23 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:20:23 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:20:24 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:20:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:20:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:20:37 The ship is already moving.

19:20:39 The ship is already moving.

19:20:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:20:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:20:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:20:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:20:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:20:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:20:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:20:47 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:20:48 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

19:20:49 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:20:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:20:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:20:52 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:55:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
