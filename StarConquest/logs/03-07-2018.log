01:06 You glance at your communicator's screen.

01:06 Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! The Xenology station East of Steel phoenix Command will expire in a couple of days. Since the Xenology Scanner we're utilizing is rather pricey, and it has received only one use, although very generous, I am hesitant to redeploy a new Xenology station until we can verify that AEU pilots will utilize it. We will certainly put up future Xenology stations if AEU pilots participate in artifact hunting. The other Station which needs more activity is the Salvage processor East of Steel Phoenix Command. Please use it or lose it. AEU organizations will support at least the Asteroid, BAS and Salvage processing stations but if these stations are not utilized, then the resources expended are questionable. We certainly want to continue to promote income for all AEU pilots through less withdrawn from your proceeds which these temporary space stations provide. If anyone needs directions on how to access these stations, please ask. Fly safely! And fight hard on the ground! [18:45  6 March 2318 GST]

05:18 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
