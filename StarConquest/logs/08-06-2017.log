Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:22:08 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

01:22:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:22:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:22:18 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

01:22:22 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

01:22:28 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball of frozen water.

01:22:35 I don't understand that.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:30:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

01:30:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:31:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:31:19 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

01:31:24 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

01:37:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

01:37:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:37:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:37:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:39:50 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "They are."

01:40:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I just spent ages breeding one as close to Eli's color as I could. It even glows!"

01:40:26 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Wait.. it glows?"

01:40:40 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Did you put a light on it or something?"

01:40:40 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It does."

01:40:58 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It is a glowing felo. I mean he glows. So the felo needed to. As well."

01:41:31 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That sounds complicated. Does it involve irradiated chow?"

01:41:37 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Poke him later, and I'm sure he'll let you see it. I think I did quite well."

01:41:42 You power up the ship's engines, and the docking bay door begins to open slowly.

01:41:47 A launch trajectory is located.

01:41:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:41:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity no!"

01:41:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:42:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Glowing felo. Are a breed of felo already. I would never. Ever hurt a felo like that."

01:42:13 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

01:42:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:42:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:42:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:42:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah Luminaire is a cute fat little glowing blue kitten. Though I'm still not sure how I feel about him being obese, as Evenia said she wanted him to look as much like me as possible."

01:42:48 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, you are a bit round around the middle..."

01:42:52 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:42:52 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:43:22 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, uh, is that one of those things that you're not supposed to point out cause it might offend?"

01:43:23 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:43:23 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:43:24 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:43:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well no. But it was either an obese one. Or tiny! You are certainly not tiny!"

01:43:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

01:43:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:43:38 The ship is already moving.

01:43:54 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:43:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:43:57 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:44:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:44:06 You say, "Sure. Go for it."

01:44:08 You grin.

01:44:11 Lileah Rose grins.

02:09:43 "No matter how you may feel about other alliances, the people that live on Union worlds are our friends, our neighbors." Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself. "Doubtless many of you know one or more of these people. Perhaps they cut your hair, or sell you your groceries? Do we really want this for them? If you are saying 'What do I care about a bunch of non-Unioners?'then consider this, these people spend credits here. they pay their rents, buy our products and even contribute to their local communities. How will such a loss in our economy affect all of us? this is yet another reason that leaving the Accord is a bad plan for the future of the Union."

02:15:50 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an abandoned storage pod.

02:15:53 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:15:55 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

02:15:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:15:59 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

02:16:03 [MTTS] usfolks: So on a mod transport it's combining the core, on a constructor it's launching. And I'm so glad it's available...it's fixed a lot of sticky situations.

02:16:07 Ather nods at Eli and steps forward, clearing his throat with a mechanical cough and fixing his gaze on the camera.

02:16:11 Eli steps back from an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop.

02:16:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:16:15 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

02:16:20 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

02:16:23 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:16:25 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

02:16:25 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a drifting cloud of tritium.

02:16:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:16:29 [MTTS] usfolks: Disassembling isn't an accident waiting to happen, it's a solution to an accident.

02:16:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:16:57 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

02:17:02 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

02:17:04 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Eli here did a great job at telling you all why it's so important that we stay in the Accord. I just want to say a few more things which will hopefully drive the point home for those citizens who are still thinking about things."

02:17:07 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball of frozen water.

02:17:25 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "I know we're almost out of time, so I'll try to be brief."

02:17:25 Eli smiles almost imperceptibly.

02:17:30 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:17:30 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "First and foremost, I want to say that as a peoples, we have all been privilaged to live during interesting times. In spite of the lost technology which the Outsiders took from us back during the war, we have still made incredible advancement in spaceflight and a whole host of other areas."

02:17:32 [MTTS] Butchulla: Oh yes. With all the matching mess that you can sometimes get...I've come close to very pretty disasters before myself.

02:17:38 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

02:17:48 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "However, all of that could be taken away from us in an instant."

02:17:50 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:17:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:17:56 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:17:59 Eli Grey nods.

02:18:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:18:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:18:02 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:18:04 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

02:18:06 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "The Outsider threat is still real. Take it from someone who has fought them on numerous occasions before, the Outsiders have not gone away yet. They will never go away. They want to see the extinction of humanity, and are biding their time only for reasons we don't yet understand, not because we can beat them."

02:18:06 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:18:08 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah. Especially when my char first started building stations. I'm so glad they give us so many chances to fix our mistakes.

02:18:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:18:20 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

02:18:25 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

02:18:33 Lileah Rose presses some buttons on the sensor control board.

02:18:33 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as a piece of debris is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

Debris
------
Mass: Very Large
Coordinates: (3, 17, 3)
Distance: 9
------

02:18:35 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Only a year or so ago in fact, we fought Outsider starships with incredibly strong armor. Armor that even made it difficult for a cruiser to destroy them. Imagine what would happen if we faced a much larger fleet of those ships. I can tell you what would happen fellow citizens, we wouldn't stand a chance on our own."

02:18:41 Lileah Rose presses some buttons on the sensor control board.

02:18:41 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as a piece of debris is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

02:18:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:19:01 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "And a lot of those ships were only Outsider Martial-class heavy fighters. Small ships, in the grand scheme."

02:19:06 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

02:19:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:19:11 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

02:19:16 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of rock and organic materials.

02:19:23 Lileah Rose presses some buttons on the sensor control board.

02:19:27 [MTTS] davetaylor: God, I'm still paranoid when I build stations, I spend ages making sure what I want is on the right lifter, in the right order and everything, heaven knows what I'd do if I was building two at once.

02:19:31 Lileah Rose presses some buttons on the sensor control board.

02:19:31 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as a piece of debris is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

02:19:42 [MTTS] Ulias has left the channel.

02:19:44 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

02:19:45 Ather's optics unit dims slightly, the glow taking on a slight reddish hew as he continues, "Anyone in the Union who is of age and older now knows what the Outsiders are capable of. Most of you should still remember the bombings which destroyed, for example, the AEU headquarters as Eli indicated at the beginning of this broadcast. Do we really want to go through that again?"

02:20:08 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "That should prove to everyone that the Outsiders do have the means to do what they want to do. They are just not doing it at this moment. However, it doesn't mean that they won't. It means that they're waiting for what they believe is the right time."

02:20:25 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "We all have theories on what those right times are supposedly are, I'm not going to get into that. However, you should know that just because they're only attacking in small numbers for now, doesn't mean that they will not attack with the same overwhelming force that they used during the war in the future."

02:20:25 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:20:27 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

02:20:32 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

02:20:37 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a single spacesuit glove.

02:20:42 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

02:20:47 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

02:20:47 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "That reason, as well as others that were mentioned, are among the many reasons why it's imparative we stay in the Accord. Together with the other alliances, our chances of fighting the Outsiders as well as other enemies off and saving our people increases. If we fight on our own, then we're likely all going to be destroyed. Alone and without the fighting chance that we were all hoping for."

02:20:52 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of titanium.

02:20:56 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

02:21:58 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:21:59 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

02:22:00 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a defunct sector probe.

02:22:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:22:02 I don't understand that.

02:22:23 Ather raises a hand as he concludes by saying, "I hope President Best and the current administration takes this councel to heart. That they ultimately decide to do not only what is best for the Union, but for the whole of humanity as well, by remaining in the Accord and contributing to research that can help combat the Outsiders, as well as the other threats that we face." After he stops speaking, he keeps his unblinking mechanical gaze locked onto the camera for several seconds, then finally turns away and nods at Eli.

02:22:37 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:23:17 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

02:23:23 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

02:23:30 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'one hour.'"

02:23:30 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a detached hull plate.

02:24:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:24:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:24:33 "I would like to point out that the armored ships that mister Jammoa mentioned, were only taken down with the suits I mentioned at the beginning of this broadcast." Eli Grey nods. "Yet another use for the technology created through the combined effots of the Accord."

02:24:53 Ather gives an imperceptible shake of his head.

02:24:59 A glowing clock blinks silently, giving you your five minute warning.

02:25:04 A glowing clock blinks silently, giving you your five minute warning.

02:25:11 Eli Grey says, "Oh.. perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong ships."

02:25:13 Eli Grey coughs.

02:25:27 Ryo Stel grins at Eli Grey.

02:25:59 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

02:26:04 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

02:26:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:26:38 Eli Grey says, "I'll conclude tonight with this. To the citizens who have heard our broadcast, mae your opinions on this matter known. Start discussions with your friends, your co-workers. Spread the word about the importance of remaining in the Accord. To the members of governmentt who are actiely fighting against this, please keep fighting.. We're al counting on you. May you all find peace and joy in your lives."

02:27:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:27:22 Ryo Stel cheers for Eli Grey!

02:27:27 Ryo says to Eli, "Well said."

02:27:36 Eli leads his fellow pilots toward the exit, revealing the dragonfly on his back, and leaving an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop remaining on the screen.

02:27:42 Lileah Rose presses some buttons on the navigation board.

02:27:44 You follow Eli Grey out.

02:27:44 [The Torus; Public Access Center]
Eli Grey and Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa are standing here. Ryo Stel is leaning against a wall.
You can go out.

02:27:45 Request for entry into Yuuijuminlakiltra's docking bay sent.

02:27:45 Yuuijuminlakiltra accepts the entry request.

02:27:50 You feel a bit of acceleration as the ship begins docking procedures.

02:27:54 You cheer for Eli Grey!

02:27:54 Eli Grey lets out a long deep breath.

02:27:55 You hear a solid thud as the ship sets down in a larger ship's docking bay.

02:27:58 Lileah Rose brings up the controls to transfer cargo.

02:27:58 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says to Eli, "Bah, I wish you didn't try to clarify my clarifications!"

02:27:59 You say to Eli, "Good job."

02:28:03 Ryo Stel stops leaning against a wall.

02:28:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cheers.

02:28:06 Eli says to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa, "Ugh I thought you were talking about armored thralls."

02:28:08 You hear metallic scraping as the transfer of the cargo begins.

02:28:08 More sounds from the storage room are heard as another piece of cargo is transferred.

02:28:09 More sounds from the storage room are heard as another piece of cargo is transferred.

02:28:10 More sounds from the storage room are heard as another piece of cargo is transferred.

02:28:32 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Those are different vessels, but still no less dangerous. Those ships cannot be destroyed utilizing only conventional shipboard weapons and require, as Eli pointed out, an attack using battlesuits. These specific warships which I mentioned, were specifically of Outsider design, and could be destroyed with conventional weapons. It just took a lot of work."

02:31:31 [The Torus; Garage]

02:31:32 You can go up.

02:31:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Urmom!"

02:31:35 I don't understand that.

02:31:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was waiting to get that out."

02:31:40 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

02:31:41 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:31:42 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:31:42 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:31:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Still, it's not like you intentionally forgot that."

02:32:00 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "He didn't forget it on purpose, but they'll do what they can to discredit him."

02:32:08 Board what?

02:32:10 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:32:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

02:32:25 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Of course they will."

02:32:34 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Alas."

02:32:57 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I suppose I could issue a correction like last time, though I doubt it will h elp or matter."

02:33:39 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "When I did that before, they just used that to try and say the whole thing was wrong, except for a couple of the news soruces."

02:36:01 Lileah Rose powers up the ship's engines, and the docking bay door begins to open slowly.

02:36:06 A launch trajectory is located.

02:36:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:36:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:36:18 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:36:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:36:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:36:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:36:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:36:38 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:36:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

02:36:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:36:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:37:23 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

02:37:28 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

02:37:32 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

02:37:32 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:02:00 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:02:03 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

03:02:08 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

03:02:13 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of gold.

03:02:18 Storage hold contents:

03:02:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

03:02:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:02:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:02:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:02:35 Autopilot condense on.

03:02:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, there you have it folks. You're getting a privatised corps anyways."

03:03:02 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:03:05 The Jinu starship "Yuuijuminlakiltra" has a docking bay large enough to contain this ship.  You can request entry into its docking bay, or dock in the usual manner by connecting to the docking ring near the control room.

03:03:05 Would you like to request entry into the docking bay?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

03:03:06 Request for entry into Yuuijuminlakiltra's docking bay sent.

03:03:07 Yuuijuminlakiltra accepts the entry request.

03:03:11 You feel a bit of acceleration as the ship begins docking procedures.

03:03:16 You hear a solid thud as the ship sets down in a larger ship's docking bay.

03:03:57 A launch trajectory is located.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:04:02 [MTTS] lunarfang: Ok. I'm going to sound really stupid but what does that mean. Does that mean he's making the core private so not just anyone can join? Or am I missing the point intirely.

03:04:03 You say, "71 jinu"

03:04:07 You grin.

03:04:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:06:12 [MTTS] Squidmind: Privatization is the process where a publicly controlled enterprise or industry (IE, owned by the government) is sold to the private sector, usually businesses or corporations.

03:06:17 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yes, it is.

03:06:50 [General Communication] Samual Janisberg transmits, "hello"

03:06:53 [MTTS] lunarfang: Thanks squidmind. Sorry for the stupid question. Just didn't know if it was right to ask in char or not so figured. Well anyway. Thanks for the answer. I feel less stupid now.

03:07:04 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Best just went all Rebane up in this shit."

03:07:41 [General Communication] Samual Janisberg transmits, "anyone up for missions or something?"

03:07:56 [MTTS] wulf: That might be like another famous word, nucular.

03:08:06 [MTTS] usfolks: And of course, covfefe.

03:08:16 [MTTS] lunarfang: Always the cofefe.

03:08:17 There are 3 players connected:

03:08:17 Lileah Rose  (A)          Rolando Caganda  (A)       Samual Janisberg  (L)

03:08:21 You say, "wow"

03:08:25 [General Communication] Rolando Caganda transmits, "Hello"

03:08:56 Lileah Rose says, "this guy is prety dull"

03:09:00 Lileah Rose says, "pretty"

03:09:05 The computer reports that the one-person salvage junker "Morlock" has jumped into the sector.

03:09:14 Lileah Rose says, "oh I'd love to shoot that hehe"

03:09:23 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:09:28 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:09:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

03:09:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:09:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:09:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:09:44 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:09:50 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

03:09:55 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

03:12:38 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:12:39 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I think is very funny, yes."

03:12:41 Lileah Rose begins scanning for debris.

03:12:46 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

03:12:56 Lileah Rose says, "I'm tempted to tell him that we're making wild love"

03:12:59 Lileah Rose laughs.

03:13:03 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

03:13:13 Lileah Rose presses some buttons on the sensor control board.

03:13:14 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as a piece of debris is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

03:13:29 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

03:13:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

03:13:30 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'ten minutes.'"

04:13:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, thanks for reminding me. I'll go do that right now."

04:13:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:13:06 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:13:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:13:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:13:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:13:22 The ship is already moving.

04:13:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:13:24 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:13:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:25 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:13:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:29 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 168" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

04:13:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:13:32 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:13:32 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:13:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:13:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:13:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:13:36 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:13:39 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

04:13:40 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

04:13:41 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:13:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:13:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:13:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:13:56 Lileah Rose says, "we're trying but he's already been heavy-handed and rogued our two best pilots so what the fuck is he going to do to screw the rest of us."

04:14:01 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:14:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:14:09 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:14:10 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

04:14:10 You can go out and enter into the ship.

04:14:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:15:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:15:24 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:15:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:16:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:16:19 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:42:48 Gentle winds blow the high grasses back and forth, occasionally strongly enough to push it into your path. The road is in obvious bad repair, but you don't pay it much mind, keeping your eyes on the horizon. Faint sounds of animal life can be heard over the wind. On the west side of the road the grass has been trampled, and you can see a faint trail leading from here through the grassy countryside. In addition, a bright red and white sign on the other side of the road points the way down a clear path to the Felo Sanctuary to the east.
You can go north, east, and south.

04:42:58 [Hyperion; Sea of Grass]

04:42:58 You can go east and west.

04:42:59 [Hyperion; Sea of Grass]

04:42:59 Long grass waves in the breeze along this straight path. Though the path is unpaved, the dirt has been packed down and is marked by faint vehicle tracks. The air is fresh and cool. About a quarter-mile away to the east, a white warehouse-like building stands up out of the waving grass.
You can go east and west.

04:43:07 [Hyperion; Sea of Grass]

04:43:07 You can go east and west.

04:43:07 [Hyperion; Sea of Grass]

04:43:08 This quiet path is framed by tall grass waving in the wind. The air is fresh but smells occasionally of wet fur. A large white warehouse stands up out of the grass about a fifth of a mile to the east. Above the grass in a generally northwestern direction, you can see the faint gleam of the spaceport.
You can go east and west.

04:43:16 [Hyperion; Sea of Grass]

04:43:17 You can go east and west.

04:43:18 [Hyperion; Sea of Grass]

You can go east and west.

04:43:27 [Hyperion; Felo Sanctuary]

04:43:27 You can go west.

04:43:29 [Hyperion; Felo Sanctuary]

04:43:30 The path ends here in a clearing in the tall grass. The clearing is only twenty feet wide, as though whoever made it wanted to have as little impact on the environment as possible. On the east side of it is a squarish white building, its plain facade decorated with a painted arch formed of the colorful silhouettes of small cat-like creatures. In the center of the wall is a small door with a large sign that you can LOOK at beside it and a bright red box marked 'Donations!' beneath it. Extending from the building into the grass on either side is a very high square-link fence which leaves narrow open spaces on either side where the interior of the compound is visible.
You can go west.

06:23:53 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm not convinced that a grapple is supposed to do any sliding.. but hey, you're the Salvage Queen."

06:25:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well. You know. It's not all about shoving it in all the time. Sliding it in at the right angle. Will give you much better results."

06:26:13 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Yes.. do remind me to not ask about how you come about having so many felo."

06:26:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity!"

06:26:55 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's not the grade of your grapple, it's how you use it."

06:27:14 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And other various innuendos! Ok, I'm finished now."

06:28:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If you get the angle just right, you'll get it to shatter into a million pieces. Best feeling in the world."

06:35:46 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Maybe it's what you're grappling?"

06:36:16 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't much enjoy grappling rocks. I'd rather haul big ones."

06:36:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

06:37:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You need to try shipwrecks, or comets. I hate grappling asteroids myself."

06:37:29 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, shipwrecks or comets are the best. Especially medium ones."

06:37:32 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't much enjoy comets either. Been considering heading out to 777, but I want to get a mighty grapple before I do."

06:38:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "777 is beautiful."

06:40:48 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I wonder at what point I'll have access to a mighty grapple."

06:42:43 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No one ever uses fine-toothed. Poor fine-toothed grapple."

06:43:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I loved that thing."

06:43:51 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm using one currently. Should I be feeling weird?"

06:44:09 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um...I can't see at what industry you'll get it. but the first one is a grade 30 grapple."

06:44:48 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Probably somewhere around 200 points then."

06:45:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I used that grapple for the longest time, till I thought to try a mighty."

06:45:49 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't even know the particular difference, I just remember reading that mighty is great."

06:45:55 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "In some ways, they can be better than a mighty, but the mighty is better just based off how much time it saves."

06:46:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's one of those things, where the fine-toothed is probably better in theory, but the mighty is better in practice."

06:55:46 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person light transport "Procyon". The organization has earned 505,061.31 credits.

07:15:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach snickers.

07:16:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grumbles.

07:16:13 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

07:18:17 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Huh. Sort of makes me want one."

07:18:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I am not specially breeding a felo for anyone, for a long time. That guy took serious effort. I need a break."

07:19:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A felo? I never really wanted one before, but somehow I have three now."

07:19:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach gasps.

07:19:33 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And I love all three of them. They're great."

07:19:52 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nice save there."

07:20:30 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Where do you even find them? I only really know about the sanctuary on Hyperion."

07:20:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, it wasn't a save. It's true. I used to keep a ship full of them for bari, and it was tiresome so I tok them all to the sanctuary."

07:21:02 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You can get them from other pilots."

07:21:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But now that there's the tonic and such, I've gotten prety attached to the ones that I have."

07:21:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think the sanctuary let you adopt."

07:23:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sadly around here, I'm known as the felo expert."

07:24:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Why sadly?"

07:24:23 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Is it true, though?"

07:24:49 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I certainly understand them very well. And I seem to be able to breed most any kind. But..."

07:24:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'd love to be called an expert at something I'm good at and love."

07:25:26 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You're an expert eater, yeah, Eli?"

07:25:32 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Felo expert would be fine. But I don't so much like felo queen."

07:25:55 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey!"

07:26:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs.

07:26:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That wasn't cool."

07:26:51 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hmm? I figure that most people are expert eaters, since we sort of need to do so to live."

07:26:52 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I make those jokes, because the felo I managed to breed for Eli was obese. But eli honestly isn't fat."

07:27:11 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm apparently an expert at making easily ignored broadcasts."

07:27:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli?"

07:27:44 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Urmom?"

07:27:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

07:28:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Urmom your damn face."

07:28:14 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The front part of your head's a face."

07:28:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I hate your face."

07:28:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ouch."

07:28:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

07:28:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Touche."

07:29:13 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Perla Marion."

07:29:17 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That one wasn't even funny, it just cold."

07:29:30 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh dear."

07:29:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Um.. which ship is that? Johann?"

07:29:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes."

07:30:12 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess we could have sent them a message too, though there's only one AEU person aboard."

07:31:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What were you really going to say a bit ago, before I said urmom."

07:32:17 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or were you always going to tell me you hate my face."

07:32:34 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I was going to tell you, to stop it. Think about it. If the media were so quick to pounce on that one thing, don't you think the media noticed the good things too?"

07:34:26 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't think the media is your intended audience anyhow."

07:34:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Perhaps, though the only one who cared to publish anything was clearly biased New Earth News. Either way it's not necessarily the media I'm trying to reach."

07:35:11 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Things take time though, so it remains to be seen if it's had any effect, I suppose."

07:35:21 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I need someone to come over like now. And check out accord space. We've got fighters in here. And peacekeepers and...it's rather a mess."

07:35:52 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm coming."

07:35:53 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Over accord itself. I'm in a carrier, so rather useless to help."

07:37:32 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just fighters?"

07:37:56 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's all I saw. But I admit I freaked out. So didn't get to properly check classes."

07:38:21 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Jumping now. If it's bad I may need to go back and get the Combat scout."

07:38:38 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm on dock one if you need a gunner."

07:39:35 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Holy shit, it's Outsiders."

07:39:52 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That's what I meant to say. That's why I freaked."

07:39:52 [Tactical Communication] Aisling transmits, "What?"

07:39:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What we got Eli?"

07:40:17 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Outsiders above accord, Aisling."

07:40:25 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're just fighters, but still."

07:44:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And of course, my weapons are off since I went artifacting in this."

07:45:27 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Perla Marion to AFW Command: H7 270 0 70 <END>"

07:47:03 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Vernos. If you need a gunner. Land again and scoop me up."

07:47:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I should probably stay away with my basic fighter, yeah?"

07:49:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hell, I forgot my fighter is on Old Earth anyways. I never did get it back to New Earth."

08:06:11 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Perla Marion."

08:07:57 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Accord command clear."

08:09:11 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Thank sanity. Thanks guys. I'm so sorry I screwed up with what I said. I freaked because I've never seen them there, ever."

08:10:13 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "It is me."

08:10:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I thought so, but I didn't want to assume."

08:10:55 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nice work everybody. Civilian pilots and peacekeepers alike."

08:12:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Patrolling home sectors."

08:15:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I started that fight with my weapons off again due to artifacting in this ship...need to remember to flip that breaker back on after."

08:16:34 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Gonna check the uncalimed sectors real quick."

08:16:47 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Want help?"

08:16:48 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This could have been a diversion."

08:16:59 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually eha, let me land."

08:17:05 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Where?"

08:17:29 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "New Earth?"

08:26:04 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Stay frosty folks. I don't like this. Two fighters to Accord Command seems to much like a diversion."

08:27:47 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Perla Marion to AFW Command: DISRGRD PRV MSG <END>"

08:39:11 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We should have crewed up, I wasn't thinking. Was thinking about how there's not many folks around and just went in with a fighter. Sorry folks."

08:39:50 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Are we all still alive?"

08:40:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We are all still alive.. for now."

08:40:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes. We're just super lucky I decided to go be nosey and check that qe that was coming in."

08:41:27 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Eve's curiosity and Eli's brevity saved the day then?"

08:42:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And Aisling in her Juno and Vernos in his combat scout. And of course, lots of hardcore Peacekeepers."

13:27:54 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:27:55 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Hyperion; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?

8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issues missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?

9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?

10. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?

11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?

12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?

13. You must choose a theme song that you will completely rock out to while fighting. What song do you choose?

15:06:19 You scan the questions written on a starship requisition application and begin filling them out.

15:06:19 (15 seconds roundtime.)

15:06:34 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

15:06:34 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:14:09 You entered: I would attempt to destroy any chaining or interdicting ships before engaging other ships in case I need to run. Having done so, I would attempt to cripple the hostile force as much as possible. If the hostile force is left alone, it could very well be strengthened by other forces in the area before finding its way to civilian locations and causing destruction.

15:14:09 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:14:19 2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

15:19:36 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]

15:19:37 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, a cedar dresser, a set of funky asymmetrical shelves, a pair of white leather sandals, some black leather boots, a satin bra, a purple silk blouse, a pair of skimpy pink lace bikini cut panties, a pair of flared faded denim jeans, a plaid button down shirt, a pair of cotton briefs, and a pair of black corduroy jeans here.
Lileah Rose is asleep.
You can go out.
(You are lying on a walnut canopy bed.)

15:20:04 You entered: I would report my location, the number of ships and their classes over tactical and ask for reinforcements. Then I would engage them as above, attempting to make sure I have the ability to run and get repairs if necessary. With it being a direct threat to a civilian location, I would continue to fight the ships until they are all destroyed. If my ship gets destroyed, I would just grab another ship. It is my duty and responsibility to protect human space from all threats.

15:20:04 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:20:12 3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

15:20:12 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:29:13 You entered: I prefer to be short one gunner. Since AEU ships rely primarily on their lasers and as such, use a lot of grid, I would much rather have someone able to recharge the grid. IF the grid is completely drained, the ship's weapons become much less effective. Against such ships as rapid assault ships or any assault warpers, it is imperative that these ships be destroyed as quickly as possible. When the ship does Get hit, the engineer's ability to be able to use a quick patch readily can be the difference between losing a failsafe or not. Another advantage of being short one gunner as opposed to being short an engineer is that if the grid does get depleted in one weapon room, the gunner can move to the empty weapons room until such time that their original weapon room is fully charged again.

15:29:13 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:29:20 4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

15:29:20 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:38:36 You entered: I engage any ships that are chaining me, destroy any interdictors and any ships that are interdicting all the while getting as close to the edge as possible in order to make a quick get away. Having taken note of the number of ships that remain, I then land, obtain repairs, and use long-range scans to determine how many ships are in the hostile sector. I would wait long enough to find out how many enemy ships responded as reinforcements. I would report all of this over tactical and ask for assistance. If I am unable to escape from the sector, I keep the ship moving, make repairs, land if possible and request assistance over tactical.

15:38:36 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:38:54 5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

15:38:54 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:42:58 You entered: We engage and destroy the escorting ships and leave the sector as a mothership cannot be destroyed by conventional weapons. The last mothership had to be destroyed with the use of battle suits. Therefore, we leave and don't come back unless we have cruisers that have the special shielding that can repel the PDB and battle suits.

15:42:58 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:43:16 6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

16:05:11 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:05:23 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

16:09:37 You entered: I engage any interdicting or chaining ships first then any other small ships that I can destroy before leaving. My goal would be to cripple the hostile force as much as possible. If they are left alone, they could be strengthened and find their way to beacon sectors and attack civilian locations.

16:09:37 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:09:42 2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

16:09:42 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:16:22 You entered: I would report my current location, number of ships and their classes over tactical asking for reinforcements. While reinforcements are on the way, I would engage any chaining or interdicting ships and destroy any interdictors to enable friendly ships to be able to leave and obtain repairs. I would also recommend that a crew be placed on stand-by at the civilian location that is being threatened. Then I would set about destroying as many enemy ships as possible.

16:16:22 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:21:03 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

16:21:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

16:21:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:21:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:28:09 You scan the questions written on a starship requisition application and begin filling them out.

16:28:09 (15 seconds roundtime.)

16:28:24 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

16:28:24 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:31:39 You entered: write application

16:31:39 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:31:48 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

16:31:48 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:31:52 You entered: I engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships and then destroy any interdictors that are in the sector. I then would try to destroy as many ships as possible before I leave. If left alone, the hostile force could be reinforced and eventually find its way to a civilian location and attack it. My goal would be to try to cripple it as much as possible and still save my ship.

16:31:52 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:32:14 2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

16:32:14 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:36:16 You entered: I would report my location, number and class of enemy ships and request reinforcements over tactical. I would also recommend that a crew be placed on stand-by at the civilian location. While reinforcements are on the way, I would engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships as well as destroy any interdictors in the sector. Then I would simply attempt to destroy all of the enemy ships. It is my duty and responsibility to protect human alliance space from all hostile threats.

16:36:16 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:36:21 3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

16:36:21 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:42:19 You entered: I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships rely heavily on lasers that drain the grid rather quickly, it is imperative that someone is able to recharge the grid as frequently as possible. If the combat grid is depleted, the ship's weapons lose their effectiveness. Another advantage of being short a gunner is that if a gunner's combat grid is drained, he or she can move to the empty weapons room until such time that their original weapons room's grid is recharged. If the ship does get hit, the ability of the engineer to apply quick patches to the hull can be the difference between losing a failsafe or not. Experienced engineers also can have access to tools that can increase the damage for a single weapon room thereby helping to compensate for being short a gunner.

16:42:20 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:42:33 4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

16:42:34 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:46:12 You entered: I attempt to destroy any chaining ships, interdicting ships and any interdictors in the sector all the while staying close to the edge in order to make a quick get away. Having taken note of the number of ships remaining in the sector, I leave, obtain repairs, and use long-range scans to determine the number of the reinforcing ships. I report all of this over tactical and ask for reinforcements.

16:46:12 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:46:20 5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

16:46:20 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:51:02 You entered: We destroy the escorting ships and leave since this kind of ship cannot be destroyed by conventional weapons. The last magistrate-class mothership had to be captured with the use of battle suits. We contact the Accord and don't come back without cruisers that have been adapted with special shielding that can repel a PDB and battle suits.

16:51:02 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:51:08 6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

16:51:08 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:57:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good morning Union."

16:57:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good mroning general type people."

16:58:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli."

16:58:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You guys missed all the very early morning excitement."

16:58:33 You entered: My priority would be the capitol planets as they are the most inhabited and also the primary beacon sectors since they are used the most and one must fly through those sectors to get to capitol sectors. If, for example, providence Gate were to be interdicted, other ships would not be able to get to New Earth until such time that Providence Gate was no longer interdicted.

17:00:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Two Outsider Marshall, with extremely good pilots, attacked Accord Command."

17:02:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aisling in her Juno, me in a fighter, and Vernos in his combat scout, plus a whole slew of peacekeepers took them down eventually, but it was an insane fight. Wouldn't have even known it was going down had Evenia not jumped right into the middle of it."

17:03:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have they ever attacked accord command before?"

17:04:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello. Seems it might have been better if all of you had grabbed one big ship. I don't know though."

17:04:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So anyways, stay vigilant today, I'm not sure what they're up to, but sending two heavy fighters to Accord Command sounds too much like some kind of test. I thought it was a diversion at first, but everything was quiet afterwards."

17:05:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, I thought that Vernos had picked up Evenia in the scout, but apparently he didn't want to or something. The Juno is a four-person combat ship so we probably should have crewed in that. Though with how these guys were moving it might have been a good thing that we were able to come at them from different angles."

17:06:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But I agree, crewing up would have been a better option. When Eve first called the alert she idn't see exactly what was in there, so I went in my fighter to check it out. With so many folks being gone I didn't even wait to see if there was enough folks awake to do anything."

Also thought the other letter one was also acknowledged. I suppose it was only a matter of time before I got carried away with support tickets. Sorry friendly mind of the squid.

17:14:38 You sign several notices and affirmations on a starship requisition application.

17:14:38 (60 seconds roundtime.)

17:14:51 [MTTS] Ulias: Also, that last one was more of an FYI than anything, wasn't realy expecting that one to go anywhere, was just something I did in character that I wanted to notify you about.

17:15:07 [MTTS] Ulias: But I will try not to overload the Squidmind again!

17:15:23 You must be in a ship store to submit a starship requisition application

17:15:27 Wait 11 seconds.

17:15:31 Wait 8 seconds.

17:15:42 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:15:42 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:15:44 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:15:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

17:15:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:15:58 The ship is already moving.

17:15:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:16:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:16:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:16:01 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

17:16:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:16:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:16:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:16:07 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:16:08 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

17:16:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:16:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:16:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:16:12 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:16:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:16:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:16:46 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

17:16:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

17:16:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:17:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:17:05 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:17:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:17:20 You hand a starship requisition application to a nearby technician, who looks it over. The technician laughs suddenly, then hastily covers it with a cough as they look up at you sheepishly and throw the application into an outgoing bin, saying, "All right, looks like you're all set. You'll hear back in the mail on their decision."

17:17:37 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.

17:23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thanks for telling me about the attack over Acord. That's important information. I hope that they weren't scouting or getting ready to do something."

17:24:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I was super nervous afterwards. I was about to try and get some real sleep for a change when it happened, but was too paranoid afterwards to tdo so. At least for a bit."

The reason there's 3 actions in it, is because I wanted it to be clear that I wasn't really expecting a staff response.

20:04:49 A police drone turns and goes northwest.

20:04:56 [Chetumal; Landing Pad]
Seemingly the hub of all the activity, the Landing Pad is full of people coming and going, arriving and departing. The pleasant thrum of conversation is underlined with the opening and closing of the entrance lock, the swishing of automatic doors, and sharp sounds of feet on tile.

You stand at the apex of Ixtapa, a city of cement ramps and plasteel towers, with a greater height than width. The rails along the edge of the hexagonal apex form a rather inadequate windbreak, and the force of the wind continually pushes you against other people and into various immobile objects.

21:32:22 Current coordinates: (12, 10, 1)


21:32:26 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

21:32:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:32:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:32:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:33:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:33:41 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:33:44 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:33:49 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:33:54 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball of frozen water.

21:34:16 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

21:34:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:35:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:35:10 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:35:15 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:35:20 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a single spacesuit glove.

21:36:53 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as a piece of debris is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

Debris
------
Mass: Very Small
Coordinates: (5, 2, 4)
Distance: 10
------

21:37:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:37:41 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:37:46 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:37:51 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a single spacesuit glove.

Scan which debris?
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:39:51 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as a piece of debris is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

21:39:51 
Debris
------
Mass: Small
Coordinates: (4, 8, 2)
Distance: 3
------

21:39:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:40:00 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:40:05 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:40:10 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an old engine casing.

21:42:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:42:48 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:42:52 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:42:57 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

21:43:02 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

21:43:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:43:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:43:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:52:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I love my fighter, she's gotten me through many a battle."

22:59:19 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I like both. I love the standard fighter because it has an ftl drive, but I like the bastille because of the hull and the grid."

22:59:46 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh yeah, they both for sure have their good and bad sides."

22:59:56 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But lately, I've just been flying around in Eve's favorite ship, Firestorm."

23:01:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I hate that ship."

23:09:25 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It loves you too, Eve!"

23:14:50 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

23:50:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, there's an IFS warship in Orion."

23:51:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "On it."

23:51:11 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:51:12 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:51:14 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:51:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:51:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:51:22 The ship is already moving.

23:51:27 The ship is already moving.

23:51:29 The ship is already moving.

23:51:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:51:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:51:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:51:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

23:51:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:51:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:51:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:51:38 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: _5QClpyH71!+eycIAUV~}2^#<AIq{dfCM|jibKn'
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:51:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:51:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:51:43 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:51:44 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

23:51:44 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.

23:51:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:51:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:51:48 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:51:49 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."
