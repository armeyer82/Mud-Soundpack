00:42:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:42:11 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:42:15 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:42:15 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:42:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:42:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:42:18 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:42:19 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:42:20 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:42:21 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

00:42:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:42:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:42:23 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:42:26 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

00:42:26 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Fearless! Welcome to home space!"

01:04:35 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

01:04:36 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

01:12:39 You nod to Ather Jammoa.

01:12:55 Johnathon says to Ather, "60."

01:13:01 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

01:13:03 You say, "Oh, sorry. I meant rental 1."

01:13:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I can switch to AEU."

01:13:40 Ather Jammoa says, "That would suck pretty epically too, because we need two EAOS suits."

01:13:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or EAOS but then Johnathon will have to do all repairs."

01:13:59 Ather Jammoa says, "Shule and I would be EAOS since we know how to use them, you could stay as league, I suppose."

01:15:52 Ather Jammoa strides in from the north.

01:15:55 Ather Jammoa presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Elementalist from storage and sets it in front of him.

01:15:55 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:15:57 Ather Jammoa presses a button on an EAOS Elementalist, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

01:16:11 Johnathon Triggs walks in from the north.

01:16:15 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Conjurer from storage and sets it in front of you.

01:16:15 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:16:17 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

01:16:19 Johnathon Triggs presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour from storage and sets it in front of him.

01:16:19 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:16:21 Johnathon Triggs presses a button on an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

01:17:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All here?"

01:17:55 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

01:17:55 [Aerial Fortress "Petunia"; Deployment]
You see Ather Jammoa (EAOS Elementalist), an EAOS Conjurer, and Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

01:17:59 You speak into the microphone.

01:18:05 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."

01:18:07 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

01:18:10 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

01:18:21 Enter what?

01:18:29 You can't do that right now.

01:18:30 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

01:18:41 You can't do that right now.

01:18:50 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

01:18:55 You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

01:19:00 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

01:19:02 Two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend from the ceiling and close around Ather Jammoa (EAOS Elementalist). The sealed drop pod is quickly hauled into position at the launch tube, then disappears at a high rate of speed.

01:19:03 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

01:19:03 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:19:23 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

01:19:23 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:19:43 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

01:19:43 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You see Ather Jammoa (EAOS Elementalist) here.
You can go east.

01:19:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I know we are alotted only one application ship per liaison term, but is that based on when the application was submitted, or when the ship was purchased."

01:19:45 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour).

01:19:59 Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator:

01:19:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "When the application was submitted and approved or denied, I believe."

01:19:59 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (League Paladin).

01:20:25 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Application ship? What's that?"

01:20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah ok, because the new term starts in like an hour right? Was hoping ot hear back from them before then."

01:20:32 Ather Jammoa says, "Read the book."

01:20:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Ok everyone ready?"

01:20:40 Ather Jammoa says, "Waste of time to explain it now, let's move."

02:12:16 You speak into the microphone.

02:12:16 Johnathon Triggs says into the PA microphone, "Yep."

02:12:36 The aerial fortress suddenly fires its ascent thrusters, rocketing toward open space.

02:12:39 Johnathon Triggs switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

02:12:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident emerges from the lift.

02:12:48 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:12:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Thanks all! We lived!"

02:12:57 The vibrations of ascent start to ease off slightly as the aerial fortress moves into open space.

02:12:59 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

02:13:04 You grin.

02:13:04 Johnathon Triggs nods.

02:13:12 Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:13:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "A proposal will be put up shortly in the conference room. Please vote."

02:13:13 Johnathon Triggs says, "Yep."

02:13:17 At the top of its ascent, the aerial fortress gently comes into contact with "Daisy May" and the docking clamps snap into place.

02:13:18 Ather Jammoa moves up through the starship access tunnel.

02:13:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Will do."

02:13:31 You see a small purple ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a felo nest, a large octarine soldier felo kitten, a medium-sized red soldier felo, a normal white soldier felo, and a normal white soldier felo here.
Ather Jammoa is standing here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

02:13:32 [Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]

02:13:32 You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, Emmylou the humanoid service robot, a hefty octarine soldier felo kitten, an average-sized red felo, and an average-sized octarine soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go south and out.

02:13:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:13:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:13:35 Johnathon Triggs walks in from the south.

02:13:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:13:36 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:13:37 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:13:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:13:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We've blown up starships in protest, had a several day long protest in the streets, done broadcasts to try and reach the people and had non-binding resolutions. We haven't just been sitting around waiting for it to happen Jonathan."

02:13:39 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

02:13:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:13:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:13:41 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:13:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:13:44 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

02:13:44 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Daisy May! Welcome to home space!"
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:13:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:13:49 An average-sized octarine soldier felo marches south.

02:13:50 A hefty octarine soldier felo kitten stares curiously up at you.

02:13:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:13:51 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:13:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We were ven on strike for a while."

02:13:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Daisy May. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:13:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:14:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:47:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Even it doesn't involve SEAS it's just another excuse."

04:47:37 You nod.

04:47:59 Minor Change: Patrol missions now state in the room description if a room has been patrolled or not.

04:48:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So Morris says on General while we were killing Bari that he's not going to fund AEU. Well how oculd he in the first place."

04:48:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "How could he."

04:48:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Unless he's trying to refer to shunning us on stations."

04:48:57 You say, "That's probably what he's referring to."

04:49:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well Melinda did not tell us that we would be excluded in 285 though."

04:49:40 You nod.

04:49:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Only 288 and GMG and seems in 287 but I'm not worried about those."

04:50:22 You say, "Right. So Morris makes that comment and we're the ones accused of isolating ourselves."

04:50:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So i'll have to write to her if that's the case and ask her to allow us to build the Asteroid Station."

04:50:39 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:51:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because we did come to an agreement and I told her that I had no issues with allowing him on the station so now he's using this to his advantage."

04:51:29 You say, "Of course he is. That's what he does."

04:51:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Anyway, I don't want to jumpt to conclusions just yet."

04:51:41 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:52:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm just frustrated that I didn't check the power level of the Asteroid station when we went out there the other day so I'd know when the current one was going offline and when to expect the new deployment."

04:52:36 You say, "Oh, sorry. Yeah, we should have done that."

04:52:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah."

04:55:05 You say, "Yeah, I hope we get back on that."

04:55:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But if it comes down to it and we're squeezed too much, then I'll just have to tell Melinda that look, we've been cooperative and your people aren't and so if we're not added to the BAS, we'll build our own and if we're not added to at least the asteroid processor in 285, then we'll find our own cluster. This isn't what I want to do though."

04:55:48 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:56:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ironically, now Cats is contributing to the Salvage processor in 777. Imagine that! When they absolutely didn't want to before."

04:56:48 You say, "Yeah, I know."

04:56:56 You say, "They threw a hissy fit before."

04:57:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "It's all to do with we found the area and I know that so many are jealous of that since it is more alliance specific. Well then guys find a better place!"

04:58:05 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

04:58:30 You say to Lily, "And I can't imagine anything you would do to make me leave you."

04:58:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I honestly wouldn't car if were league or mutuality. We can't research Fringe Artifacts so otherwise I don't really care!"

04:59:08 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:59:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

05:00:08 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

05:01:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I guess you've been tested heh! Not that I wanted certain events to commence as they did..."

05:03:12 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

05:03:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.
