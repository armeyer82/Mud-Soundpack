Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed
pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender
silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple
and light purple cloth rug, and a personal hoverpallet here.

It has been so eexciting to be a part of this process Mister Gruffudd. To learn
the process see the inner workings of how a team like this operates, and to
figure out that the race we were studying were so much different than what
anyone could've expected. It was an honor. I am so glad it's something I can
give as a story to my friends, colleagues, all of that sort of thing.
What I do hope is that you and your loved ones, and friends can weather this
time well, and that you and the doctors can help Georgy. My thoughts are with
you.

I do hope Georgie will recover fully. I also look forward to revisiting in
future. While admittedly slightly disappointed with the short duration of our
stay, I fully understand that safety takes precedent. You can count on me to
volunteer for any future missions of this nature.

I so appreciate having had the opportunity to participate with this mission.
Although we always remain optimistic concerning expected results, we certainly
cannot predict outcomes based upon unknown factors. I am very impressed with how
EAOS and crew have managed throughout this operation. I hope for the best
recovery for Georgie and my thoughts are with him as he recovers. Thank you for
the invitation to participate. If I am available for future work on this
project, I will be honored to be involved.

Subject: Dropped out, Georgie is awake and symptomatic
Author: Morris Corlew
Posted: 14:55 30 April 2318 GST

At 11.78LTC traveled, we received a request from the Zéro Des Cartes crew that
we drop out of the rift. Once we had, we were told that Georgie was in their
control room. He now has an orange stalk coming from his head. We attempted to
reach Jim with no success. The sedation apparently is not working as well as it
was. He is requesting to return to Hwoom-Hoom. I asked that the crew there let
him know that our window for making it with charge is over and his request was
denied. We resumed course once we were informed that Mike had been able to get
him back into their dome and he was not violent. I also informed the other crew
that we will have a mandatory stop later today due to needing to charge. Any
additional information will be provided by the other crew in reply to this post.

Mike also informed us that the stalk was not contageous, yet.
As Morris stated, he was nonviolent, I was able to bring him back to the dome
peacefully.
It is my strongest recommendation that we send Georgie, and several members of
the FCI team home in a pod to A, limit exposure if it does become contageous,
and B, to prevent him or any future infected person from hindering our return to
alliance space. As pods have a few preprogrammed destination, their getting home
is assured.

Morris is account is true. I'll just give an acount of what happened on my end.
I was just hanging out in the Observation deck when Georgie asked us over the PA
system if we could help him in the control room. At first I went up there to
meet him, and Tobias and Goss came shortly after. But then I worried for a
moment and took Goss and Tobias into my group and insisted we put our suits on
just in case. So I put on my suit and we went back into the control room to
Georgie. He said he was trying to turn us around, but couldn't figure out how
the controlboard worked. He thinks we should go back. I told him to go back to
sleep, back to his dome, and we'd discuss going back once Jim or Ellen was
around. I hope we're not going back though. I was just trying to soothe him, and
convince him to go back to his dome. That stock growing out of his head was
disturbing. Johann took him to the docking bay where the dome was, and when we
got there, Mike and Johann and Georgie was there. After some attempts at
soothing him from Johann and I, Georgie didn't seem to be resistent, and Mike
was able to take him back to the dome.

I'd wait and see what jim and the team suggest. If I am correct they have a
biologist, an isolated dome and methods of locking it. I'm concerned that by
sending the Eaos crew off and separating them from us we're not only limiting
our resources, but also hurting Georgy's chance of survival.

Thought I would post this as an update for those who weren't alert. Jim has
informed us that Georgie is under heavier sedation and is also now physically
restrained. He's also stated that the other dome is much better equipped to take
care of him where they are than in an escape pod.

Subject: READ ME: QUARANTINE
Author: Wendy Arroyo
Posted: 15:59 30 April 2318 GST

Hi, hello. Due to the recent situation, both ships and all crew are schedule for
IMMEDIATE QUARANTINE upon arrival. We will not be landing anywhere else, and
will instead make for the quarantine station, which has been warned, as soon as
we're back in FTL range.

Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares
into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive
squid propels itself away from the starship.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap and a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a
FCI patch on the shoulder. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a
pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a
slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria. Her
face, both eyes, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says, "So yeah let's hope it's still contained."

You nod to Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says, "Morris kept saying send them back in a Pod and Jim said no and
so on so there was a bit of going back and forth on that one. At any rate, it
seems to be sorted but be prepared to go to Quarantine when we get back."

You nod to Lily Kaise. "YEah, that's what I gathered."

I know everyone has a lot of questions, and believe me, my team is doing its
best to draw what conclusions we can from the data we gathered. While it might
be tempting to believe we left in defeat, we did complete our primary
objectives. We confirmed the accuracy of the Outsider databanks. We discovered
who and what the Fwoof-Foom are. And we made contact... of a sort. In addition,
we got the first up close and personal look at an Outsider blockade station, as
well as the first kill of one, a feat that will stun the team back home. I will
ensure both crews receive due credit for that accomplishment.
If you feel we left in haste, I apologize. I have scouted many, many unexplored
planets, and lost friends and colleagues in the process. One of my primary
instructions to you all was, "Don't get greedy." We suffered a casualty almost
immediately upon making contact with this species. With our primary objectives
fulfilled, my gut told me it would be too risky to try for a bonus round. While
I've been nothing but impressed with the way these crews have conducted
themselves, it's also the case that none of you are trained in first contact or
survival on alien worlds. I didn't want to be responsible for any casualties
among you, especially when a couple of you began talking like you wanted to
follow in Georgie's footsteps.
I am told that Georgie is stable for now. He has been kept sedated and we aren't
sure how he'll progress. We don't know what affect the alien spores may have on
him. We hope the answer is "none," but given that we witnessed an Outsider with
one of those head stalks, I'm not willing to just assume that he'll be fine.
Whatever happens, we will be back. This was only the first step. Even if the
Fwoof-Foom will never be our allies, every world and every species has something
to teach us. When we come back, we'll be prepared. Forewarned is forearmed. We
will keep trying to achieve rational discourse with this species, and all of you
will have a place in that process, if you want it.
And once again, thank you. All of you.

A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all
directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the
depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The blast chamber begins warming up.

This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small

effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be
completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several
grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. Lights

in Mutuality space."
Morris Corlew asks, "2309?"
Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Lily says to Constantine, "Hey, you need to speak with Ather. It would probably
be best if you met in person but since we're not suggesting anyone board the
other ship at this time, just keep it in mind that you will likely want to speak
with Ather at some point."
Constantine Stone asks, "Yeah, you're probably right. Are you guys going to give
evidence against Janus?"
Constantine Stone asks, "Were you pilots back then?"
Constantine Stone says, "I guess Ather probably was."

drastic."

Constantine Stone says, "I mean in an ideal world they would listen to the
testimony of anyone who took part in the battle."

Ather's messenger."

Morris Corlew looks at Ryan Thomas and shrugs.
Morris Corlew says, "I get it. There's a reason our conference doors have locks
only we can open and why we have our own encrypted alliance channels. The
respect me thing though...was a bit bafflin. Figure she just meant respect the
situation though."
Morris Corlew says, "I mean...not like renouncin citizenship actually does any
good. It takes away their protections while leavin 'em open to government
demands. So I guess they have another plan they ain't ready to share with the
rest of us."

with you that wasn't ready for bein spread round to other alliances."
Constantine Stone says, "Maybe Ather has one."
Constantine Stone says, "I'll find out later I guess."
Morris Corlew says, "Hopefully somethin better'n renouncin citizenship."
Constantine Stone asks, "Is that just basically retirement?"
Morris Corlew says, "Gives the government the advantage and y'all nothin."
Morris Corlew says, "No...your contract would still stand as I understand it."

calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap and a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a

with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, and a neon purple wrist-mounted

Lily Kaise says, "Hes we sure would as I am so totally against the Rogue Navy."
Morris Corlew says, "Well...we've always wanted to support y'all. It's not
wantin to support Best that's caused the other stuff."
Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says, "Well yeah I'll be honst and say that I felt as though you
wanted to punish us for what our shithead parents did."
Morris Corlew says, "Nah."
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah I get that."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Morris Corlew says, "Some of our newer pilots thought that too. Since they
weren't there for the meetin we had back in December. But...it's never been
meant as a punishment to y'all."
Melinda Michaels says, "It wasn't the case though and I think us getting to talk
a bit on this trip is helping understanding on all sides."
Morris Corlew says, "It has to do with helpin Best make credits...and...we don't
want nothin to do with givin him a proverbial dime."
Melinda Michaels says, "We know Ather isn't happy with working with us but, who
cares. He's not the ruler of your alliance."
Lily Kaise says, "When we've really felt as though our hands were tied and trust
me if we can figure out ways to interfer with their process, to protest or to do
whatever it takes. I jsut believe most of us got really demoralized to some
extent."
Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.
Melinda Michaels nods.
Morris says to Lily, "I get that. And totally understand. Been there myself in
some situations."
Lily Kaise nods.
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says, "I really appreciate it when you all called me out the other
morning I've really been in a frump over this."
Melinda Michaels says, "We'll be around."
Morris Corlew says, "Well...political or diplomatic issues ain't got nothin to
do with personal relationships."
Lily Kaise says, "I am just so angry and well there are just no words to
describe it because this goes against everything."
Melinda Michaels nods to Lily Kaise.
Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah it's bad, for us all."
Morris Corlew says, "It is."
Lily Kaise says, "Such that I don't want to be a citizen of such a Government.
Still I feel as though I'm giving up my life."
Morris Corlew nods.
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says, "'Shule and I both feel this way."
Morris Corlew says, "I get that. It's your home and it's bein controlled by
somebody you see the harm of. I can only imagine...and I don't envy the position
y'all're in."
Lily Kaise says, "Ather probably has a free ticket to the Mutuality. We probably
have nothing."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Morris Corlew says, "Council ain't exactly his biggest fan."
-'Maybe, but he's one of the most experienced pilots around.
Say to whom?
Lily Kaise says, "Well you'd like to think so but they're not any of our biggest
fan and I don't blame them but they are next to impossible to deal with."
'Maybe, but he's one of the most experienced pilots around.
You say, "Maybe, but he's one of the most experienced pilots around."
Morris Corlew asks, "Wouldn't he have to go unreg without grand amnesty bein
applied if he did that? Unless Best negotiated on his behalf?"
'As for Lily and I, we feel we're expendible.
You say, "As for Lily and I, we feel we're expendible."
Lily Kaise says, "Naa if they offered him citizenshp, he could just go for it
but obviously under their terms. There's some different angles especially if
it's for political reasons."
Melinda Michaels says, "That's why you might want to rethink things."
Morris Corlew says, "Our government did it with Akemi...but there were a lotta
diplomatic issues that got our government movin on it."
Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
'My government probably feels I've out lived my usefulness as a pilot anyways.
You say, "My government probably feels I've out lived my usefulness as a pilot
anyways."
Morris Corlew looks at you thoughtfully.
Lily Kaise says, "Yep we definitely are expendable but I don't even feel that I
want to be a part of my own alliance anymore. I know that time will change
things and I seriously doubt Best will be able to serve another term but I jsust
dunno... after what happens to what's left of things while he is in office."
Morris Corlew asks, "Is his VP as much of a nutter as he is?"
Morris Corlew says, "Or wait."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Morris Corlew asks, "Do y'all have a VP?"
Morris Corlew says, "I'm terrible at extra-alliance government..."
Lily Kaise nods to Morris Corlew.
Lily Kaise says, "He can only serve three terms max but I doubt he will go
beyond this current one."
Morris Corlew says, "I mean...if I'da gotten a B in any kinda government but
that...my pa woulda ripped me a new hind end. But uh...that was just a section
in a few classes and uh..."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Lily Kaise nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Kinda ashamed of my lack of knowledge. Need to get some
books and stuff I guess."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your
shoulder.
Melinda Michaels grins.
Lily Kaise says, "Ours is supposed to be a democracy ike government as we have a
senate and house of ministers or such but each 'yeah I know what you mean. I
didn't set out to study politics myself."
Lily Kaise says, "Democracy-like I meant to say and we're divided up into
electoral regions which correspond to our various Worlds."
Morris Corlew nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, pretty much the same as ours."
Lily Kaise nods.
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says, "They call them regions and each has it's own number of votes
and so on."
Morris Corlew says, "I know uh...is it League Reform? one of our parties...is
lookin to make representation a bit more similar to the AEU system. One of the
reasons I need to learn more bout it."
Morris Corlew says, "Our system is sadly very Earth-centric."
Lily Kaise nods.
Morris Corlew says, "That's somethin I agree with 'em on. But...some of their
other policies they've had and the rumors...well...gives me great pause."
An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the
fog.
Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."
Melinda Michaels stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue
cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown
velvet throw pillow on it.
Melinda Michaels says, "Be back."
Melinda Michaels strides south.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on your shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes
slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
A nearby soldier carefully inspects his rifle to ensure it is ready.
Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for
protection.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your
shoulder.
Morris says to you, "She's tryin to get your ear."
Lily Kaise laughs.
grin morris 'YEah, I can see that.
You grin at Morris Corlew. "YEah, I can see that."
Lily looks over at ASteria snd says git 'im.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Morris Corlew grins.
laugh lily
You laugh at Lily Kaise.
Morris Corlew gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.
Morris Corlew says, "Smooch by proxy."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise says, "Right on."
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Lily Kaise says, "Great speed but too bad we've not encountered any storms thus
far."
Morris Corlew nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Was a couple days fore we saw our first one comin out too."
Lily Kaise says, "True."
'That's true.
You say, "That's true."
Morris Corlew says, "Least we got good speed. Comin out...them first couple days
were kinda sucky."
Lily Kaise asks, "So I feel really remis but I never really got the general
total LTC we traveled to the site?"
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Morris Corlew asks, "Um...somethin like 140?"
Lily Kaise says, "Ok."
Morris Corlew says, "Mel's got the total for sure. Might ask her."
A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.
Lily Kaise says, "I knew it was in the neighborhood of between 1000 to 1200
Light-Years but didn't think we traveled 1200 Light-Years."
Morris Corlew nods.
Lily Kaise says, "So 140 LtC sounds about right."
nod
You nod.
Morris Corlew says, "Was somewhere tween 130 and 140. But...I was real lax on
countin it up too."
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says, "Well we got there that's all that matters. Nobody can chart or
nobody has a chart which covers this far out either even in rimward unless you
ahve that big huge one from across the Skim or Anfisa's huge Spinward."
Morris Corlew says, "The big one of Anfisa's might, but the other one certainly
wouldn't."
Lily Kaise nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Lose that probably round 40 on the long-range NDB."
Lily Kaise says, "Well the one across the skim did cover up to the nebula that
time."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Morris Corlew asks, "That nebula's inside Torus NDB range, ain't it?"
Lily Kaise says, "Hmm good question I don't remember and we traveled in Nissi's
Combat Carrier which I don't think can have a Long-Range nDB."
Morris Corlew nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Yeah. And its regular NDB is from the Torus. And that ends
fore you even get to Mutuality space or real close to it."
Lily Kaise nods.
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Morris Corlew says, "Actually, it might have a long-range."
Morris Corlew says, "Oooh. We got new cadets."
Lily Kaise says, "Yep we have some new ones in aEU too and I really don't want
to abandon them."
Morris Corlew nods.
Morris Corlew says, "They could use some guidance."
Morris Corlew says, "All cadets can."
Morris Corlew nudges you suggestively.
Morris Corlew says, "That guy helped me a lot when I was a cadet."
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.
The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing
that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless
desert plain is all around.
Lily Kaise says, "Yep we've been working with the ones we've had lately and
there are a couple very promising ones and a couple of... well there's some in
every crowd."
Lily Kaise laughs.
nod
You nod.
Morris Corlew grins.
Morris Corlew says, "Yeah. We get our fair share, so does the Fringe."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your
shoulder.
'I'm not sure I was  very promising when I was a cadet.
You say, "I'm not sure I was very promising when I was a cadet."

You chuckle.
Morris Corlew says, "I probably wasn't either. But...I made it."
'Thankfully that was only about a week or two. Even after that, I took a while
to really get my feet under me.
You say, "Thankfully that was only about a week or two. Even after that, I took
a while to really get my feet under me."
Morris Corlew nods.
Lily Kaise grins at you.
Morris Corlew says, "Yep. Same kinda deal."
'But out of the ffive or so cadets that became pilots around the same time I
did, I'm the only one that's still here.
You say, "But out of the ffive or so cadets that became pilots around the same

Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
'It's sad. The rest either resigned or were imprisoned.
You say, "It's sad. The rest either resigned or were imprisoned."
Morris Corlew says, "Tryin to remember who became a cadet round the time I
did...Ted, Eve...Melissa uh...Cantrelle? Who's now retired."
Morris Corlew says, "Bunch that never made it outta cadethood."
nod
You nod.
Morris Corlew chuckles. "There was the Fringe guy...the 80-some year old that I
managed to majorly offend my first night at the spaceport."
chuckle
You chuckle.
Morris Corlew says, "He kept goin on bout how could his government allow the
other alliances to get better trade deals. Badmouthin the Fringe government. I
told him that probably wasn't a good idea."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that's the way. It's amazing how much is spent on pilot
training and they get here and are gone in a week or two."
Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.
Morris Corlew says, "That guy hung round for hmm...over a year? We've had a few
like that. Show up from time to time."
Lily Kaise says, "H yeah we have too."
Morris Corlew asks, "Oh uh...what was that guy's name. Real weird one. Raiyoku?"
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that was one."
Lily Kaise says, "We've had at least a couple though."
Morris Corlew nods.
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Morris Corlew asks, "Whatever happened to that guy's got y'all's whip office?"
Lily Kaise says, "Heh yeah, I keep hoping a new pilot will run for it."
Morris Corlew nods.
The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,
"How goes the blackwing? Everyone okay over there? With all your tasty food, and
drinks, and..."
The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift
comm, saying, "And Tegan!"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your

Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"We're good."
Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.
You say over the linked rift comm, "We're alive and kicking... I think."
Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue

velvet throw pillow on it.
Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"How're things on the Frenchy ship?"
The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Well don't kick Morris in the antler. I don't think medical can fix those."
Lily Kaise says, "Then Ather stole my thunder when I was trying to encourage
Casen and says oh we really don't need a whip. Well as a newer pilot I learned a
lot by holding that office a term."
Morris Corlew says, "Oy."
Lily Kaise nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "Why do people listen to him."
The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Not bad here. Everything is still stable."
Morris Corlew says, "No idea."
Morris Corlew sighs.
Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Awesome."
With a jerk and a rumble, the ship slows down.
Lily Kaise says, "Well as you all know, I don't just wag my tail and follow
along which is whey we don't always get along."
Lily Kaise laughs.
-melinda When I was in my first year of piloting, everyone told me that Ather
was our ace and pretty much told me tolisten to him.
You say to Melinda, "When I was in my first year of piloting, everyone told me
that Ather was our ace and pretty much told me tolisten to him."
Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"And we have Torus NDB."
Morris Corlew exclaims, "Woo!"
The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Woo."
Melinda Michaels says, "I have a story."
Morris Corlew says, "Also in local space."
Melinda Michaels says, "Always have a story."
Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.
Lily Kaise grins.
Morris says to Melinda, "I like stories."
'It's story  time?
You ask, "It's story time?"
Melinda Michaels says, "There was this one time in a meeting."
Melinda Michaels says, "I could have agreed with two pilots, one being our ace."
Melinda Michaels says, "Who usually has good ideas."
Melinda Michaels says, "While this idea wasn't a bad one they brought forth."
Melinda Michaels says, "At the time it could have, I felt, muddied the waters."
Melinda Michaels says, "So I opposed."
Melinda Michaels asks, "Guess what happened?"
Morris glances between Lily and you.
Lily Kaise nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "People followed and the opposition won."
Melinda Michaels says, "Point here is."
Melinda Michaels says, "If you think you've got ideas, don't let anyone squash
you just because they are an ace."
Lily Kaise nods.
Morris Corlew says, "An ace is an ace because they've fought and been an asset
durin a time of war...maybe they can fly...maybe they got name recognition. But
it don't mean you got all the answers all the time and everybody just gotta
follow ya."
Lily Kaise says, "Oh that is a given."
'I agree. I don't see eye to eye on most things with Ather. Even when it comes
to combat.
You say, "I agree. I don't see eye to eye on most things with Ather. Even when
it comes to combat."
chuckle
You chuckle.
Lily Kaise grins at you.
Morris Corlew says, "Except Ather's so often been treated like he's got all the
answers to all the questions and can do no wrong. Cept...that just ain't true."
Lily says to you, "Well your experience is more current too."
Morris Corlew says, "Ain't true of any human."
Melinda Michaels says, "He's treated like that because, thus far, people let it
stay that way."
Morris Corlew nods.
Lily Kaise nods.
Morris Corlew says, "When I was a new pilot, I fell into that too. This person
is an ace or a veteran...their word is law. Well...it really don't work
thataway."
'Nah, it doesn't. After people told me that, 'i actually started to challenge
some of his ideas that he taught people. Even when it came to combat. My
strategy works for me. His works for him.
You say, "Nah, it doesn't. After people told me that, 'i actually started to
challenge some of his ideas that he taught people. Even when it came to combat.
My strategy works for me. His works for him."
Melinda says to you, "What's your strategy."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your
shoulder.
Lily Kaise says, "As I say i've never totally followed ather. I listen to what
he says but I've actually sort of... put him in his place a couple of times and
he doesn't like it very well but so be it."
Morris Corlew nods.
-melinda Depends on what I'm fighting.
You say to Melinda, "Depends on what I'm fighting."
'And what I'm fithing in.
You say, "And what I'm fithing in."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Lily Kaise says, "I could never get him to apologize to the Mutuality though."
grin
You grin.
Morris Corlew says, "And he expects 'em to capitulate and rescue is hind end."
Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.
-lily I don't think he knows the meaning of apologize.
You say to Lily, "I don't think he knows the meaning of apologize."
Morris Corlew says, "His."
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.
Lily Kaise says, "Yup go figure."
Lily Kaise says, "Oh he doesn't."
Morris Corlew says, "I really think he expects the Council'll just roll over.
'Anythin for you, Ather.'"
Lily Kaise says, "But had he done so, we might have made some progress over
there."
Morris Corlew says, "But I honestly think the Council's smarter'n that."
Lily Kaise nods. "They are."
nod
You nod.
A truck on a converging path swings onto the main road just ahead of the ship.
The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift

You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.
You say over the linked rift comm, "I was going straight too. Straight to hell
if I don't change my ways."
Lily Kaise says, "So this is my plan. I will wait and see what they do to us for
participating with this Expedition. They really didn't tell us we couldn't but
that doesn't mean they won't act merely from the other alliances and I will not
support the Rogue Navy so I think you can read clearly between the lines.because
they can. I do want to observe the political fallout."
Morris Corlew grins at you.
The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Shule, you're so passed hell there's no going back."
Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship,
but it swerves aside at the last moment.
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Morris Corlew says, "Probably due for a repair stop soon. Been nearly 25LTC
since our last stop for reps."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.
Melinda Michaels strides south.
Lily Kaise nods.
Morris Corlew says, "My guess'd be us. Um...was nearly 18 fore our stop, then
22.5 for theirs. So uh...been over 50 LTC since our drive last broke."
Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.
Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue
cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown
velvet throw pillow on it.
Morris Corlew says, "No sorry...under 50. But not by much."

Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to
mist.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.

A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly out.
Bolts of lightning crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic
crater.
A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the
back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through
deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.
The snow underfoot grows more shallow, with a thick rough surface of ice just
underneath.
One of the group falls down into the snow. Others struggle past, too exhausted
to help.
The city slowly grows nearer... too slowly.
The group slowly struggles closer to the city.
The swirling snowflakes thin out a little.
The group arrives at the outskirts of the city. It is frozen and windswept, and
no smoke rises from the chimneys. Some of the group cry out in dismay, dropping
to their knees in despair as the snow flies more thickly, obscuring your vision.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.
The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.
A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through
into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place
isn't right.
Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.
You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.
You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night.
Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes
slowly.

creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate
from the reactionless drive.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Ali Candan: "Repairs."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
[PA] Keegan Wantz, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec: "We were at about 17 LTC
when you dropped us, aye Ali?"
[PA] Ali Candan: "Not completely repaired yet. I'll post it."
[PA] Keegan Wantz, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec: "Anyone else awake for
internal reps?"
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new

Many people march by on the shore, whipped and tormented by demons.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the
back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through

A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly
emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the
dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.
An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of
machine-gun fire.

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed
pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender

You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.
Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the
entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship

clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

We were able to do so much for the League in that time, so I strongly disagree
with your assessment.  The Conservatives don't see a need to fix what isn't
broken, and the League has continued to grow steadily in these last years under
our guidance while others have faltered.  We have a tried and true track record

You peer east...
[EAOS Quarantine Facility; Bio-Contaminant Visitation Lobby]
At first this appears to simply be an extremely large room, but careful
observation reveals that it is bisected by some kind of almost invisible barrier
at a black line on the floor and ceiling. Sound appears to pass through it, but
objects are stopped. Touching the barrier gives no sensation, only the fact that
your hand does not go beyond it reveals it exists at all. Several chairs are
arranged on both halves of the room, with a door on the opposite side of the
barrier leading northwest to the station proper, while a door this side leads
west to the main gathering area.
On the other side, you see Souleater the little striped orange CatBot and Ninja
the little black CatBot here.

You peer east...
[EAOS Quarantine Facility; Bio-Contaminant Visitation Lobby]
At first this appears to simply be an extremely large room, but careful
observation reveals that it is bisected by some kind of almost invisible barrier
at a black line on the floor and ceiling. Sound appears to pass through it, but
objects are stopped. Touching the barrier gives no sensation, only the fact that
your hand does not go beyond it reveals it exists at all. Several chairs are
arranged on both halves of the room, with a door on the opposite side of the
barrier leading northwest to the station proper, while a door this side leads
west to the main gathering area.
On the other side, you see Souleater the little striped orange CatBot, LuLu the
old average-sized red bald felo, and Ninja the little black CatBot here.
Tobias Hawthorne, Kani Kahakai, Cheri Lindbergh, Morris Corlew, Melinda
Michaels, Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft, Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys, Wendy

Noah."

anything without worrying about being overheard, since we're most likely being
monitored."

peer e
You peer east...
[EAOS Quarantine Facility; Bio-Contaminant Visitation Lobby]
At first this appears to simply be an extremely large room, but careful
observation reveals that it is bisected by some kind of almost invisible barrier
at a black line on the floor and ceiling. Sound appears to pass through it, but
objects are stopped. Touching the barrier gives no sensation, only the fact that
your hand does not go beyond it reveals it exists at all. Several chairs are
arranged on both halves of the room, with a door on the opposite side of the
barrier leading northwest to the station proper, while a door this side leads
west to the main gathering area.
On the other side, you see Ninja the little black CatBot, a small Bari-shaped
tidbit, Nicolette the little calico CatBot, and Fuzzball the average-sized onyx
long-haired felo here.
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn, Evenia Callseah, and Morris Corlew are here.

when I saw ears...I forgot all about it and tossed myself at him. Turns out if
you run into that thing at high speed, it hurts."

would be nice. This just...feels wrong."

itch like hell."
Katina says to Evenia, "You've been to prison?"
"Yeah." Evenia Callseah looks at Katina Faye and shrugs. "There was an invasion
and smart little me just ran out of the apartment...completely naked."
Katina Faye giggles.

extremely paranoid something bad was going to happen on way back."

of goin places that're totally new."

be in charge of it."
Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Like what if you tell people to get the hell out of there
just a little too late?"
Morris Corlew says, "Even more I mean."
Evenia Callseah says, "Next time though. The crew of the other ship can have
the...whoever gets infected with whatever on their ship. That was like. double
extra stress."

the places being totally new? You mean like a newly formed planet?"

back."

Morris says to Cheri, "Someplace that's familiar to other folks but new to me
has a certain thrill...but the thrill of somplace no other human till then's
ever been is an even bigger thrill."

ship and I felt like a complete dumbass. It was stupid."

I was already backing away from sphere when Jim told us to run."

Morris Corlew says, "I uh...got too much curiosity."
Aisling says to Cheri, "Sphere told us."
Cheri Lindbergh asks, "I remember Ellen said something, then Ather, then Pierre.
But who gave the first permission?"

outsider. and I basically felt like my feet were glued there."

outta the ships?"

radio."

everything else. I hated realizing it."

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Overtaken by the mushrooms."
Morris Corlew grins.
Morris Corlew wriggles his fingers.
Evenia Callseah shudders.
Katina says to Pierre-Louis, "Sporific."
Evenia Callseah says, "You know how sometimes you have the most...pointless
thoughts at the wrong times? When I saw that outsider, all I could think was,
"Thank fuck I don't have tentacles, thank fuck I don't have tentacles.""
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Aisling the Fox says, "By the time Outsider came in I had a good idea what was
going on."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "I feel like somebody should have just said no, we have to
see if the environment is good or something like that."
Evenia Callseah says, "So if I ever. Talk about getting tentacles again. Someone
remind me of when I was staring at an outsider. Realizing how fucking glad I was
I didn't do it."
Morris Corlew says, "I uh...wanted to say yes."
Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.
Katina says to Morris, "If Pierre said to remove all coverings, would you say
yes?"
Katina Faye smirks at Morris Corlew.
Morris says to Katina, "No. Pierre ain't no alien."
Katina says to Morris, "I see."
Evenia Callseah says, "Pierre is not the sphere though. The sphere. It's
suggestions. It's words..."
Aisling the Fox asks, "So you would trust unknown alien creature more than
Pierre?"
Morris Corlew grins. "I mean...he's alien...he just ain't -an- alien."
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Morris Corlew says, "It ain't bout trust."
Morris Corlew says, "It's bout curiosity."
Evenia Callseah says, "It...wasn't trust."
Evenia Callseah nods.
Aisling the Fox says, "I am guessing you do not use condoms much."
Morris Corlew says, "I still would love to be able to talk to Georgie. Find out
what this experience has actually felt like...been like for him."
Evenia Callseah says, "But in a way...I feel like I was also tempted to think
that way. by the sphere. I'm naturally curious. but I'm not stupid. So...The
fact that I wanted to do it. tells me there was more going on."
Katina says to Aisling, "Whuh?"
Morris Corlew says, "And no. It's not about trust. I never trusted that thing.
But curiosity was higher'n trust. And caution was higher'n curiosity."
Morris says to Evenia, "The fact you didn't do it..."
Ather Jammoa shakes his head.
Aisling says to Katina, "He was ready to remove everything for curiosity sake.
Was joke."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "It wasn't the sphere that made me want to go out there."

readily accessible."

Evenia Callseah nods to Ather Jammoa. "Right."
Morris Corlew says, "Got three packages, only one I know what it is. The other
two're probably payback from Eve."

helped me in here. I hardly even noticed all the pinching poking and prodding. I
just wanted coffee."

others who were not on trip, but why can we not have communicators?"

Morris Corlew says, "Me too, mostly."
Katina says to Morris, "Okay."
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Aisling the Fox says, "Yes, right. Keep us from going around and fucking those
not in contact with spores. But why not let us talk on comms? We can talk to
visitors. Seems stupid."
Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.
Morris Corlew says, "Would love to have my phone for the newsreader."
Evenia Callseah says, "Because I totally understand the need for us to not have
physical contact, but...Let us have something. yes we've got that phone here,
but it's not exactly...private. some contact with the worlds out there would be
nice."
Aisling leans back on her beanbag chair and flails her arms haplessly.

length off the bottom of the gown. but..."

lot of paper."

down."

too."

is physically ugly, except maybe to another such-looking person."

room and then started makin comments."

Ather Jammoa says, "There is no pretty much. It definitely is her fault."
Evenia Callseah says, "Sure, but it's still not okay for people to be rude about
it. At least behind her back. Say it to the woman's face."
Cheri Lindbergh says, "So would it be better if she just said Hey Brunhilda, you
ugly."
Morris Corlew says, "But if you're gonna be a jerk to somebody, do it to their
face instead of just behind their back."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that is my point."
Ather Jammoa says, "I'm rude about it and do say it to her face."
Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.
Lily Kaise says, "Right."
Cheri Lindbergh nods to Evenia Callseah. "That's what I meant."
nod
You nod.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "She did drink the vial, but there was a
slight chance to have an effect that would have looked good."
Kani Kahakai says, "Her request was that people not treat her any different than
before."
Kani Kahakai says, "So I have kept ignoring her mostly."
Morris Corlew says, "That's what I told Ari."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Morris Corlew nods to Kani Kahakai.
Aisling the Fox says, "Ehhh."
Kani Kahakai says, "She was pretty clear about not wanting people around her
when I first met her."
Evenia Callseah says, "The thing is. It made her happy to do it. If it made my
friend happy to get 6 arms and 4 heads. I support that friend."
Ather nods at Aisling in agreement.
Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, she's who she is, what are you going to do? It's
her fate not ours."
Morris Corlew says, "Anyway, he shouldn'ta called her a cunt, but he did have a
point. She was bein a jerk."
Lily Kaise nods.
Evenia Callseah says, "It's...not that she doesn't want people around."
Aisling the Fox says, "When you go off and do something fucking stupid that
makes you puke bile up everywhere, I do not think you are in position to demand
everyone "treat you like before.""
Ather Jammoa grins at Aisling the Fox.
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that was her choice and she has to live with it."
Morris glances at Evenia out of the corner of his eye.
Morris Corlew shrugs.
nod
You nod.
Evenia Callseah says, "She does that, because it's like...It's her wall. She
shows people that fuck off side. But it's so that people don't get close to
her."
Morris Corlew says, "Sometimes there's other issues too. I just...think it was
kinda rude of her. She's like that a lot though."
Ather Jammoa says, "There are other ways of projecting an aura of "fuck off".
Look at me, I have no friends."
Ather Jammoa says, "And it works."
Aisling the Fox looks at Ather Jammoa thoughtfully.
Aisling the Fox says, "That is a lie."
Ather says to Aisling, "You're the pesky sister."
Evenia Callseah says, "Becoming Brunhilda's friend was...A battle. But I saw
that front for what it was, so I worked at it."
Cheri says to Pierre-Louis, "Ather is not your friend."
Aisling the Fox asks, "And Pierre?"
Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Pierre is my pal!"
Ather Jammoa says, "Not my friend."
Aisling the Fox says, "Pal is friend."
Ather says to Aisling, "Prove it."
Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "It is!"
Evenia Callseah shrugs. "I'm just saying she's more than you first see."
Aisling the Fox says, "Well I do not exactly have dictionary with me at the
moment."
Kani Kahakai says, "Ather is a cold, unfeeling machine."
Ather says to Aisling, "I know. That's why you can't prove it."
Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.
Aisling says to Evenia, "She and I used to be friends. I liked her. But she
became mean and distant."
Cheri says to Evenia, "I actually liked her before, but I'm so shallow it's just
too hard to talk to her now."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Hard times."
Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "I didn't mind if she was mean and distant!"
Cheri Lindbergh says, "I'm limited in accepting things."
Evenia Callseah says, "What mostly kicked the off, was her galleon."
Aisling the Fox says, "Something in her changed before she literally changed."
Kani Kahakai says, "Some people don't like bugs or crawly things, or ants if
you're Morris."
Evenia Callseah coughs. "That."
Kani Kahakai says, "I don't like body horror, squicks me out."

Kani Kahakai says, "Brain fungus bad."
Evenia gives Morris a small glance out of the corner of her eye.
Cheri says to Evenia, "So did this change her even more in her personality and
such?"
Morris Corlew says, "I just don't think it's productive for everybody to act
horrified and talk behind her back and whatnot. I dunno. I guess for me it was
just another example of Ari bein Ari. And Hawthorn seemed to get her attention."
Evenia Callseah says, "Anyway, tell it to her face is mostly my point. She's a
big girl."
Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah.
Ather Jammoa says, "She did actually use to be decent peoples, but like others,
the change really shifted my opinion of her."

You nod to Evenia Callseah.
Lily Kaise nods to Evenia Callseah.
Morris Corlew says, "She acted the same before she did it. How she acts ain't

Ather Jammoa says, "And pukes weird liquids."
Morris Corlew says, "She looks like how she's been actin."
Lily Kaise says, "I would honestly be afraid to come into contact with what she
vomits too."
Katina cringes.
Lily Kaise nods.
Cheri Lindbergh says, "I didn't see it a lot, but I don't think she gets it on
anybody."
Evenia says to Cheri, "Not really. But she was getting gradually more...distant
since her galleon. I was about 90% sure she was gonna retire after it. but she
didn't."
Morris Corlew says, "It does gross me out. But...reactin I think'll end up doin
more harm."
Lily Kaise says, "It's sad actually though very sad."

to like...wish it luck in it's future. they'd kiss it before sending it on it's
way."

receiver of the letter would have no idea what ou did?"

you yelling? You are sitting right here."
Melinda Michaels beams.

Ather Jammoa says, "I might relish eating and/or drinking something which I hvae
not eaten and/or drank in a while, but I won't overly obsess."
Evenia says to Ather, "My day doesn't begin without at least, 3 cups of good
coffee. It's in my vanes."
"How about fuck me sideways and up-side-down?" Evenia Callseah looks at Katina
Faye and shrugs.
Katina blushes crimson.
Ather Jammoa says, "Then you have more pressing concerns, likely that need to be
