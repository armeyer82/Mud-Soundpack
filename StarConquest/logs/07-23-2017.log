00:00:24 Several people at a table nearby argue quietly in French.

00:01:24 The music fades away, but after a few moments a new song starts up with a soft blare of the horns and a thumping bass beat.

00:04:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:04:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok Constantine, be careful as you do need an AEU. The Fringe suit is rather ineffective as you can generally only kill Bari with Plasma and Lasers."

00:04:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I only meant that I couldn't find someone else to bring an AEU."

00:04:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I had to do it, and we didn't have two EAOS as a result."

00:04:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And yeah it was a lot slower with the fringe suit."

00:05:24 Smooth jazz plays quietly in the background with a soulful clarinet improvising on the melody.

00:05:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:05:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I would actually recommend that you forego the operation because destroyed battlesuits do affect the conquest. You managed though and of course, you can always just launch out if someone is very damaged and let the fort repair. It costs a bit in supplies but that works."

00:06:24 A mournful sax solo swells above the smooth jazz playing over the restaurant's sound system.

00:06:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident finishes off a cup of coffee with maple syrup and cream.

00:06:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a cup in a midnight blue trash bin.

00:07:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Plus I really need the mining money."

00:07:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:07:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "How did you repair though with no aEU?"

00:07:24 A young waiter clad in black moves quietly about, clearing tables of dishware.

00:07:43 You say, "He brought the AEu."

00:07:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I meant that I wanted to bring my EAOS, but to do that I needed to find someone else to bring an AEU. I couldn't find anyone, so I brought the AEU."

00:07:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:07:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh oh no problem then."

00:07:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And that's why we had one EAOS and one Fringe instead of two EAOS."

00:08:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

00:09:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:09:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Against that is."

00:10:24 A mournful sax solo swells above the smooth jazz playing over the restaurant's sound system.

00:10:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah I guess even a rental would be better for sonics."

00:10:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:10:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

00:10:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do lasers work better against bari than whatever weapons the fringe suits use>."

00:10:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Even lasers aren't great."

00:11:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:11:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes Lasers and Plasma are the best with Plasma being the best but it's a real energy drain."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

09:33:51 You're already lying down.

09:33:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, c

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

15:41:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, well, I suppose that is what I will feel once I have taken it all in, and I don't think I even know all the facts."

15:42:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eli."

15:42:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ather and Eli were made rogue and all of us were removed from office."

15:43:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I did not even think a rogue ace pilot existed. That is, just in 1 word, bad!"

15:44:28 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

15:44:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:44:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Just because Vernos was unhappy that he wasn't invited on a trip which served to help some other humanity. He destroys the lifelong careers of our two best pilots."

15:44:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Join all the rogues."

15:45:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Just because he was not happy?"

15:45:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So Vernos is now Voice."

15:46:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Pretty much. He claims he would've done it regardless, but his reaction clearly shows that he's being a whiny child because he wasn't invited to go."

15:46:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly."

15:47:20 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "300."

15:47:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:47:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Especially too that he likely only fabricated his story as I doubt he even knew the true facts."

15:47:42 You nod.

15:47:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:47:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm surprised they didn't at least investigate his claim before they took such punative action."

15:48:20 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Ok, thanks, I will want two but I am at the bubble."

15:48:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't know about anyone else, but the war taught me to never ignore the distress call of anyone that you're not currently at war with."

15:49:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:49:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes, this is what I was taught in the academy as well."

15:50:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "So, if it means becoming a rogue pilot but beingable to stick to what few morals I have left, I'm good with it!"

15:50:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I would agree with you, Ather."

15:50:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, I don't know what exactly happened, what cry of help you answered, but the timing was not particularly good to start with."

15:51:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But that fucking twit who claims that he represents the alliance (Vernos0 prefers to compare Eli and I to the slavers for our actions."

15:51:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "To the slavers? For helping someone?"

15:51:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah."

15:52:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I mean, you are talking about a cry for help, right? How does that compare to trading slaves?"

15:52:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I dunno."

15:52:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

15:53:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Maybe cause the parts we used to help them with were supposedly stolen."

15:53:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:53:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes he kept claiming this."

15:54:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:54:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Then the other day he did something with pirates in 777 which is questionable although I'm not exactly certain what happened. So this is a cover-up for his own mis-deeds."

15:54:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Assuming the parts were stolen, they would've probably been stolen from the League, so there was no violated AEU alliance law whatsoever."

15:55:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Supposedly stolen parts?"

15:55:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But everything is supposition at best right now."

15:56:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:56:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Right as neither you nor Eli provided anything right, just assistance with repairs or did you both just go along and the parts were provided and the unreggeds sid their own repairs?"

15:56:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The unregs did indeed do their own repairs, and we got no profit whatsoever from the parts."

15:56:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Tr 1 so if there were any issues it should have been amongst League and not the AEU."

15:56:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops."

15:57:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:57:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So if there were any issues it should have been amongst League government with their own pilots and not the AEU."

15:57:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "One would think."

15:58:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm still incidentally, offerring a 1 billion credit bounty for every proven ship of Vernos that anyone destroys So, go to it!"

15:58:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What, we are destroying Vernos's ships to punish him?"

15:59:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am, I don't know about you."

15:59:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:59:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What are the consequences Ather? It means we're attacking one of our own though? Or how serious is this as both Shule and I were ready to hunt him down yesterday as we were fairly certain we knew where he was."

16:00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We would most likely be rogued for it, no?"

16:00:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Who can know? Could range from nothing to being rogued, ot having your license revoked if you're in the AEU. So, you should know what you're undertaking."

16:00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am not sure destroying AEU ships, still belonging to our government, just to get to him, is a solution. But if I have a word with him I will definitely put him under some pressure."

16:00:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah which is why I said no even though we'd be serving jusice."

16:00:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Justice."

16:00:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Your concern is so noted. However, I will still do what I must."

16:01:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I can understand that for you its a matter of honour."

16:01:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:01:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Same here."

16:01:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyone who wants to make a few billion can joi nin the effort!"

16:02:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:02:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's too bad that as a station owner we just can't go flip the power switches on certain temporary stations at times."

16:02:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:02:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

16:02:40 You chuckle at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

16:02:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, at least you hinted at the places where he frequents, thanks for that."

16:03:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:03:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

16:04:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:04:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "By the way Ather, how much for an unneutered cutting of the Double-Laser plant? We do have the funds."

16:04:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Very expensive, very expensive."

16:04:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:04:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm sure."

16:04:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And I can't get it to you until later today, but we'll say 2.5 billion."

16:04:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:04:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So send me a letter if you don't want to state it here."

16:04:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

16:05:08 You say, "That's pocket change for our org."

16:05:10 You grin.

16:05:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know it will be a lot but we'll do it."

16:05:21 You say, "And if not, I'll help pay for it."

16:05:27 You say, "He said 2.5 bill."

16:06:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That price is non-negotiable!"

16:06:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:06:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's fine Ather. We are fine with this sum. Please also let us know which other plants you can offer and their respective pricing as well. I don't know how many we can accomodate yet as our command isn't that high."

16:06:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "K."

16:07:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:07:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We'll probably be back this evening. I have pulled most of my ships and assets out of New Earth so my pulsar is on The Torus so will need to figure out a way to pick up the plant when it's ready."

16:07:53 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 181,468.07 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

16:08:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, you'll need to go to New Earth regardless, so you can put the plant into its shell."

16:12:31 You grin.

16:12:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

16:13:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps that's a bit steep but I did tell them that we wouldn't openly market cuttings but if anyone asks us for a cutting, it is to be neutered and we will sell them if they are available but the first priority goes to Org members."

19:19:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. Interestingly, I think my repair abilities in tryin to save Mel that got interrupted helped as I was able to catch a few more interrupts myself."

Citizens and tourists alike stroll along, admiring the scenery and occasionally glancing upward at the sound of trilling bird calls in the trees.
