03:23:51 You grab a large rubber stamp, pound it onto the 00:00 05/10 AEU space defense report, then fling the document into the Outgoing pile.

03:23:54 I see no "report" here.

03:23:56 You briefly open the door to leave.

You can go north, up, and out.

03:23:57 You can't go that way.

03:23:57 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

03:23:57 You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

03:24:01 You key in a transport of Deadly Strike to your location.

03:24:01 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:24:01 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:24:02 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a letter here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:24:02 Board what?

03:24:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:24:04 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:24:06 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:24:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:24:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:24:16 There are no other ships in the sector.

03:24:18 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

03:24:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:24:22 Which sector did you mean?

03:24:22 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

03:24:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:24:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:24:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:24:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:24:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:24:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:24:31 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:24:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

03:24:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:24:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:24:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:24:36 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:24:37 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

03:24:38 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:24:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:24:41 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:24:59 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 546" has jumped into the sector.

03:25:02 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 546! Welcome to home space!"

03:25:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:25:07 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:25:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:25:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:25:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:25:22 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:25:23 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:25:24 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

03:25:24 You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:25:25 You exit the ship.

19:35:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "So... I find myself in a state of confusion. I notice mentions of a bari infestation being irradicated, congratulations on that, I took it upon myself to do some research and have to ask, do bari attack human lifeforms?"

19:36:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "I think some of them might. But I"ve only seen them while in my battlesuit before."

19:36:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Hello, by the way! You're a new voice."

19:37:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Thank you, darling' I'm relatively new. I took a break from pilotting for a month or two as father requested my presence at a meeting."

19:37:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I am ashamed to say I have not encountered bari, though that may be a blessing."

19:37:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Well, welcome back."

19:38:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "I haven't seen them outside of the station in our space which is dealing with an infestation. That's likely what you read about..."

19:39:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I did. I shall steer clear for now. My combat experience is... limitted, bar a few brushes in space."

19:39:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Have you done any battlesuit work?"

19:41:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Not yet. I intended to do some before my... absence. but alas, never got round to it. I must unpack now, and get this ship back in order, *the sound of crash and then a smash*, as you can no doubt here, it's rather a mess. Alas, engineers are not the kindest of fellows. Anyway. I may dip into it later."

19:41:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "*giggle*."

19:42:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Well, good luck. It doesn't sound very much fun, but I suppose it's necessary."

23:16:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "There's a message beacon in new earth space transmitting an... interesting message."

23:18:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "What's it saying?"

23:18:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "A moment, lem ping it again."

23:20:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

23:20:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Or something similar."

23:22:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "What nonsense."

23:22:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That station has been up for quite some time, in a failed attempt to stop the alliance from leaving the Accord of free worlds. The only reason the station is still transmitting is because its batteries haven't run dry."

23:23:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "What is it even talking about? Forgive my ignorance. I've not been, what do the teens call it? Up with the grind? Or some such."

23:23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The Accord! Everyone knows about the Accord."

23:23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Yes. I know about the accord. What I meant was, what is it going on about speicifically."

23:24:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, well, I'm surprised you haven't heard about that, either."

23:24:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "President Best is doing all he can to remove the AEu from the Accord."

23:24:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Uh, why?"

23:24:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Who can know."

23:27:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, the AEU pours about 500 million credits a week, plus personelle into the Accord, but those are all necessary things if we want to defend against the IFS and the Outsiders. However, President Best seems to -wrongly- think that the Outsiders and the IFS are no longer a threat. He'll change his tune soon enough when they inevitably launch invasions that will lose billions of credits in ships and who all can know what else. It's a matter of time before he and his administration tries to salvage what will ultimately be a pretty royal fuckup."

23:28:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Quite! What's he smoking, and can I have some?"

23:28:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't think you'd want some if it's making him act -that- stupid."

23:33:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "At least he's not so anal as to have tried to directly take out that station.."

23:34:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "My father thinks the outsiders aren't in chaos, you know. He thinks its a front."

23:35:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, they're very real. I fought them."

23:36:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Mhm, but you know how some people think killing that overlord through them into chaos? He doesn't agree."

23:36:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "He's not dead."

23:37:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "He's imprisoned."

23:37:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Is he being milked for information?"

23:37:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We don't really know what the EAOS is doing with him. Maybe they're using his lifeforce to power the Torus for all I know."

23:38:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Oh for the love of. Either milk him, and keep him alive, or kill him. Honestly!"

23:38:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Where ever he is, I hope it hurts."

23:39:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "I think those three options apply to most living things."

23:39:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "3?"

23:39:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "Milk, let live, kill."

23:40:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Hey, don't forget screw, too. That's important..."

23:40:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "Doesn't that count as milking?"

23:40:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Depends how its done, I suppose.."

23:41:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "When it's done right, I suppose it would."

23:41:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "True."

23:42:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Montgomery de la Corona transmits, "I don't know what I'm implying there but usually if you imply something gross or messy about sex people agree."
