Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

consisted of Old Earth's first few colony worlds. When Old Earth was silenced by
a worldwide depression, these worlds formed the AEU. Upon regaining contact, Old
Earth attempted to dissolve the AEU, resulting in the first War for
Independence, subsequently won by the AEU. It now strives to become the most

and stores. One that is blatantly apparent is the local Ship Shop, which retails
spacecraft. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets
is that one is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,
nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the west you see an exit much like
the main entrance, but smaller. You can make out a large arch through the doors.
A sign pointing east indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in
that direction.
You see a large sign and a police drone here.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal
clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad
itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water.
Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To
the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the
Spaceport.

one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 45", the one-person cargo
hauler "Debris Monster", the one-person cargo hauler "Sexy", the eight-person

[New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]
w
This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing
Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against
the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported
species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can
see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears
to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.

[New Earth; Spaceport East]
The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side
shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one
gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,
nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people
crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing
west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and
northwest.
[New Earth; Spaceport Central]
The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which
is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different
than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much
of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling
seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this
room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on
the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the
local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.
You see an automatic teller machine and a sanitation drone here.
Tracy Parker is asleep.

spacecraft. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets
is that one is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,
nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the west you see an exit much like

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal
clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad
itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water.
Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To
the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the
Spaceport.

[New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]
w
This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing
Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against
the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported
species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can
see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears
to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.
You can go east, south, and west.
[New Earth; Spaceport East]
The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side
shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one
gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,
nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people
crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing
west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.

You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and

[New Earth; Spaceport Central]
The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which
is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different
than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much
of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling
seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this
room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on
the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the
local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.
You see an automatic teller machine and a sanitation drone here.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal
clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad
itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water.
Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To
the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the
Spaceport.

[New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]
This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing
Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against
the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported
species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can
see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears
to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.

[New Earth; Spaceport East]
The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side
shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one
gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,
nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people
crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing
west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can here.

[New Earth; Supply Store]
Racks and shelves line the walls of this shop. All the wares a healthy ship

teenager is slumped behind the counter, resting his face on the sales counter as
he awaits the intrusion of a customer.
You see a message drone here.
You can go south.

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an
asteroid containing rock-eating microbes.

The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal
clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad
itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water.
Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To
the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the
Spaceport.

[New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]
This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing
Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against
the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported
species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can
see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears
to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.

[New Earth; Spaceport East]
The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side
shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one
gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,
nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people
crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing
west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.

of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling
seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this
room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on
the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the
local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.

[New Earth; Trading Center]
The trading center seems to be one of the busiest places in the spaceport. Which
is not surprising, considering the profits that successful trading can bring in.
Avoiding the automated computer terminals used by the career traders, you decide
to approach a human trade clerk. This, incidentally, will also subject your
purchases and sales to less scrutiny.
You can go southwest.

monopoles and exotic synthetic materials and wonder idly about the species that
may have created them.

[New Earth; HyperTea]
Welcome to HyperTea, another exciting moment in the history of tea. All HyperTea
locations are hyperspatially linked, allowing you to interact with people and
objects regardless of what HyperTea they're in.
From other locations, you see a song entitled "An Ode To Hotpants", a useless
fact generator, a "Ways To Annoy Your Roomate" contraption, a small tray, a
chromium jukebox, a page of Lucky trivia, an ocean full of tea, a comfortable
lounge chair, a floatable type raft in this sea of tea, a floating elk, a little
white magnet that says 'they', a pit of mud, and a box of squirrels here.

The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which
is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different
than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much
of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling
seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this

The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side
shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one
gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal
clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad
itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water.
Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To
the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the

Lileah Rose
She seems to be a member of the AEU.
She appears to be in her mid-twenties.  She is about five feet and four inches
tall, has a thin build, and fair skin.  Her eyes are blue-green, and her
platinum blonde hair that goes to the middle of her back is straight.
She is uninjured.
For a top, she is wearing a Thunder Cats t-shirt over a lace bra.  For a bottom,
she is wearing a pair of flared faded denim jeans over a pair of skimpy pink
lace bikini cut panties.  She is also wearing a diamond choker, a chrome-banded
wrist watch with the emerald green emblem of the AEU on the face, a small cloth
sack, a Jinu translator, a handbag, a standard starship flightbag, a leather
rifle sling, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, a metafrequency FTL
transmitter, a personal filing computer, a handwoven shoulder bag, a glittery
camera with a flower strap, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a
shimmering crystal bracelet, and a diamond tennis bracelet.
She is carrying a teleoperator card in her right hand.

spacecraft. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets
is that one is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,

The quiet residential/shopping Canada Street is intersected here by the much
larger Soviet Trail, which ends. Pedestrian traffic is light, as most of your
surroundings are quiet residential buildings and homes. North, down Soviet
Trail, you can see busier areas, but you enjoy the momentary calm. Lush green
trees line the street, forming a tunnel of sorts over it. The shade gives
respite to all kinds of local birds and wildlife, which congregate in them.

of Canada Street to the industry of the area to the north. The road broadens to

Help on: Matching

When referring to objects, while putting stuff away, removing stuff, etc., you
will probably encounter times where you're not getting the right object, because
more than one matches what you're typing.
To get around this, you may refer to objects as the following:

other thing
third thing
fourth thing

etc.

[New Phoenix; Ocean Arch]
A massive coral arch opens the city to travelers and citizens alike. Through it,
to the north, gently swaying palms, light blue, cloudless skies, and bustling
streets can be seen. Benches surround the fountain at the center of the towering
arch. A broad path leads through a tree overhang, heading to the city park. The
large entrance to New Phoenix's Spaceport lies just south.

The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which
is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different

of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling
seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this
room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on
the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the
local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.

nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people
crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing

Teleoperated Mining
Teleoperated mining consists of controlling a mining drone from a remote
location, using it to drill into asteroids to find precious materials.  It
provides a way to make money without having to use a ship.  The startup prices
are rather expensive, however.
Starting Out:
First, locate a teleoperated mining center.  There is one present on each
capital.  The first room you enter is the store.  Before you may do anything,
you must REGISTER and receive a card.  (You may later UNREGISTER, though it is
not necessary and you will lose everything.)  Then check out the MENU.  You will
need to purchase the following:
	-a mining drone
	-a sensor system
	-some drill bits
Mining Drone:
While very expensive, you will only ever need to buy one drone.
Sensors:
As expected, the more expensive sensor systems are better.  Better sensor
systems enable drone to find mining sites more easily.  This means it can find
closer sites, reducing drone travel time.
Drill Bits:
The more expensive drill bits are stronger.  The stronger a drill bit, the more
material it is able to locate at a mining site.  This means less travelling to
new sites.
Controlling the Drone:
Go into the next room, which is the control room.  Card in hand, type START. 
You will be presented with a menu.  From this point on, you can type MENU to see
your current options.  Activate the drone, and then load it with bits.  It can
only hold four at a time.  Send it to a new location, and then begin drilling. 
If a bit breaks, fit it with a new one.  If your drone can't find any more
material at a location, move to another.  And finally, if your storage fills up,
return to base and transfer.  When this is done, you may go back to the first
room and type PAYMENT for your money.
Lileah Rose laughs.
Lileah Rose asks, "well did you get a drone and drill bits and the best sensor
you can get?"
Lileah Rose says, "I wouldn't buy the most expensive bits to start"

Teleoperated Mining
Teleoperated mining consists of controlling a mining drone from a remote
location, using it to drill into asteroids to find precious materials.  It
provides a way to make money without having to use a ship.  The startup prices
are rather expensive, however.
Starting Out:
First, locate a teleoperated mining center.  There is one present on each
capital.  The first room you enter is the store.  Before you may do anything,
you must REGISTER and receive a card.  (You may later UNREGISTER, though it is
not necessary and you will lose everything.)  Then check out the MENU.  You will
need to purchase the following:
	-a mining drone
	-a sensor system
	-some drill bits
Mining Drone:
While very expensive, you will only ever need to buy one drone.
Sensors:
As expected, the more expensive sensor systems are better.  Better sensor
systems enable drone to find mining sites more easily.  This means it can find
closer sites, reducing drone travel time.
Drill Bits:
The more expensive drill bits are stronger.  The stronger a drill bit, the more
material it is able to locate at a mining site.  This means less travelling to
new sites.
Controlling the Drone:
Go into the next room, which is the control room.  Card in hand, type START. 
You will be presented with a menu.  From this point on, you can type MENU to see
your current options.  Activate the drone, and then load it with bits.  It can
only hold four at a time.  Send it to a new location, and then begin drilling. 
If a bit breaks, fit it with a new one.  If your drone can't find any more
material at a location, move to another.  And finally, if your storage fills up,
return to base and transfer.  When this is done, you may go back to the first
room and type PAYMENT for your money.

[New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]
This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing
Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against
the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported
species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can
see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears
to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.

[New Earth; Spaceport East]
The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side
shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one
gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,
nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people
crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing
west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.

[New Earth; Spaceport Central]
The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which
is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different
than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much
of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling
seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this
room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on
the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the
local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.
You see an automatic teller machine, a sanitation drone, and a police drone
here.

The western wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of shops

spacecraft. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets
is that one is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel,
nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the west you see an exit much like
the main entrance, but smaller. You can make out a large arch through the doors.

Metafrequency FTL Transmitters
An FTL transmitter allows a group of any number of players to maintain personal
radio contact with one another, regardless of alliance, via a previously decided
upon frequency.
To use a metafrequency FTL transmitter:
TURN TRANSMITTER ON/TURN TRANSMITTER OFF turns the power on and off,
accordingly.
TUNE TRANSMITTER TO <frequency> will tune the transmitter to the desired
frequency.  The range of valid transmitter frequencies is currently 1.01 to
599.99.
USE TRANSMITTER WITH <message> transmits your message to every transmitter tuned
to the same frequency as you.
CHECK TRANSMITTER tells you what frequency your transmitter is tuned to.
Finally, metafrequency transmitters also offer an earpiece option, for discreet
listening.  To utilize an earpiece, simply ATTACH it to the transmitter.  While
the transmitter is on your person and supports an earpiece, all messages from
the transmitter will be relayed to you only.  When you are done using an
earpiece, DETACH it from the metafrequency FTL transmitter.

Help on: Asteroid-hauling
-------------------------
The Art of Asteroid Hauling
---------------------------
Out in uncharted space are extremely large asteroids, big enough to land a ship
on.  These asteroids possess resources and valuable rare materials far beyond
any simple piece of debris.
The Intersector Space Resources Commission has decided that it wants these
valuable objects.  Using a new unique starship design and newly-designed
equipment, asteroids can now be hauled into Known Space and harvested for their
resources.
Introducing the asteroid hauler.  This two-person craft is designed specifically
to go out and locate new asteroids, land on them, attach lines and anchors, and
haul them back to a space station equipped to make use of them.
Although this operation proceeds much faster with two people aboard, one
determined pilot can also reap the benefits.  Bringing in an asteroid will net
the occupants of the ship anywhere from 2 to 7 million credits, and the crew
will each also receive two starship license points for their trouble.
Be warned, though, that a second asteroid hauler could conceivably detach your
anchors and haul your asteroid away.  The credit for bringing it in goes to
whoever sends the asteroid along its final trajectory into the space station's
collection bay.
The following space stations are now accepting asteroids:
Experimental Research Structure (EAOS)
Capella Station (EAOS)
Sector 8 Outpost (League)
L5 Station (League)
Sector 17 Station Alpha (AEU)
Sector 21 Station Delta (AEU)
Meredith Station (Fringe)
Evia Station (Fringe)
Good luck to the pilots and station workers involved in this ambitious new
project.
---------------------------
How To
---------------------------
If you want to be a 'roid cowboy, you need two kinds of supplies: anchors and
lines.  Anchors bite into the surface of the asteroid, becoming nearly
unremovable.  Lines are tied to the anchors and help to attach the asteroid to
the ship.  Also, of course, only an asteroid hauler is designed to move
asteroids.
Anchors must be placed in a particular formation: north, south, east, and west
of your ship.
You will need two lines.  One is tied to the north and south anchors, and the
other is tied to the east and west anchors.
Once the four anchors and two lines are secure, you must reenter your ship and
use the ANCHOR function.  This deploys the ship's own anchors, adding a second
layer of security while the asteroid moves.
Next, use the HAUL function.  You will choose from a list of valid collector
stations.  Keep note of the nearest collector station as you hunt for asteroids
(in fact, you probably want to search using a collector station as a base). 
Your ship will use its engines to move the asteroid, and the wormhole drive will
be unavailable.  If your collector station is quite a distance away, it can take
some time to travel there.
If at any time you need to stop the movement of the asteroid, use the standard
STOP function.  After a moment, the asteroid will gradually cease its movements.
When your asteroid arrives near the collector station, workers on the station
will pull it the rest of the way into the collector bay.  At this time, your
ship will be automatically pulled into the station's docking bay.  Any supplies
recovered from the asteroid will be placed here as well.
Note that asteroid hauling is best performed with a crew of two.  The rewards
are given out with this in mind.  Thus, the reward system works this way:
One person: The standard fee is received.
Two people: The crew members each receive the standard fee.
More than two people:  The standard fee is doubled, then divided evenly among
all crew members.
Good luck as a 'roid cowboy!

help communicator
----------------------
Help on: Communicators
----------------------
Two-Way FTL Communicators
Two-way FTL communicators allow two players to communicate from anywhere.  They
are sold in pairs.
To use them:
USE <communicator name> WITH <message>.
Metachannel FTL Communicators
Metachannel FTL communicators allow any number of players to communicate
simultaneously.  There are two options available:  general communication, which
includes every player, and communication among your alliance.
NO CHANNEL ANYWHERE IS DESIGNED TO BE AN OUT OF CHARACTER CHANNEL. REMAIN IN
CHARACTER ON ALL COMM CHANNELS AT ALL TIMES.
To use a metachannel FTL communicator:
TURN <communicator name> turns your communicator off and on.
   General:
    GENERAL <communicator name> turns general communication for you off and on.
 TRANSMIT GENERAL <message> will send your message over general communication.
   Alliance:
       Your alliance communication is on whenever your comm is.
    There are two alliance channel modes:  single and tuner.
    TUNE <communicator name> TO <channel number>.  Valid channels are 1 to 10,
and 0 for tuner.
             Single-channel:
             TRANSMIT  <message> will transmit on the channel your communicator
is tuned to.
           Tuner:
              TRANSMIT <channel number> <message> will transmit on the channel
you specify.
Metafrequency FTL Transmitters
An FTL transmitter allows a group of any number of players to maintain personal
radio contact with one another, regardless of alliance, via a previously decided
upon frequency.
To use a metafrequency FTL transmitter:
TURN TRANSMITTER ON/TURN TRANSMITTER OFF turns the power on and off,
accordingly.
TUNE TRANSMITTER TO <frequency> will tune the transmitter to the desired
frequency.  The range of valid transmitter frequencies is currently 1.01 to
599.99.
USE TRANSMITTER WITH <message> transmits your message to every transmitter tuned
to the same frequency as you.
CHECK TRANSMITTER tells you what frequency your transmitter is tuned to.
Finally, metafrequency transmitters also offer an earpiece option, for discreet
listening.  To utilize an earpiece, simply ATTACH it to the transmitter.  While
the transmitter is on your person and supports an earpiece, all messages from
the transmitter will be relayed to you only.  When you are done using an
earpiece, DETACH it from the metafrequency FTL transmitter.
