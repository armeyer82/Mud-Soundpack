00:00 [MTTS] usfolks: I asked my dog to walk me off a wall once. He did it. I didn't get mad. Other than at me. I told him to do it. He didn't get mad at me either.

00:01 [MTTS] Squidmind: Keep in mind that if you want your character to do something that will result in loss of licence or other form of unplayability, you can do it.  It's just... it will result in unplayability.  We don't try to stop people having their characters doing things that make sense for that character to do, we just want it to make sense and for the player to understand that unplayability means unplayability for that character.

00:01 [MTTS] Carroll: Sorry, what do you mean by unplayability by the character?

00:01 [MTTS] Squidmind: Although you should also keep in mind that the game world will respond to things people do, and if you want things to really respond, we need to know what the character is going to do before they do it. 

00:02 [MTTS] Squidmind: Where the character reaches a point where they are no longer able to continue acting as a civilian pilot, usually with revocation of their licence, or going unreg, or something else.  The point where the player no longer controls that particular character.

00:03 [MTTS] rosey: So are you saying it would not be possible to play just for roleplaying?

00:03 [MTTS] Squidmind: What do you mean by 'roleplaying'?  Everything I've just been talking about is about roleplaying.

00:04 [MTTS] nadira: I think she means, roleplaying someone who is not a civilian pilot.

00:04 [MTTS] rosey: Another thing, I love this game, want to play it badly enough that I have considered going as far as asking for help with a profile in a way that might sound theatening but that is how badly I want to be able to play to the full extent.

00:05 [MTTS] Squidmind: We tried offering the ability for players to have a non-pilot character at one point.  It took a lot of work for each one, and the players involved didn't have much fun with it.  The game is very much focused on being a civilian pilot.

00:05 [MTTS] usfolks: For my part, I'm very glad for one of those ooc asides. I looked into doing something with my char once, that if I had gone through with it, my char's license would have been immediately revoked, no questions asked, do not pass go, do not collect 200 credits. However, I as the player did not realize this. I knew there might be consequences, but not an actual immediate end. If staff hadn't put it to me bluntly, that this would mean a certain and immediate end, I wouldn't have known. There was no room for in-character warning.

00:05 [MTTS] rosey: Threatening.

00:06 [MTTS] rosey: By saying if I can get the help I need I would donate, do what I can to encourage others to play and in other words support the game in all I can, but if not I would do the opposite and try to make so others do not want to play.

00:06 [MTTS] rosey: That is how badly I want to play.

00:07 [MTTS] Squidmind: Threatening to try and stop people from playing the game is not going to help with your profile.  That sort of thing is very close to violating policy.

00:07 [MTTS] rosey: I do not mean it in a threatening way just trying to say how badly I want help and be able toplay.

00:07 [MTTS] Squidmind: We're willing to help with any specific questions you have, but we cannot and will not write a profile for you.

00:07 [MTTS] Squidmind: You're making a threat and saying you don't mean it in a threatening way?

00:08 [MTTS] usfolks: Rosey, best I can tell you is sit down and look critically at what they send you as a response to what you've submitted. Take the time. When I got my first rejection I read quickly through it and didn't really understand it. So sit down, take time, and read and re-read what they tell you. Then do as they say. Don't take some negative piece of it and overreact and throw everything in the garbage.

00:08 [MTTS] nadira: Yeah, what you are saying makes no sense. Even if the profile turned you from wanting to play here, why would you want to discourage others from playing here?

00:08 [MTTS] valiant8086: I made it through the process, if I can do it anybody can do it, and I didn't have any help beyond check this or that help file from people on newbie and the comments I got back on my concept and my profile submissions.

00:09 [MTTS] usfolks: Hey, I've seen the criticism about this game elsewhere. It won't be new. If you want to threaten that, I guarantee you it might just have the opposite effect.

00:09 [MTTS] usfolks: Same, Valiant8086.

00:09 [MTTS] rosey: I see what you are saying but I do so badly want to write a profile that can be approved but to be honest I want to wriet a profile that gets approved but am not good with words.

00:09 [MTTS] usfolks: Take your time.

00:09 [MTTS] rosey: Excuse that but I got distracted while typing.

00:10 [MTTS] Carroll: And I can write a good novel but not one that can fit into a mold that they want.

00:10 [MTTS] davetaylor: Agreed, I found a couple of issues, but they were talked about and I had a profile done. What the hosts were telling me at the time was spot on, and the chat we had made changes happen that should help everybody.

00:10 [MTTS] Squidmind: You don't need to be a fantastic author or anything, we just want to be able to understand the character of the person you plan to play.

00:10 [MTTS] Squidmind: That's the whole point of the profile.

00:10 [MTTS] nadira: Oh yeah, I have sat on another game where, on the ooc channel players were bashing games, including Star Conquest. And someone once asked me why I still play, and I told them, because I like the game. Simple.

00:10 [MTTS] valiant8086: Then write one and listen to what they say, when they make comments and don't accept it, maybe you could even ask on newbie or something here if anybody can explain what the comments you got mean?

00:10 [MTTS] usfolks: It's not a mold they're looking for, Carroll. They're just asking you avoid a few things that are overused to an extreme.

00:11 [MTTS] rosey: To the extent that I wonder what is left to be allowed.

00:11 [MTTS] Squidmind: The 'mold' we want is 'civilian pilot in the world of Star Conquest'.  If you want to play a Star Trek captain, or a Jedi, or a half-human hybrid, this isn't the game for you.

00:11 [MTTS] usfolks: Tons of stuff.

00:11 [MTTS] valiant8086: The issue where I couldn't play as a cadet at all was pretty much limited to me right?

00:11 [MTTS] rosey: That is where I need help.

00:11 [MTTS] usfolks: Look how many distinct characters with approved profiles there already are. You can't tell me we're all the same.

00:12 [MTTS] valiant8086: Because I'm suddenly wondering if somebody's pissed off cause they're stuck and can't get out and play at all because they don't have a character concept.

00:12 [MTTS] rosey: My first character had the first profile approved and now I can't do it.

00:12 [MTTS] usfolks: Can't never could.

00:13 [MTTS] Squidmind: valiant8086: Not solely to you, but it's only meant to be set up when someone is a troublemaker or sets off something suspicious.  Unfortunately, you got tagged because of your timing when you created.

00:13 [MTTS] usfolks: Rosey, I'm wondering if that might be the first and main problem. You THINK you CAN'T. But the truth is, you're afraid to try.

00:13 [MTTS] Carroll: And the hosts even loved two of my fave chars but due to ooc reasons I got rid of them and yes I was and still sad and yes I miss them very much.

00:13 [MTTS] rosey: I have tried and failed.

00:13 [MTTS] davetaylor: This is my first major RP, as I'm sure a lot of people can guess, and I got a profile done, and after tonight, I know what I'd do for a concept if I now had to, so anyone can.

00:14 [MTTS] usfolks: Just because you have failed in the past, doesn't mean you won't succeed in the future. Flip a switch. Adjust the attitude, and try again.

00:14 [MTTS] Squidmind: Failure is the first step to success!

00:14 [MTTS] usfolks: Exactly.

00:14 [MTTS] Squidmind: And the second.  Often also the hundredth.

00:14 [MTTS] Carroll: If I oculd I would have one of my fave cars back, but alas!

00:15 [MTTS] valiant8086: Heh, well I'm glad I kept trying to get out and complaining about it. I'd sure have been missing out if I'd just quit and gave it up.

00:15 [MTTS] Butchulla: And remember, support tickets exist for a reason. The glorious squidmind has already said here today that the hosts are more than willing to assist you with your profile.

00:15 [MTTS] usfolks: Rosey, there's something I'm working on that's getting tons and tons of rejection. But guess what? I keep trying. I know I can get it right. And there's the difference. KNow that there are those who want to help. Staff included. And a mentor. And maybe try something new. Maybe a new alliance or a new aspect...but change something up and maybe you'll be able to get where you want to be.

00:16 [MTTS] alc_71: Staff is very helpful if you give them a chance. They've given me many tips for RP and things over the years.

00:16 [MTTS] valiant8086: And keep what you already wrote in a word processor so you can keep working from that and not starting over from scratch.

00:16 [MTTS] usfolks: Absolutely.

00:17 [MTTS] Butchulla: Half my problem is that I appreciate that the hosts give up their spare time for us, so I hate bugging them with supports. I mean of course I do it, but there's the part of me that feels bad for taking up their time.

00:17 [MTTS] nadira: Yeah, I wrote the profile in a notepad and so I still have the profiles for my previous characters. And whenever I am in doubt as how to play my current character, I do read the approved profile.

00:18 [MTTS] usfolks: For those that play tabletop, and Rosey and Carroll, not sure if you two do, but imagine sitting down to a tabletop game with no character profile set out. How do you make decisions for your character? How do you roleplay? You don't. That concept and profile is a necessity for roleplay, and I'm so glad that it's such a focus here.

00:18 [MTTS] davetaylor: Same Butchulla, I try to figure things out on my own, but I know when I have something big, I will need to support.

00:18 [MTTS] Carroll: I have seen people play tabletop and they play as they go.

00:18 [MTTS] usfolks: I have never heard of a tabletop game where you don't at least make a character sheet to start out with.

00:19 [MTTS] valiant8086: Me neither.

00:19 [MTTS] usfolks: You have to know what your char's strengths and weaknesses are, their race, their skills, etc.

00:19 [MTTS] Carroll: But isnt' that sheet just the stats?

00:19 [MTTS] rosey: In real life too, our whole life is not planned out, we live life according to waht comes up or what happens.

00:19 [MTTS] nadira: I have never played a table top. But I can not imagine ever playing one without at least some idea of who I am playing.

00:19 [MTTS] Butchulla: In tabletop without a char sheet you may as well forget it. I completely see the point usfolks is making here.

00:19 [MTTS] usfolks: The profile is like your stats. Think of it that way. Without it, how do you even play?

00:19 [MTTS] Squidmind: There are two ways to create a character - the first is you start with the concept and play it, the second is you start playing and then craft the concept in that early period.  Both are valid here, because you can enter the game as a cadet, whose IC existence is in a state of flux until the profile is approved.

00:20 [MTTS] usfolks: This is not real life, Rosey. This is roleplay.

00:20 [MTTS] Carroll: I play in games as I go, like for instance a char could be sitting in the lounge or on a ship wit ithers either on a trip or fighting, then when life happens I act according.

00:21 [MTTS] Squidmind: Rosey: In real life, your character is created as you grow up to reach the 'now'.  In-game, you're starting at the 'now', and we have to work backwards to find out about that character.

00:21 [MTTS] Carroll: To me roleplay is imagine as I go.

00:21 [MTTS] davetaylor: Those stats in the table top games help you decide what actions to take, are you going to hit something, cast a spell on it, run away, what are you going to do?

00:21 [MTTS] usfolks: That's something else entirely, Carroll.

00:21 [MTTS] Butchulla: Now I kinda wish we had to make will and fort saves and whatnot, to figure out what our character would be.

00:21 [MTTS] Squidmind: 'Imagine as I go' sounds like you just decide semi-randomly how to act in any given moment.  That isn't a consistent character, or at least not a character that would ever have been approved a licence.  Hence the issue there.

00:22 [MTTS] alc_71: Yes, there is playing as you go. But too, you need some background. Like, I am a good fighter because, why? Or I am a terrible fighter because I, why?

00:22 [MTTS] Carroll: Hey its better than me living at home doing nothing, think of my char in a future space world and boom, for me that is rp.

00:22 [MTTS] usfolks: It was very helpful for me to play the game for awhile before starting to write a profile. We didn't have concepts back then. (you lucky whippersnappers). But getting a feel for the game world helps you develop a history. How you got here. Why you're here, how you're going to react now that you are.

00:22 [MTTS] nadira: Yeah, what squidmind says, the choices you would make today are defined by upbringing, personality, all sorts.

00:23 [MTTS] davetaylor: And a whole 250 points of all types before you get capped, you lucky things.

00:23 [MTTS] usfolks: Carroll, that is not RP.

00:23 [MTTS] Carroll: For me a concept is hard as I can't put my personality and so on in one sentence.

00:23 [MTTS] usfolks: That is you being you in a different setting.

00:23 [MTTS] Squidmind: And that's a perfectly valid form of roleplay in some places.  Just not here.  Different places will expect different things from roleplay.  If you want a consistent game world, you need consistent characters to inhabit that world.

00:23 [MTTS] valiant8086: Your personality is not wanted in the concept, not really as far as I understand.

00:23 [MTTS] Butchulla: Yeah. That's amazing that points thing. We had 25 in each category. So you guys are lucky. You have way more time to feel out the game.

00:24 [MTTS] Squidmind: The concept is a single summation of the character.  If you had to describe someone in a single sentence, how would you do it?  How would you describe Elon Musk?  Adolf Hitler?  Superman?  David Bowie?

00:25 [MTTS] Squidmind: Adolf Hitler loved dogs, played with kids, was an artist.  But does that tell us anything about his personality?  No.

00:25 [MTTS] usfolks: Here's the thing. You can use this as an escape, sure. But Rosey is playing Rosey in the future, that is not roleplaying. If Carroll is playing Carroll in the future, that is not roleplaying. That is being you in a different setting. In order to be able to decide how your char will react on a consistent basis, you have to have something set out that will determine that. My char does things that drive me up the wall. Because my char has a background very different to mine. But if I just went with my imagination and played how I would...I wouldn't be roleplaying at all.

00:25 [MTTS] Carroll: David would be a good musician adolph woudl be a bad man to whilled just because he thought the race of people who was inferior.

00:26 [MTTS] usfolks: That doesn't tell you who they are.

00:26 [MTTS] Squidmind: Neither of those define either of those people.

00:26 [MTTS] Carroll: Hmm, I am stuck now.

00:26 [MTTS] Squidmind: 'musician' and 'bad man' can apply to millions of people.

00:27 [MTTS] davetaylor: Key things about these people are things like how they go about getting what they want done, and what effect that has on people.

00:27 [MTTS] Carroll: Adolph was a ruthless tyrant who killed because he thougth a race was inferior. Ok maybe I am missing something, so hwo would I define David or Adolph then?

00:28 [MTTS] valiant8086: Maybe I'm missing somebody's point but that actually sounded a little close to to what is wanted in the concept.

00:29 [MTTS] Carroll: Hmm, maybe I am nto good a short blurbs but a person who is either outgoing or greedy is easier to describe.

00:29 [MTTS] valiant8086: You saw the help files about this right?

00:30 [MTTS] Carroll: So would a concept e a person who likes to explore, is outgoing but can be quiet when the situation is uncomfortable or warranted.

00:30 [MTTS] Carroll: Yes I saw the profile but I can't seemt o fit mine in.

00:30 [MTTS] Squidmind: One example for Hitler might be 'A charismatic bigot who wants to restore his nation's glory by vilifying those different to him.'  You have aspects of 'bad man' there, but there's enough to separate him from everyone else who does bad things.  You see a tiny aspect of the drive he has.  For Bowie, maybe 'A confused man who spent his life trying to find himself through the art he created.'

00:31 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yeah, Carroll's second example was a lot closer.

00:32 [MTTS] Squidmind: Basically, what defines the character as a person?  What is the core of them?

00:35 [MTTS] Squidmind: We're not asking for a fully fleshed out three dimensional entire life of a person, that would be ridiculous. But we want something that makes it appear as if that life could exist.

00:35 [MTTS] rosey: In real life I am limited in what I can do and am allowed to do from others and from consequences and so some of that stuff I would like to do in the game, I like to play with the pupppets and music instruments here.

00:36 [MTTS] usfolks: When that character concept came out, I sat down and wrote one for my char. And then I went, ok, how would I have changed his profile based on this? I think I would have been able to write that profile a lot better the first time if I'd had that concept of who I (always) wanted him to be if I'd started with the concept first. And like Dave, I've gone back and looked at my profile. And that profile has allowed me to have some amazing RP opportunities, thanks to hosts. They helped me with events (based off the profile) that have made the char so much more real.

00:36 [MTTS] Squidmind: I am sorry to hear that there are things you are limited in doing and disallowed from doing in real life, rosey.  However, this game is not really focused on playing musical instruments and playing with puppets, nor are either of those a character concept.

00:37 [MTTS] rosey: In feedback on my profiles I have also been told that flying ships and doint pilot stuff is not all there is either so how do I kow how I can put in a profile.

00:38 [MTTS] rosey: Know.

00:38 [MTTS] valiant8086: Play as a cadet for a while and find out?

00:38 [MTTS] usfolks: It's a combination. Life isn't just your job. Your personality isn't your job.

00:38 [MTTS] davetaylor: Stuff about what you're like in groups, how you deal with conflict, are you ambitious, laid back, argumentative, do you keep quiet or speak without thinking, so many things you can talk about.

00:38 [MTTS] rosey: I have done that and kknow the game quite well.

00:38 [MTTS] Squidmind: Flying ships and 'doing pilot stuff' is basically the job of the character.  It doesn't add anything to the profile because you're describing game mechanics, not a personality.  If you mean that you say in the profile that your character wants to fly ships and 'do pilot stuff', that also doesn't add to the -character-, because the character is the why, not the what.

00:39 [MTTS] valiant8086: Yeah butt all are we talking about the concept or the profile here.

00:40 Wait 11 seconds.

00:40 [MTTS] Squidmind: And as valiant8086 has just reminded me, we're talking about concepts here.  The concept shouldn't be talking about flying ships or 'doing pilot stuff' at all, unless for some reason the character is entirely obsessed with that to the exclusion of all else, and that would be a very, very hard sell to the point where I'd basically suggest not doing that.

00:40 [MTTS] Carroll: I had a concept and profile but need to start afresh.

00:40 Wait 4 seconds.

00:40 Wait 3 seconds.

00:40 Wait 2 seconds.

00:40 Wait 1 second.

00:40 You pick up a disk of metal with an ornate design.
You put a disk of metal with an ornate design into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

00:40 Wait 17 seconds.

00:40 [MTTS] usfolks: Have you been told to start afresh, or is this a limitation you're putting on yourself?

00:40 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]

00:40 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

00:40 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

00:40 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

00:40 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

00:41 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

00:41 [MTTS] valiant8086: Hmm. I didn't do the profile until I had an approved concept. Maybe don't bother with the profile yet? Maybe that's bad advice.

00:41 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

00:41 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

00:41 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

00:41 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

00:41 [MTTS] Carroll: I feel pressure from both sides.

00:41 [MTTS] usfolks: What Valiant just said is (I believe) the whole reason for having the concept in the first place.

00:41 I don't understand that.

00:41 [MTTS] Squidmind: If you can't do a concept it's very likely whatever profile you write will have major problems, that's why the concept comes first.

00:42 [MTTS] usfolks: Why delve into senior high if you've never been to Middle School?

00:42 [MTTS] Squidmind: The profile is the expanded version of that concept.

00:42 [MTTS] Carroll: Bingo Squid, that is why I am trying to think of a good concept that would flow into a good profile.

00:43 [MTTS] usfolks: Build your foundation first. The house comes after.

00:44 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

00:45 [MTTS] rosey: How about this as a concept? Dorothy is a girl who is tired of the mundane life she is used to and whishes to spread her wings?

00:46 [MTTS] Squidmind: It's better than talking about starships or playing the piano, but it still suffers from the same basic issue. It doesn't describe who Dorothy is or separate her from all the other people who are tired of their mundane lives and want to spread their wings.  What makes her any different to them?

00:47 [MTTS] rosey: Hmm let me use my imagination.

00:47 [MTTS] Squidmind: But you're definitely on the right track.

00:47 [MTTS] rosey: Thanks.

00:48 [MTTS] Carroll: Carroll is a confused girl trying to find herself and in time learns to somehow free herself and find knowledge, adventure and personal growth.

00:49 [MTTS] Carroll: Since there are so many tropes what am I allowed to do?

00:49 [MTTS] Squidmind: That one isn't so good.  You've copied the first half of the Bowie concept but haven't actually got the meaningful part, you just have a bit where you talk about a vague future.

00:50 [MTTS] Squidmind: You still haven't explained what you mean by tropes and 'allowed to do'.

00:51 [MTTS] Carroll: I mean the many tropes that are mentioned in the help file, I mean I cannot be an explorer, or comr from a poor background or from a farming background, etc etc.

00:51 [MTTS] usfolks: Carroll, tropes are just that because they're overused and overused. Everyone wants to have a tragic past where they were left alone at a young age on a farm because the Outsiders killed their parents (who happened to be famous). If you can find a way to make a trope not tropish...then try it. Tropes are not an absolute no. You just have to find a way to make them not so common.

00:51 [MTTS] Squidmind: None of those things should define a person.  They are forbidden tropes because people tried to use them as a replacement for actually putting in a character.

00:52 [MTTS] Carroll: Sinc ehtere are so many, hwo would I flesh even the vauge concepts I had just put out nhere?

00:52 [MTTS] Carroll: Er mistyping.

00:52 [MTTS] Carroll: I meant since there are so many, hwo can I flesh out the vague concepts and even make a good profile.

00:53 [MTTS] Squidmind: There are nineteen examples in the forbidden tropes help file.  Do you really think there are only nineteen possible character archetypes or personalities in the world?  Most of those forbidden tropes don't actually have anything to do with the character at all, but events in-game or family history.

00:53 [MTTS] usfolks: As an example, there is a country bumpkin whose dead relative was a pilot and has a politician parent. However, while they are tropes, they were done in a way that didn't follow exactly as others had used them. So they made it through. Be creative. Don't use what everyone else has.

00:54 [MTTS] usfolks: These things also do not define said character. They are but a tiny bit of the history.

00:54 [MTTS] usfolks: Ok, maybe the country bumpkin does...

00:54 [MTTS] Squidmind: If your profile is 'I lived on a farm, my parents were farmers and did farmer things, I did farmer things, then I became a pilot.'  How does that tell us anything about that character?  They know how to plough a field?  That's a skill, not part of their personality.

00:55 [MTTS] davetaylor: Why become a pilot given how people feel about pilots?

00:55 [MTTS] rosey: I thought you did not want personality in concept.

00:55 [MTTS] Squidmind: Rosey: Carroll specifically mentioned the profile, so I responded to that.

00:55 [MTTS] usfolks: The tropes shouldn't play a part in concept at all, even if you find a way to make them work.

00:55 [MTTS] rosey: Oh.

00:56 [MTTS] Squidmind: Basically, the why is always more important than the what.  The what can give context, but without the why is entirely useless.

00:57 [MTTS] rosey: Even in real life I would have problems explaining why I do what I do.

00:57 [MTTS] rosey: Sometimes.

00:57 [MTTS] usfolks: We all do sometimes. But can you explain why you are (in general) the way you are? Not individual actions, but your general persona?

00:57 [MTTS] rosey: Not really.

00:58 [MTTS] rosey: Maybe to a certain extent.

00:59 [MTTS] rosey: For example I have an anger problem in RL that I would say I got from my dad who had the same problem.

01:24 [MTTS] rosey: The concept examples in the concept help file sound like a story that has been completed and the char was no more.

01:25 [MTTS] valiant8086: It's not that they are no more, it's that they're touching on the subject of how the character got to this point, sort of.

01:27 [MTTS] rosey: Okay maybe I misunderstand but to me it sounds as if pilot life was not what they had hoped for.

01:27 [MTTS] usfolks: Sometimes that's the case.

01:27 [MTTS] rosey: To summarize.

01:27 [MTTS] usfolks: Not always do our dream jobs turn out to be what we hoped they would be.

01:27 [MTTS] rosey: But how would you know that in a concept.

01:27 [MTTS] usfolks: The concept is what you know. Not the other way around.

01:28 [MTTS] rosey: I am still trying to come up with something acceptable.

01:28 [MTTS] usfolks: You were told you were on the right track...so just work on that and submit something.

01:29 [MTTS] usfolks: Then see what they have to say about it and go from there.

01:29 [MTTS] rosey: I know that but to know how to work on it is what I am struggling with.

01:32 [MTTS] rosey: How about, Dorothy is tired of mundane life and wishes to spread her wings, so decides to join the civilian pilot core hoping it will let her do that.?

01:32 [MTTS] usfolks: That's pretty much every pilot ever. What makes her unique to do it in the way she did? How is she any different from the thousands of other pilots?

01:33 [MTTS] rosey: That is the part I am having trouble coming up with something for.

01:34 [MTTS] usfolks: Instead of giving it minutes, maybe give it some hours or a day to think about it?

02:28 [Outside Celestial Explorer]

02:28 You float above the starship's brightly-shining hull, which at this distance blocks off a large portion of your view of space.  The glint of stars reflects from the hull.  The reflection is occasionally distorted by various weapons scars or pockmarks.
You can go in any direction using a spacejet, or return to Celestial Explorer.
You are weightless here.

02:28 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]

02:28 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

02:29 You may not leave the airlock until its environment matches that of the ship.

02:29 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

02:30 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

02:30 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

02:30 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

02:30 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

02:30 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

02:30 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

02:30 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

02:30 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:35 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

02:35 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

13:53 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]

13:53 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else.

14:21 I don't understand that.

22:53 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

22:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Rapid Recharging Eatery & Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.

23:50 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
