00:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

00:24 Pleasure pulses through your body in time with the throbbing of the colors.

00:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

00:34 Your nerves tingle pleasantly with every pulse of the colors surrounding the ship.

00:45 Pleasure pulses through your body in time with the throbbing of the colors.

00:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:56 Pleasure pulses through your body in time with the throbbing of the colors.

00:56 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

00:56 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

00:57 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

00:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

01:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:16 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:17 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

01:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:28 It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.

01:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:36 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

01:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:46 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Later Keegan."

01:47 You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.

01:55 You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!

01:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

01:57 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.

01:57 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

02:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:15 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

02:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:27 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

02:58 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

03:01 The room grows a bit more chill.

03:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:13 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she whistles.

03:13 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo, Jim, I have a quick question if you are not busy or sleepy."

03:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:28 Something tickles the back of your neck.

03:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:38 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

03:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:47 The room grows a bit more chill.

03:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

03:58 You hear something fall in the next room.

03:59 Lily Kaise examines a robotic chef named Nellie for a moment.

03:59 Lily Kaise helps herself to a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake.

03:59 Lily Kaise dangles a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

04:00 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

04:07 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

04:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

04:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:30 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

04:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:40 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

04:50 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

04:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

04:57 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

05:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:02 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

05:02 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

05:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

05:22 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

05:33 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

05:43 Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.

05:44 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

05:55 The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and closing. It then abruptly swims off.

06:02 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

06:03 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

06:03 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

06:21 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

06:32 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

06:39 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

06:49 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

06:57 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

07:04 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

07:04 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

07:15 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

07:34 A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

07:35 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

07:45 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

07:56 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

08:04 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

08:04 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

08:05 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

08:20 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

08:22 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Byeee."

08:23 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Later."

08:34 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

08:38 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

08:49 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

08:59 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

09:00 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

09:05 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

09:05 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

09:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

09:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

09:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

09:28 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

09:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:38 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

09:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:49 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

09:51 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

09:53 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Coming."

09:53 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Augh, these buttons."

09:54 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

09:55 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

09:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:57 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

09:59 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

10:07 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

10:07 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

10:07 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

10:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

10:09 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

10:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

10:21 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Are you all waking up after the repairs."

10:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:37 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

10:58 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

11:08 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

11:08 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

11:09 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

12:07 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

12:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:09 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

12:10 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

12:10 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi!"

12:10 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi."

12:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

12:39 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

12:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

12:50 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

13:00 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

13:05 You put on a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

13:05 You blink heavily and then doze off.

13:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:10 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

14:27 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey Nissi?"

14:28 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hello."

14:28 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey. Wasn't sure if you knew we've been in chart range for awhile, so didn't know if you might wanna stop and get us a good heading to Farport."

14:28 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Maybe I DON'T!"

14:28 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

14:29 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

14:33 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo!"

15:35 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

15:35 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

15:35 The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

15:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:05 The group slowly struggles closer to the city.

16:10 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

16:12 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:12 Lily Kaise switches a metallic gold touch einrophone off.

16:15 One of the group falls down into the snow. Others struggle past, too exhausted to help.

16:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:25 A baby wails, its cries muffled by a thick swaddling of blankets.

16:36 One of the group falls down into the snow. Others struggle past, too exhausted to help.

16:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

16:36 The group arrives at the outskirts of the city. It is frozen and windswept, and no smoke rises from the chimneys. Some of the group cry out in dismay, dropping to their knees in despair as the snow flies more thickly, obscuring your vision.

16:36 Listen. You need to be careful.

16:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

17:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

17:01 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

17:06 Don't let them trick you.

17:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

17:17 Don't let them trick you.

17:27 They're just using you.

17:37 Terrible things. They want to do terrible things.

17:39 Remember what I said.

17:39 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

18:09 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

18:19 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

18:30 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

18:40 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

18:40 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

19:10 A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something hidden inside the endless webbing.

19:20 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

19:21 A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to a viewport.

19:31 There is a sudden squeak from somewhere inside the starship, cut off with a crunch and the sound of scuttling legs.

19:34 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:39 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Repairs?"

19:39 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Pierre is checking the chart."

19:42 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:42 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:42 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

19:53 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:53 You hear a loud clang, followed by a distinct thud: the sound of a ship docking.

19:55 You hear a low scraping sound as the ship undocks.

19:55 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Why'd we dock?"

19:55 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "They did."

19:55 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "While I was telling them I'll come over."

19:56 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nice."

19:56 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:56 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

19:57 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay people, we have a conclusions disc."

19:57 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Let's watch it, I guess."

19:57 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're in observation."

20:26 Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.

20:36 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

20:46 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

20:56 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

20:57 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

21:27 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

21:27 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

21:29 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

21:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

21:39 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

21:49 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

21:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

21:59 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

21:59 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

22:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:14 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

22:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
