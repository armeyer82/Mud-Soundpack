Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Living Quarters Three]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is at Famous Andy's Trading Post;
Docking Bay.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Magellan the arachnoid
security robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, a small red insulated cooler, a

[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I see!"
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Can I put more than one scoop on my ship
somehow?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Type scoop on a landing pad and you'll be
able to transfer other people's scoops onto your ship."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If I'm understanding your question
correctly."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Thanks, that's what I meant."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "So, when I go scooping, I can bring
somebody else with me and we can both launch our scoops? That question make
sense?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes. Use MOVESCOOP."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Put the two scoops on the same ship, and
when you use scoop aboard the ship, you will each be put into your respective
scoops."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Excellent!"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just be sure both of you can scoop at

[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You probably have a book with a page
that lists it."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Hmm, not on me, don't recall ever seeing
one in a bookstore either. Hmm."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's by my character, if that helps. A
book about industry."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh, yes I do have that."

[PA] Johann Schraft: "Testing."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Works!"
[PA] Johann Schraft: "If you're not here, sucks to be you."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "As an AEU alliance member, would
it be stupid to ask over general for help to get into mutuality space to do
someone a favor?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Shweet."
The hovertrailer carrying you fishtails briefly.
A sudden shift in gravity pulls you down as the hovertruck rises into the air to
travel over a perpendicular highway.
The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.
An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.
A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.
A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Are we allowed to refer to the who
list in character?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Same goes for the where command."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "And how do I refer to it IC."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Looking at your comm."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Gotcha."
Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new
updraft.
The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.
The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.
The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird
replaces it.
The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird
replaces it.
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Katie if you're still on, the who command
references your communicator, so my assumption would be that in character, our
communicators can show us who's connected and detected presently."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Yep. Thanks for that."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The comm description also references a
list of names."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you look at your communicat...uh...wh
at Erik said."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Incidentally, that's how titles would be
IC."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Exactly."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "That and, supposedly, the name of
speakers is displayed textually."
The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.
The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly fades.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around
them.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.
The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over
an overturned tree.
A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How did you do that sallery thing erik?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Spell it correctly and that's the
command."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The salary command."
The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.
[Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Is there a way to turn
off wen you are in a room and people speak into there com units?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "No."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "They're talking. Just like someone
talking on a phone, you can hear them."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If you can't see the channel they're
talking on, you'll see what they say into them."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I'm trying to play with this salary thing
now, when I type salary it says type alary <player> to add somebody to my salary
list, when I type salary erik, it says I don't see that here."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's a bit finicky."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sometimes you have to use full first and
last name."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "He has to be in the room. Also, try his
full name."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's pretty old code. I don't even know
if the hosts have updated it since new SC."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh got it."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is more than one character that
spells their name E-r-i-k."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And to think I spelled it like that to be
unique, even though it made little sense."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's uncommon but certainly not unique.
Maybe with a Q it would have been..."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How do I remove erik from my salary now?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's not the tipical merican spelling,
which is why I figured. Anyways."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Salary <person> again."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Both the ones I know that spell it that
way are 'mericans."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh, the only person I know who spells it
with a k is from...I actually don't remember where."
Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.
A small snail glides effortlessly across the inner surface of the glass.
The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I suppose you coulld expell your ammo box
and buy a new box and fill it properly, otherwise I don't know."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "That'd work."
The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.
A massive sphere looms ahead of the hovertruck, soon becoming evident as a
slow-rolling ball of tentacles. The truck moves around it smoothly.
An arc of light much like a meteor draws itself in the sky overhead.
The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.
An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.
Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.
The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.
The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How do I use this shaving kit?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Looking at it gives you the command."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Check the commands on it."
Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.
A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in.
As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and
purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.
A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous
blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as
a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.
A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric
blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.
The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.
The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship
is back in the riftflow.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
[Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "How do I lie someone down who is
standing or is there a way?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can only do it without their
permission if they're idle (standing in a stupor) or asleep, number one."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "2, the syntax is put <person> on
<object>."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can lie someone down?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I thought you meant just put them on the
floor."
[Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Yes I was wondering if there is a way to
make them lie on the floor if you do not have furniture."
[Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "And they are stadning."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If they're standing in a stupor, and it
looks weird to you, and you're so inclined, put them on an object. Otherwise,
no. Put furniture in the room."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or...just ignore it."
[Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Thanks."

[Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Control Room]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a large leather couch, a compact white
refrigerator, a black plastic trash can, an elegant crystal decanter, Raiatea
the arachnoid security robot, an insulated white cooler, and Manx the little

misisons, I don't know."

mangled stump where his right arm once was.

like I do sometimes they'll slap one of those on you."
[Newbie Help] Jake Smith transmits, "But now it doesn't show me up as a cadet
though? Cause the options said something about pilot cadet."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh, hit title, then put cadett."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Cadet."
Howling, infuriated people inexplicably roll massive weights at each other,
tortured bodies straining with the effort.
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Question, do I ever have an accent? I see
some people even have a neutral accent, but I've never once seen it mention that
I say something in some accent."

The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

you're waiting for it."

should *not* refer to profiles IC, but when you sign up to the civilian pilot

the full wack, or something similar. Its in help civilian core, I think."

[Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Living Quarters Three]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Magellan the arachnoid
security robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, a small red insulated cooler, and
a small purple trash bin here.
You can go out.

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this

distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a plain white spacesuit helmet, a light blue shipsuit with
cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs, a plain white spacesuit top, a
pair of plain white spacesuit gloves, a plain white spacesuit bottom, and a pair
of plain white spacesuit boots. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag
with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', a
