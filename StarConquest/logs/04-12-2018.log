02:38 Probably not a good idea to be wandering around here while wearing a few hundred extra pounds of armor and weapons.

02:38 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

02:38 [New Earth Spaceport; Low Priority Ground Deployment]
You see an EAOS Conjurer here.
You can go north.

You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

02:38 You can't go that way.

02:38 You can't go that way.

02:38 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

02:38 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Constantine Stone and Molly Grant are sitting on a slim and fashionable couch.
You can go out.

02:38 You wave.

02:38 Molly Grant

02:38 She appears to be 23 years old. She is about five feet and seven inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. She has broad shoulders and very small breasts. Her face is square, lightly-freckled, and unblemished, with a straight nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and light pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of cosmetically perfect teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes are grey and round. Her shoulder-length, straight hair is blonde and drawn back in a ponytail. She has oval light pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a faded black leather bomber jacket, a long-sleeved brown fatigue shirt, a pair of loose-fitting brown fatigue pants, and a pair of supple black flight boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a neon green metachannel FTL communicator, and a brownish bronze canvas gear bag. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

02:38 Constantine Stone waves.
A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.

02:38 Molly Grant waves.

02:38 Constantine Stone takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural tangerine juice.

02:38 Molly Grant exclaims, "It's that guy again!"

02:38 Constantine Stone asks, "Which guy?"

02:38 Constantine Stone glances around at his surroundings.

02:38 You exclaim, "YEah, run hide!"

02:38 Molly Grant points at you.

02:38 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Oh!"

02:38 You smirk at Constantine Stone.

02:39 You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.

02:40 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the four-person mule "Daisy May" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:40 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person Accord gemini "Hummingbird's Glory" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:40 Lily Kaise just arrived.

02:40 Constantine Stone waves.

02:40 You beam at Lily Kaise.

02:40 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:40 Lily Kaise waves to Molly Grant.

02:40 Lily Kaise waves to Constantine Stone.

02:40 Molly Grant waves to Lily Kaise.

02:40 Evenia Callseah just arrived.

02:41 Constantine Stone waves.

02:41 Constantine Stone stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

02:41 Constantine Stone hugs Evenia Callseah.

02:41 I don't see that here.

02:41 Evenia Callseah hugs Constantine Stone.

02:41 You wave to Evenia Callseah.

02:41 Molly Grant exclaims, "Evenia arrived!"

02:41 Evenia Callseah waves to you.

02:41 Evenia Callseah says, "I did. Sorry I had to go fetch this suit."

02:41 Lily Kaise waves.

02:41 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:41 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Shule?"

02:41 Constantine Stone says, "No worries."

02:41 You tickle Lily Kaise!

02:41 Constantine Stone says, "My suit was under a thick layer of dust."

02:41 Molly Grant says, "You should get a maid to keep it tidy."

02:41 Lily says to Molly, "Want to come along? We won't let you explode your suit this time."

02:41 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:42 Evenia Callseah says, "With 2 double energies, this thing gets over 400. Fucking love it."

02:42 Lily Kaise grins.

02:42 Constantine says to Molly, "A robot one!"

02:42 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:42 Molly says to Lily, "No thank you, perhaps next time."

02:42 Molly says to Constantine, "If you like robots in maid uniforms, I guess?"

02:42 Lily says to Molly, "Ok well this is a pretty easy one and you could just come along for the fun of it."

02:42 Constantine says to Molly, "I don't really picture it wearing a uniform."

02:42 Lily Kaise exclaims, "But we'll keep you in mind!"

02:42 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok everyone ready?"

02:42 Constantine says to Molly, "It would probably just be a giant cube with a duster arm."

02:42 Molly says to Constantine, "A naked robot?"

02:42 You say to Lily, "Can I come along just for the fun of it and observe?"

02:42 You grin.

02:43 Constantine Stone says, "If they can be thought of as being naked ever, sure I guess."

02:43 Evenia Callseah nods.

02:43 Evenia Callseah says, "Let's squish bari."

02:43 Lily says to you, "No you have to do all the work!"

02:43 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:43 You pout at Lily Kaise.

02:43 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

02:43 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ok let's do this!"

02:43 Molly Grant waves.

02:43 You grin.

02:43 Lily Kaise holds your hand, taking you into her group.

02:43 Lily Kaise waves to Molly Grant.

02:43 You wave to Molly Grant.

02:43 Lily Kaise holds Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into her group.

02:43 Lily Kaise holds Evenia Callseah's hand, taking her into her group.

02:43 You follow Lily Kaise out.

You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

02:43 The four-person mule "Daisy May" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

02:43 You follow Lily Kaise aboard the four-person mule "Daisy May".
[Starship "Daisy May"; Airlock]
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:43 You follow Lily Kaise into the ship.

02:43 [Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, and Emmylou the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

02:43 Constantine Stone walks south.

02:43 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:43 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:43 [Starship "Daisy May"; Main Deck]

02:43 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a felo nest, a small purple ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a sleeping large orange soldier felo, an octarine felo, an average-sized white felo, a hefty octarine felo kitten, a medium-sized white felo, a normal octarine felo, and a white felo here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

02:43 [Starship "Daisy May"; Docking Bay]

02:43 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, the aerial fortress and deployment station "Petunia", a sleeping average-sized orange soldier felo, and an obese octarine felo here.
You can go up.

02:44 [Aerial Fortress "Petunia"; Starship Access]

02:44 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Conjurer from storage and sets it in front of you.

02:44 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceiling, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

02:44 Evenia Callseah mosies in from the north.

02:44 Evenia Callseah presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves a RATS Nanite Integrator from storage and sets it in front of her.

02:44 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceiling, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

02:44 Evenia Callseah strokes a RATS Nanite Integrator lovingly.

02:44 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

02:45 Constantine Stone walks in from the north.

02:45 Constantine Stone presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AEU Combat Universalist from storage and sets it in front of him.

02:45 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceiling, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

02:45 Evenia Callseah says to you, "Best shit ever."

02:45 Constantine Stone pats an AEU Combat Universalist lightly.

02:45 You say to Evenia Callseah, "I need to get mine one of these days."

02:45 Evenia Callseah says to you, "I'll help."

02:45 You grin.

02:45 Evenia Callseah pats a RATS Nanite Integrator lightly.

02:45 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok this will be my first time tanking in this thing. I don't promise anything!"

02:45 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Laugh."

02:45 Constantine Stone presses a button on an AEU Combat Universalist, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

02:45 Evenia Callseah winces.

02:45 Evenia Callseah presses a button on a RATS Nanite Integrator, which splits open down the front. She carefully climbs inside.

02:45 You speak into the microphone.

02:45 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Everyone here?"

02:45 You speak into the microphone.

02:46 Evenia Callseah says, "Just don't hurt the fragile little rat..."

02:46 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

02:46 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."

02:46 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

02:46 Evenia Callseah says to a large expandable telescoping xenology container, "I can take even less damage than your AEU."

02:46 Evenia Callseah blinks.

02:46 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

02:46 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

02:46 Evenia Callseah says to Constantine Stone, "This can cake even less damage than your AEU."

02:46 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

02:46 You ask, "And they call the AEU a tin can?"

02:46 You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

02:46 You chuckle.

02:47 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

02:47 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh, this thing is tissuepaper."

02:47 Two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend from the ceiling and close around Constantine Stone (AEU Combat Universalist). The sealed drop pod is quickly hauled into position at the launch tube, then disappears at a high rate of speed.

02:47 You laugh.

02:47 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

02:47 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:47 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

02:47 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:47 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

02:47 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You see Constantine Stone (AEU Combat Universalist) here.
You can go south.

02:47 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Evenia Callseah (RATS Nanite Integrator).

02:48 You quickly take cover.

02:48 (6 seconds roundtime.)

02:48 Wait 1 second.

02:48 I don't understand that.

02:48 I don't understand that.

02:48 You appear from behind cover.

02:48 (6 seconds roundtime.)

02:48 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Lily Kaise (Testudinidae Monk).

02:48 You say, "Oops."

02:48 You chuckle.

02:48 You exclaim, "Hey, fancy meeting you all down here!"

02:48 Constantine Stone cheers.

02:48 Evenia Callseah grins.
Lily Kaise laughs.

02:48 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, uh, let me know what light stuff you want me to do."

03:15 Constantine Stone cheers.

03:15 I don't see "cocooon" here.

03:15 Lily Kaise lights her battlesuit's ascent rockets and begins speeding upwards.

03:15 I don't see "cocoon" here.

03:15 You light your battlesuit's ascent rockets and begin speeding toward the waiting aerial fortress.

03:15 (20 seconds roundtime.)

03:16 [Aerial Fortress "Petunia"; Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

03:16 The aerial fortress appears to be at Old Frontier Processor.
You see Lily Kaise (Testudinidae Monk) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
You rocket through the fortress's entrance hatch and stumble to a stop on the deck.
Constantine Stone abruptly rockets in through the entrance hatch, having returned from the surface, and stumbles to a stop on the deck.

03:16 Evenia Callseah abruptly rockets in through the entrance hatch, having returned from the surface, and stumbles to a stop on the deck.

03:16 Constantine Stone is standing here.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

03:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ather did anyone checkout the sector?"

03:16 Evenia Callseah emerges from the lift.

03:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's clear."

03:17 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sector stood down about a minute after it went on alert."

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Molly did."

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ah ok."

03:17 Evenia Callseah stretches.

03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Molly Grant transmits, "It was empty when I looked."

03:17 Constantine Stone says, "I assume the navy cleared it."

03:17 Constantine Stone takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural tangerine juice.

03:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Thanks as I didn't hear when it cleared."

03:18 Constantine Stone says, "So far from the turtle suit."

03:18 Constantine Stone says, "Assuming I can get it at all."

03:18 The aerial fortress suddenly fires its ascent thrusters, rocketing toward open space.

03:18 Evenia Callseah hugs Constantine Stone. "You'll get there."

03:18 Lily Kaise emerges from the lift.

03:18 Constantine Stone says, "Weird that you need more points to do the mission than you do to get a tier 5 suit."

03:18 Constantine Stone chuckles.

03:18 A quiet beep serves to notify you that the aerial fortress has completed repairs of all stored equipment.

03:18 Lily Kaise says, "Well I didn't kill anybody."

03:18 The vibrations of ascent start to ease off slightly as the aerial fortress moves into open space.

03:18 Evenia Callseah grins and nods.

03:18 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:18 That way is currently blocked for your safety.

03:18 Evenia Callseah says, "Nope."

03:18 Constantine Stone asks, "How does it work for the Accord, they can do it at any time, but the mission is just painfully long?"

03:18 Evenia Callseah says, "It's a fun suit to tank in."

03:18 That way is currently blocked for your safety.

03:18 Lily Kaise says, "I just wish I had a little more to attract."

03:18 At the top of its ascent, the aerial fortress gently comes into contact with "Daisy May" and the docking clamps snap into place.

03:18 [Starship "Daisy May"; Docking Bay]

03:18 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a hefty octarine felo kitten, and the aerial fortress and deployment station "Petunia" here.
You can go up.

03:18 [Starship "Daisy May"; Main Deck]

03:18 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a felo nest, a small purple ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a sleeping large orange soldier felo, an average-sized white felo, and a normal octarine felo here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

03:18 [Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]

03:18 You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, and Emmylou the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

03:19 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

03:19 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:19 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:19 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:19 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:19 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:19 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Thanks all!"

03:19 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

03:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:19 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:19 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Daisy May! Welcome to home space!"

03:19 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:19 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:19 Evenia Callseah mosies in from the south.

03:19 Constantine Stone says to Evenia Callseah, "Thanks, as always!"

03:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:19 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Daisy May. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:20 Evenia Callseah smiles at Constantine Stone. "You know it."

03:20 Constantine Stone says, "I might go grab a drink in the lounge."

03:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:20 [Starship "Daisy May"; Airlock]

03:20 You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:20 You exit the ship.

03:20 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The four-person mule "Daisy May" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

14:24 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

14:49 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

14:49 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

14:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

14:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:54 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 834" has jumped into the sector.

14:54 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 834! Welcome to home space!"

14:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:54 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:54 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:54 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

14:54 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:54 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

14:55 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:55 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

14:55 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:55 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:55 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

14:55 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:55 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

14:55 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Defensive Dissidence. Welcome to Accord space."

15:00 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

15:00 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:00 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

15:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:00 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

15:00 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:00 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:00 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

15:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:00 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:00 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

15:00 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

15:00 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

15:00 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Defensive Dissidence! Welcome to home space!"

15:00 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Defensive Dissidence. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

15:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:01 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:01 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:01 You scramble to your feet.

15:02 You carefully set about bolting an airlock chime to a convenient surface.

15:02 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

15:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

15:09  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case.

15:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

15:13 New Phoenix's heavy industry was especially hard hit by the bombardment of the city. Several years ago, factories, research facilities, and industrial parks populated the area north of here, but it is now closed to the public, and large signs mounted to high concrete barriers stretching across the north end of the street warn of various types of deadly hazards. Still, rebuilding is taking place, evident in the construction of several large warehouses nearby. Among them is a shiny new store, an elegant sign near the door reading, 'Blazing Trails.'

15:21 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

15:22 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:22 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:22 The ship is already moving.

15:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

15:22 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

15:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:23 Your communicator reports that...

15:23 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

15:23  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

15:23 You are carrying nothing.

15:23 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:23 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Defensive Dissidence. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:23 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:23 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:23 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.
(You are sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.)

(You are sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.)

18:29 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:29 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

18:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:29 The ship is already moving.

18:29 The ship is already moving.

18:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

18:29 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:29 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:29 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

18:29 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:29 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, Defensive Dissidence! Welcome to home space!"

18:29 There are no other ships in the sector.

18:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:30 The ship's current engine speed is 6316 km/s.

18:30 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 1.9 seconds.

18:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:30 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

18:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Defensive Dissidence. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:30 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:30 You peer out...

[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
The vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk", the three-person clipper "Obliteration", the two-person Accord gemini "Starfish", and the patriot "Defensive Dissidence" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

19:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Well enough, thank you. I have merely been salvaging and listening to the general chatter, so it has been quiet. And you?"

19:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah yes, the general chatter. Well don't take everything they say to heart. I know things look bad for us here, but it's not like they say."

19:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We tried to do a lot of things to change our predicament."

19:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Incidentally we failed repeatedly, and a lot of people like to think that if they were in our shoes they would have come out on top easily."

19:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Not to worry. I found most of the criticisms to be rather naive."

19:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if we could put in a bid on something."

19:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess probably not."

19:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather had said once that the corps is worth trillions of credits, but I wonder how much the individual operations are worth."

19:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I bet exploration could be bought for a song."

19:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Comparitively, I mean."

19:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Yes, I suspect that is the least-valuable of the bids. But I suspect the corporations putting in bids are willing to put forth sums beyond our capital. I could be wrong, though."

19:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you're probably right."

19:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "If we had the amount of money required to place bids, I think that would mean the government itself would have enough not to entertain the idea of privatization."

20:54 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

20:54 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

20:59 I don't understand that.
