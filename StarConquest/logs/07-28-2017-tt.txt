Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

You blink heavily and then doze off.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One
performance goal down! One to go!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What? Still no headlines?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nope."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Man I dunno why I
haven't done this in ages. I didn't realize how much I missed it."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What haven't you done in
ages?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "A full load of
comets. Like nothing but. It takes a while, but I enjoy it."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Comets are the best."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I have a little over
123000 units of storage. So...yeah. it takes a while."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Shipwrecks are my
total favorite, but comets come in a close second."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The accord sends me to get
lots of medium-size outsider wrecks now."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The missions are so great,
like 3 of them fill my ship up."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh, accord missions
rock."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I totally gaped when
I got my first large outsider wrecks. Like...2 of them. and my ship was full. I
was like..."Um. holy shit?""
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "I agree about wrecks. That's
why I love 777 more than anywhere else when it comes to salvaging."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Damn right. That's
why I've put so much effort into keeping that place around, even though plenty
of folks don't like it. I love it out there, even now."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh that place is great."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't go to the bubble
yet but I'm going to miss 777 once I can, I think."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I probably won't go out
there as much."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Haven't been there yet.
Probably don't have the grappler grade for it."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's still worth
going out there for the wrecks. Plenty of artifacts at the bubble, but not a
single bit of salvage."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Lexie, can you
grapple grade 20 to 40?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think 40 might be good
for a grapple."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ahh then maybe I do."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do stealth modules
do?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like for stations."
[Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'd rather respond
to that here. Those modules make a station appear smaller. So that it attracts
less attention from things like outsiders. IFS. And the like."
[Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So that's good to have."
[Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If you're worried
about the station attracting attention, sure. But I don't normally use them
unless it's for maybe a beacon, or if I'm really trying to fit every org on a
station."
[Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are they expensive?"
[Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nah."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If you wanna take a
look at prices and things for station parts, you could always poke your nose
into the module shop on accord, get an idea for things."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I should do
that."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm making the 285
asteroid processor."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cooking up a station."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles. "Don't forget
Nicolette's org."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Or she'll attack with
claws."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In Lily's instructions,
she wouldn't list Nicolette's org by name."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I was looking over
everything she wrote and I was like huh, she never said which org it was."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's the shit org."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I found out in the
end."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Right Nicolette?"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "What?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Nothing just talking shit."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If you're ever after
any parts from her and Lily doesn't have any. Feel free to check our spare parts
ship. She always keeps it full of shit."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I should be a core on
Lily's constructor."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Or should have one that
is."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, there's one from
you in there."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "That's the core you use
on the processor at 285. That's why it's there."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The only thing I had to
get from another ship was a stealth module from rift surfers."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But that's why you
have a key. Trust me when I tell you, sometimes us station builders have to go
station building ship raiding. Sometimes you gotta scrounge parts from anywhere
you can."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sometimes it feels
like you're hunting for a needle in a stack of needles. It's like. "Okay. I need
a seekers battery. Nope. None on that ship. Or that one. Or that one...fuck
sakes.""
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, Lily's constructor
is like some kind of ridiculous junkyard."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might never be heard
from again if I take a wrong turn down here."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "She prefers the term unclaimed
reclaimed salvagable components depot."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You think that's bad?
You should see how Mel's ship looks sometimes. Or hell, our main building ship
for that matter. I've had 28 modules on that thing more than once. I'm
like...Holy crap."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Now. The cats spare
parts ship...walk carefully. that shit is scary."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh, Nicolette?"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "What?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Nothing just talking shit."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence sighs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Do you need me to
check on the 288 stuff, at some point soon?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Honestly I have no idea I was
ignoring it."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Nah, with so many gone,
not gonna worry about it."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sure thing."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's in 288?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And hush with that
sighing, Nicolette. You make more shit jokes than all of us put together."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "If they calla nd ask for
an accelerator to be put out there, I'll do it, but I assume they'll come back
more or less the way they went."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Shit is the shit. No
shit."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh dear."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This list says RUNE is
supposed to contribute the control center, but I don't see one on their ship."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "When is it going
down?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe in another 16 hours
or so."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Rune is a joke. Get
another one and forget about it, they don't get anything really from being on
the station in the first place."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Okay. If you've got
around 16 hours. Send Keegan a letter. Letting him know you need a top. If you
still don't have one closer to the time. Use another part."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "If there's not one where
it's supposed to be, don't worry about them, that's not your job."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "She's right!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys are both right!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well no, but it's 16
hours. That's a fair amount of time for him to get a top."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I don't mind
shooting him a letter."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got nothing going on."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If a station has a
good amount of time, that's what I usually do. I'll also nudge him if I see him
awake, and let him know that rune needs more tops on their ship."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But if a station
doesn't have long...I always do what Nicolette said. if there's no part from the
org, they don't get on it, it's that simple. If you can't keep parts on your
ship, that's not the station builders problem."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Harsh is the world of
station building."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Heavy lies the station
top."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Meodramatic is the
Constantine."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It is. But I'm not
screwing around letting stations go down. Just so that they can be perfect. Keep
your shit up to date on your spare parts ship. And you won't have a problem with
me. Meaning orgs in general. Of course."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I get that."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wanted to do it early

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

many saw my broadcast last night, I think? Unless this is why Dannikin is asking
culwyn to step down perhaps. That name sounds awfully familiar."

am not sure that we have met? You also sound a bit familiar."

was... Can't recall off hand, it's too early still."

Miss Cullwyn has been the only opposition to Outccord, at least in the media."

to thank her in my broadcast, though who knws, that might have done her more
harm than good."

more publically noticable of they want to have an impact. Maybe that's what

of flack to deal with lately."

possible. I'm not sure how to feel about this news. It could be good, or it
could be bad.. I'm gonna see what I can find out about Mister Dannikin, that
name is really familiar. I'm almost positive I've seen it in the news at some
point."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are

stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Rest well Tara."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ha! AEU comms
supremacy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting
headline."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You look at
this, Eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I did eaf the
headline onstatine, sorry I couldn't get to my comms."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though, I'm
unsure whether this is good or bad. Culwyn,  so far has been the only one to
speak publicly about being in opposition to Outccord, but perhaps Dannikin
believes she should be doing more."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My thoughts
exactly, I don't dislike Culwyn, but this could still be good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The party has
kind of been dragging its feet because it isn't really united behind Culwyn."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Very true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I wonder
how van Dannikin would react if he knew about the livestock restrictions we were
trying ot get out of."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Bet he and the
party would really hate that."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, no dbout. Though
I'm sure they're likely aware."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you're
probably right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We'll have to
see what happens, I'm going to go through the news archive and see what I can
find out about Danikin."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might come
look for you later and talk about this, Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, if I have
time.. I might be a bit busy today."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, no
worries."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anyone know if doing
Accord missions actually does anything for our respective alliances?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Shit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I knew that
name sounded familiar, fucking hell."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Dannikin is the Union
spokesperson who's heading the Outccord campaign, this is no good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Dannikin is
the Union spokesperson who's heading the Outccord campaign, this is no good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He's the guy
saying that we spend the ludicrous sum of 500 billion a week on the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey growls.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It doesn't make sense..
One minute Dannikin is leading the Union on Outccord, then the enxt he's telling
culwyn to step down and let someone capable of real oppisition take over. don't
do it culwyn! don't do it!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you are
hearing this, or if it reaches your ears Miss Culwyn, don't step down! We need
you!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you're
right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Dannikin just
wants you to step down so that there's no opposition at all! Please,  don't!"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met our
first tier performance goal! Let's keep pushing for the second!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, you
around, ELi?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry about
that."
[MTTS] Ulias: That can be closed, I thought it would give the "is this a thanks"
response.
[MTTS] Ulias: On a die note, I'm having the time of my life with these current
storylines.
[MTTS] Ulias: Er.. side note.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sorry..
constantine, did you say something?"
[MTTS] Squidmind: What's that you say, you want people to die in the plot?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I thought
we might talk through this Culwyn situation if you have a minute."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though we could
discuss it over comms, I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So my
understanding of the situation was flawed."
[MTTS] me: No death.
[MTTS] Ulias: Hahahahah.
[MTTS] me: Unless... well Hehehehe. Unless it is warranted?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think
that Culwyn and the rest of the party know about the negotiations van Dannikin
is carrying out?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Absolutely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not just that
he's the negotiator, but specifically that he's trying to get the Union out of
environmental regulations?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think we
made an assumption that Dannikin was party of the Green Earth party, I don't
believe he is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think this
was the opposing party calling her competence into question."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ohh, that makes
sense."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know why
I instantly assumed he was part of some faction within the green party that
opposes Culwyn."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well the
headline kinda sound that way at first."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, well maybe
this could unite the green party a bit more, then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hearing their
enemies publicly calling for their leader's removal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, or
they'll use it to support her argument."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er their
argument."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's
also possible."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's been
some rumors that they want to replace her, they may see this as an opportunity
to do that. Though with her party not being fully behind her, she doesn't strike
me as a woman who will simply step down because someone says that she should. I
hope she doesn't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If she does,
I hope whoever takes her place, is ready to step up and fight for the Accord."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, a strong
Green Earth would really help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The simple
fact that Dannikin has called for her to step down, simply proves that she is
capable of the opposition he claims that she is not capable of. At least to me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean
really, if you are winning, then why would someone ask for someone to better
oppose them. It doesn't make sense."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed, he would
never say that to anyone who he thought wasn't a threat."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say
standards are two fighters and a corvette most of the time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And lows are
just fighters usually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, might
want to use a rental fighter though, they're little stronger than the ones you
have access to currently."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, that's
a good point."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can get
rentals from Tannhauser Gate."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know if
you're aware, but one thing to worry about with beacons is getting chains
attached to your ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They limit your
movement and prevent your escape if things go south."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So be aware of
that, and try to prioritize whatever is currently chaining you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll know when
something does chain you, and you can see who it was if you forgot by hitting
the 'scan' button and scanning the ships."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The scans report
who's chaining what."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's also no
shame in leaving for repairs if you have to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, and
honestly if you get stuck, there's folks that would come save you, though it
will attract more enemy ships if it comes to that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "On another note, How
would I get started on the crafting stuff you mentioned, Eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Go out of the
West exit of the spacesport, and then Head North a few blocks on Soviet. There's
a craftsmen store there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It'll take a
while before you have enough money to buy all the licenses though, so for the
moment you'll be able to just make components probably, depending on what
license you get first."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's still
nice to have the workbench though, that way you can start disassembling the
stuff you are getting from beacons. Start collecting parts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm hoping that
I'll eventually be able to build a robot servant who will pick up my collected
scrap and go disassemble it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are there
blueprints for robots like that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think
so, as far as I know you have to disassemble things yourself. Though the service
and arachnoid robots can craft simple things for you while you sleep or do other
things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Very handy
for making circuit boards, and things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Man, a
disassembling robot would be so good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So in
summary,  no disassemble robots."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Does the workbench
help you gather parts on only the ship you put it on?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can carry
it around with you, and siassemble parts whereever."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, the choices of
liscening are interesting..Hm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I forget which
one makes circuit boards."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That one is
pretty good to start with."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's probably
electronics."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that
sounds right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Electronics
makes circuit boards, but you also need plastic boards to make them and
chemistry to make them into etched plastic boards."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you want
to be able to make things right away, your best bets are probably metals and
plastics, then you'll at least be able to make some containers and starship
decorations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I went with utility
and electronics."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I like
utility and you can always ask others for parts if you want to make some of the
stuff in there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Definetly going to
have to buy nice clothes later."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Vernos, if
you get time, will you find out how much money the alliance gets from it's
pilots doing Accord missions?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will certainly
ask."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They got a bit short
with me over asking about reduced penalities for you guys."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They always
tend to be pretty short about everything, unless a longer response is
warranted."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Nah this short
answer felt like them trying to take my soul."

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a decoy
beacon launcher here.
You can go up and out.

value anywhere trading occurs.
[MTTS] usfolks: Could you guys possibly add some of that to the trading help
file? Because I seriously doubt that's well-known and probably should be.
[MTTS] alc_71: It's been done before. Some give up and others don't but yeah,
probably isn't well known.
[MTTS] usfolks: Well I had no idea...and didn't get a response to my support in
time to not do what I did. It really would have been nice to know.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I didn't know that. So a trade item can be taken to another
trading location, and traded?
[MTTS] Squidmind: Of course. If it has value at one place, it'll have value
elsewhere.
[MTTS] usfolks: I suppose when two hours later there was still no one for it,
and I tried for the better part of an hour after that, there was no way I could
know that an intermediate item could be used to begin a chain elsewhere. So if
we don't know...there's no way we can do anything about it.
[MTTS] usfolks: Anyway, what's done is done, all I'm asking is that something
like that be added to the trading help file so others don't do what I did just
plain not knowing.
