Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a greater minimodule of damage capacity and projectile boost, a greater

Disruption, Harassment, and Discrimination
Star Conquest frequently involves conflict with other characters. We understand
the frustration when things don't go your way, and when another character is
becoming the bane of your existence. However, you must always be sure that your
argument is with that other character, and not with the real person behind him
or her.
   - Any interaction with other characters, even (or especially) when you're
angry, should be fully in character, unless you mutually agree to break
character.
   - It's generally a bad idea to address any comments, particularly angry ones,
to the player behind a character without some kind of permission or invitation,
even privately. Such things could get you in trouble if the other player feels
uncomfortable as a result.
   - Even if your retribution against another character is technically in
character, you should take care that your punishment does not unduly affect the
player's ability to play. As an example, it's technically possible and even,
technically, in character to strand a person far out in uncharted space from
which he or she has no hope of ever returning. For obvious reasons, however,
this is illegal. At the end of any conflict, all players involved should still
retain the opportunity to progress their characters.
   - Squidsoft.net maintains a zero tolerance attitude towards interaction in
the vein of racism, discrimination, sexual harassment, and homophobia.  We seek
to provide a comfortable gaming atmosphere, and having to be subjected to
scrutiny because of racial, cultural, gender identity, disability or sexual
orientation damages not only the integrity of the gaming environment, but also
the person being discriminated against.
   - It's also walking a thin line to have your character be racist, homophobic,
etc. even if you aren't. We strongly recommend against it. We're especially
reluctant to accept this as an excuse after the fact.
   - Remember that conflict is an aspect of roleplaying. This goes both ways,
because while a "victim" player should not complain about properly roleplayed
conflict, nor should an "aggressor" player attempt to spark a conflict without
it being a justifiable part of their character. What this specifically refers to
is players who connect to the game just to harass other players verbally,
attempt to grab and strand random players, or attempt to steal or destroy ships,
but do not roleplay or even play the game much at all. Players who start a
conflict should be involved in their characters and therefore have something to
lose themselves. But the act of connecting to a game, not out of interest in
playing it but just to cause havoc and watch the reaction, has a specific name:
trolling. The staff will not tolerate this and we'll step in as necessary.
   - Generally and most importantly, when engaging in player vs. player
conflict, we ask that you keep your actions somewhat in proportion with the
situation. For example, if your character is insulted on the comms, it is
probably not a proper response to pursue that player across the galaxy, destroy
all of his ships, and end up holding him hostage on an abandoned, airless
station somewhere indefinitely. We recognize that different characters will have
different levels of response, but at the end of every conflict, everyone
involved should be able to pick up the pieces and resume progressing through the
game. Make sure that your actions are merely part of a conflict between
characters, and that your intention isn't to somehow punish the player behind
that character.
   - Harassment which spills out into the real world, even just the real
"online" world, is taken extremely seriously, and instances of this often leave
us no choice but to ban the player who cannot keep the worlds separate. This is
partially the reason why we encourage players to play a character separate from
themselves. If a player proves that they do not have the capability to separate
IC from OOC, they likely do not belong in this game.
