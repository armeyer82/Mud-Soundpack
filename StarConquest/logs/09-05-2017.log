00:00:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says nothing to you.

00:01:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "-shule so they are building another op station in 274. I'm really pretty bored with just sitting around. Would you mind going out there to at least hangout?"

00:01:58 You exclaim, "Sure, let's!"

00:02:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok I am sorry but I am getting cabbin fever with this strike."

00:03:50 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Yeah, me too really. I understand."

00:04:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was busy with setting up the warehouse but tha's done now."

00:04:15 You say, "Ah, ok."

00:04:17 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

00:04:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That was a lot of work."

00:04:28 You say, "I have mail though so I'd like to check that before we leave."

00:05:16 You grin.

00:05:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it's ok. I don't know I guess it would have been helpful if someone other than me had loaded the modules but it's done now."

00:06:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't know the details but seems Constantine blew up the prototype they gave him."

00:06:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I advised against it though."

00:08:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I'm rather disappointed. I honestly almost demoted him."

00:08:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I won't but it's disturbing."

00:10:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He said he didn't think they would care. I beg to differ and it probably means that they won't likely release it to the rest of us."

00:11:16 You nod. "Well, we'll see what they do."

00:12:17 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

00:56:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:56:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:56:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:56:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:56:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:56:16 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:56:17 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:56:32 Via general sector communication, Wandering Soul transmits a text-based transmission: "don't wait for your turn to be ignored. Best must be stopped"

00:56:42 Via general sector communication, Wandering Soul transmits a text-based transmission: "oh it's you. Hi shule"

00:56:46 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 927" has jumped into the sector.

00:56:48 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "Hey there."

00:56:49 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 927! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

00:56:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:56:53 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:56:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:56:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:56:58 You must be in space to send a general sector transmission.

00:57:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:57:08 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

00:57:08 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:57:36 --

00:57:36 Ali and Erik,
You've been given Standard access to SEAS Warehouse.
For this next build and deployment of the Asteroid Processor and Rift Accelerator in 288, we are willing to provide a Fission breeder reactor module for the Asteroid processor. i have some Cores stored which i have purchased in my name which if you don't mind an AEU core on an Accelerator, then feel free to use them or any other module which has my name on it or SEAS. Otherwise I can load a Basic Control Center for a Top for the Accelerator or whatever you need except we won't contribute Passive Beacons at this time. If you absolutely need a Passive Beacon, please inquire first.
As for the trial basis, pleas include us on the next build and we'll observe the results. If they aren't sufficient, we'll likely not want to participate but occasionally as we don't have as high of a balance in Megacredits as other organizations and we're still under 2000 Command and although we have ample Credits, we aren't yet able to convert Credits to Megacredits and the Fission Breeder Reactor costs 10 Megacredits, hence it's one of the most pricey Modules.
If you need anything and I'm not available, feel free to call upon Shule, Constantine or Tara to load necessary Modules. Tara is a new Pilot so she may need a little coaching but she's very capable.
We'll let you know if we will continue to participate in tine prior to the deployment of the next Asteroid Processor.
Rega
00:57:36 rds,
Lily Kaise

I won't keep on about it, this'll be the last time I bring it up, but I really wish you'd send a statement to ISN about the fighter. So far the only folks that know are the government and they're not goign to tell a soul. Just make it something short that can't be twisted if it makes you nervous."

01:02:30 I don't understand that.

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:02:58 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:02:59 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:02:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:03:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:03:00 There appear to be about 14 pilots recently active.

01:03:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:03:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:03:06 There is little point in launching, since the ship is already in space.

01:03:14 
Wandering Soul..........................(9, 14, 19)

01:03:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:03:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:03:20 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:03:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

01:03:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, I'll think about it. Shule, can you get me a copy of the destruction report?"

01:03:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:03:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:03:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:03:27 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:03:28 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

01:03:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:03:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it comes from me, it will definintely get twisted."

01:03:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:03:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:03:32 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:03:35 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

01:03:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, shoot. I just stamped it."

01:03:57 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

01:03:57 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:03:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think you even need the report to be honest. Just a simple letter would work."

01:04:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries."

01:04:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:04:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I can just see this blowing up in my face."

01:04:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

06:16:56 Minor Change: By popular demand, organizations can now be added to warehouse ACLs.

06:17:33 [MTTS] alc_71: Yea, thanks.

06:17:47 [MTTS] Butchulla: Brilliant.

06:18:51 [MTTS] Ulias: How popular was the demand? We talkin prom king here? Or just like.. guy who is kinda cool and most folks know at least a little about him.

06:19:09 [MTTS] Squidmind: Several tickets.

06:19:37 [MTTS] Squidmind: There's a lot of tickets requesting different ordering and formatting styles for warehouses, and we want to get to them, but that's a lot easier said than done.

06:20:14 [MTTS] Ulias: Well this recent change sounds like it will certainly make things easier on folks, if it means what I think it means.

06:20:36 [MTTS] alc_71: It sure will.

06:20:44 [MTTS] Butchulla: Well I've got no doubt you guys are doing what you can. Either way, these warehouses just make life a hundred times easier.

06:20:58 [MTTS] Squidmind: It means that you can allow, say, CUSTOM as a whole instead of every single member of the org manually.

06:21:49 [MTTS] Butchulla: Which means a ton less messing about, and confusion.

06:24:21 [MTTS] Squidmind: It puts everything in one place, and the number of ships named something 'Mega Deep Dicking Them Spare Stations' has decreased slightly.

06:24:52 [MTTS] Squidmind: Named something like, rather.

06:25:16 [MTTS] Butchulla: You guys are making our lives so easy, that pretty soon people will be asking why stations aren't building themselves.

06:25:36 [MTTS] alc_71: I imagine there has been a decent reduction of database bloat.

06:25:47 [MTTS] Butchulla: I'd hope so, at least.

06:26:03 [MTTS] Squidmind: We noticed that it was practically becoming a full-time job for some people, and that expedited implementation of the warehouse system.

06:26:39 [MTTS] alc_71: I am sure those people are quite thankful and happy.

06:26:59 [MTTS] Butchulla: I'm quite sure they are too.

06:28:04 [MTTS] Squidmind: We never intended stations to be both a practically a permanent fixture and constant busy work when we set out to implement them.

06:29:46 [MTTS] alc_71: When the accelerators got added in, that increased the workload. At least, that is how it seems to be. But it's a nice set up.

06:29:55 [MTTS] Butchulla: Now if we could please have temp station launchers...

06:30:01 [MTTS] Butchulla: Kidding, kidding.

06:30:17 [MTTS] Squidmind: Those used to be a thing! And practically still are, if you're AEU.

06:30:35 [MTTS] alc_71: If we go to war with the AEU, maybe we can nab the constructors. Kidding. Haha.

06:31:19 [MTTS] Butchulla: Hahaha. Nice thought. If only we could all have those nice toys. I think then most people wouldn't have a single complaint.

06:33:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

06:33:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks heavily and then dozes off.

06:33:29 [MTTS] Squidmind: Old temps could also be linked together if adjacent.

06:33:59 [MTTS] alc_71: Oh that would be neat.

06:34:07 [MTTS] Butchulla: It would be.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a pair of violet red leather boots decorated with neon red stars here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

I sure hoped that Constantine would at least have watched the Range Office and taken it out there. So when I came into work, I only had those few hours to be here. Ather and Eli were in protest by the aEU Tower. I had to get that beacon up so Ather wasn't happy. I just turned off my comm because first off, the comm gets garbled as you travel out there and I didn't want Johann yelling at me. So I felt caught in the middle."
