00:13:32 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:13:33 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

02:00:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Our performance was up 27.9% from the last Conquest period."

02:01:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey stands before an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop and looks into the camera with a grim expression. He says, "Greetings once again fellow citizens of the Union and to the rest of humanity that may be tuned in."

02:02:11 I can't find someone with the name 'cesar'.

02:02:38 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, ""We're here once again to talk to you about the strike against Outccord, and the recent events surrounding it. As has been stated over and over on these broadcasts, Outccord is a danger to the continued existance of humanity. This alone is a good enough reason to bring the negotiations to a full end.""

02:03:26 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It's not, however the only reason. Citizens of the Union, we seem to now have a leader who thinks he can do whatever he wants with our alliance and it's people. He's continued to punish us and cast us aside for simply disagreeing and offering alternatives. If the way the pilot corps has been treated is any indicator for how the rest of the population is being treated, then I truly pray for us all."

02:04:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ather and I were rogued, for simply speaking our opinion and assisting in the rescue of several innocent unreg families. Our liaisons were removed from office and had their names dragged through the mud. Other pilots were given commendations and praised in the presf, twisting their words to make it seem like they support Best, in an attempt to turn us against each other. Not once has a reasonable attempt at diplomacy been made by the government to address these issues. Only attacks and misdirection. Much of this could have been avoided had the government just acknowledged our concerns and attempted to explain their sideing and offering alternatives. If the way the pilot corps has been tr."

02:05:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "The pilot corps have not been the only ones handled this way. Senators Donovan and Bates of Hyperion are under investigation for terrorism, for simply wanting to avoid future conflicts on the world they represent. I believe representing their citizens is the very definition of their job, something Best clearly doesn't know anything about. I wonder who will get accused of terrorism next for saying something the president doesn't like?"

02:06:06 Eli's eyes flash angrily, "now they have even removed our beloved liaison Andrew Lambeth from office. A fine example of a man who has always been there for the corps. whether offering helpful advice, or a stern matter-of-fact warning, mister Lambeth has always done an excellent job at guiding the corps in the right direction. None of what has happened is Andrew lambeth's fault. Best is using him as a scapegoat to hide the facts. they claim that it was the pilot delegation sent to negotiate the QSA who have caused the recent tensions between the Union and the Mutuality. so they're removing Lambeth to make some kind of example out of him."on of their job, someth.

02:07:24 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I think anyone who has been following the news knows the real reason that tensions are so high. The Union flotilla that skirted the Mutuality border has a lot to do with it. There was no one held accountable for an entire flotilla being somewhere that it wasn't supposed to be. Combine that with Best's current attempt to get out of the Accord, which restricts naval movements to prevent such things, is enough to make anyone tense. A QSA meeting that didn't come to a deal is pale by comparison. Perhaps if the QSA was so important to Best he should have sent someone to begin with,  like the other alliances did. No matter how you look at it, Best is the one to blame for the tensions, plain an dsimple.on of their job, someth."

02:07:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:08:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "These wreckless, selfish decisions must be stopped, before they come down on all of our heads! The recent E. Danikin scandal only proves this. He sent a man who was all ready to jump in his escape pod once things went bad to negotiate for our future. It's been very apparent how important Outccord is to president Best, often it seems as though it's all he cares about. Yet this is who he sends to do it? Either Best knew about that escape plan, or he didn't. Either one of those is unacceptable. Apparently he couldn't be bothered to do some simple research on a man he was sending to pull us out of humanity's only chance for salvation against our alien enemies. Unless of course, it's the more sinister option. I won't speculate on those details, what matters is this... How can we trust a president that seems to do whatever he wants, no matter how hapazard it may be? especially when he insists on ignoring and condemning any disagreement with his actions?on of their job, someth."

02:09:27 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The negotiations have only been put on hold because of this. On hold. Best's only response to this has been to say that he would find the greatest negotiator to make the greatest deal. Is this not what the criteria for Danikin was as well? And will this new negotiator simply step in and continue with what Danikin has already started? Something that Danikin himself clearly thought was a bad enough idea to have planned a way out? This madness has to end now!on of their job, someth."

02:10:36 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Even if you don't care about Outccord at all, this still concerns you. If we let this man get this foothold, he'll know that he can do whatever he wants and that all he has to do is ignore any debate that contradicts him. Don't wait until it's your turn to be ignored or made an example out of. Best's wreckless decision making is going to bring disaster on all of us. Don't let him take our union for himself, from right under our noses."

02:11:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The strike will continue until Best is stopped. We will continue to dissuade merchants from trading and will not bring any money for the Union until Outccord is called off entirely. We have no confidence in Best's decision making. Best's competency should be called into question. His decisions should be reevaluated by all members of government. We simply can't let him make such a dangerous choice for the Union. Simply put, Best does not know best."

02:12:24 Eli takes a deep breath before continueing, "the pilot corps can see reason however, despite our presidents unwillingness or inability to do so. Even with this longer list of glaring complaints, we will end the strike if Outccord is called off. Abandoning Outccord and agreeing to work with all members of government to find a solution that does not involve leaving the Accord will end the strike. That being said, I hope that members of all political parties have taken notice of his actions during Outccord and have seen the kind of man, and leader, that he really is."s.

02:13:22 The ripples on Eli's skin slow to their normal pace, having grown erratic during the course of him speaking, "We have no more trust in Best at all. He wants to pull our resources out of the Accord at a time when threats loom over every horizon. the Accord is our only chance of staying safe from Outsiders, IFS, and replicators. Just the other day a monitored swarm reached over two billion units. Does the Union really not want to assist in protecting us all from such threats? Outcord must be stopped. Best must be stopped."s.

02:14:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "People watching out there, you're the the only ones who can stop this. Whether you are against Outccord,  or you're for it, one thing we can all agree on is that none of us asked for the Union to become one man's plaything. Demand accountability, demand an end to Outccord. Help us all find our way back to normalcy."

02:14:43 Eli glances over the other pilots, "do any of you have anything you would like to add?

02:14:54 Patriot Constantine Stone clears his throat.

02:14:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:15:02 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Merchant pilots, please don't do business in Union ports."

02:15:14 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Every credit spent or load of goods brought in is more money in Best's pocket."

02:15:22 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "And more fuel to the fire he's burning our alliance down with."

02:15:25 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

02:15:34 Eli nods solemnly to Constantine.

02:15:49 Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident nods solemnly.

02:16:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well unless anyone has anything else, I think we've said what we came here to say."

02:17:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Everyone out there watching, I hope you have heeded these words. Do what you can to make your voices heard. May you all find peace and joy in your lives..."

02:17:16 -shule, Lily, Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin, and Constantine come to stand next to Eli, In unison, they thrust their fists into the air and exclaim, "for the Union, the Accord, and humanity!"

02:17:57 Eli and the other pilots leave the studio, leaving an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop hanging on the screen.

02:18:23 You say to Eli, "Good job as usual."

02:18:27 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey beams.

02:18:34 Patriot Constantine Stone pats Rogue Pilot Eli Grey on the back.

02:18:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You said what I wanted you to say about the QSA failure too."

02:18:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'm glad you guys think so, hopefully it did some good, and not harm."

02:18:35 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Great work."

02:18:42 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "We'll see what happens."

02:18:49 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Now, Dak, if you have a moment, I'll ask you to witness my counting the proposal results."

02:19:21 Dakhal says to Eli, "You said pretty much everything that needed to be said regarding what's happened lately."

02:19:29 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin says, "Excluding rogue robot ace pilots."

02:19:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snaps his fingers.

02:19:45 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin glances down at his sleek silver watch with sapphire accents momentarily.

02:19:49 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Sometimes short can be sweet."

02:19:50 I see no "watch" here.

02:19:53 a gold wrist-mounted chronometer
It covers nothing.
You glance down at your watch, noting the time:

02:20:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Oh damn were they're mistakes, I didn't even stop to see how it was coming out once I started having problems."

02:20:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, OOCly, "Don't worry about it."

02:21:27 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:21:44 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin says, "Eli does the hard part, really. We just get to be the classic film stand-ins."

02:21:45 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:21:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "How did I get anything from the trust fund. I did absolutely nothing the past two conquests."

02:21:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:21:58 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin says, "Although it does say something that literally all the of the current office holders were in there."

02:22:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ha! I'm glad you guys are ok, I was thinking halfway through that I thought, "you know, I really should have cleared what i'm saying with these guys, hope they're not mad." It's a releif to hear that you were pleased."

02:22:17 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

02:22:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No it was everything I wanted to hear."

02:22:36 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey beams.

02:22:37 You say to Eli, "You did great."

02:22:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Somebody had to blast him for putting the QSA blame on us and so much more."

02:22:53 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:22:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah, it' total bullshit."

02:22:59 You nod and nod.

02:23:34 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I mean, hell, the subject of the meeting was the tensions, how could they have even existed before they're cause? It's absurd."

02:23:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Very much so."

02:23:47 You say, "And I won't let any merchant ships pass."

02:24:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "No with my mouth!"

02:24:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:24:44 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "The patriot, turning away merchants."

02:24:47 You laugh at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:24:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "Hey thanks for the ship, let me just use this to run off more merchants you idiots."

02:24:59 You chuckle at Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:25:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Prototype."

02:25:42 You say, "Oh yeah, show Lily. She hasn't gotten to se.e."

02:25:45 You say, "See."

02:25:47 Constantine says to Lily, "It's a bit like the cadet fighter, but it has 6 turrets and a 5% laser bonus."

02:25:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:25:49 You say, "And I can't talk."

02:25:53 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I don't see any reason why they can't still make those, even if we stay in the Accord."

02:25:54 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin says, "It's honestly kinda cool."

02:25:56 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, come have a look."

02:26:03 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah, I dig it."

02:26:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It's pretty awesome."

02:26:52 You say, "Oh crap, glad nobody called me."

02:26:53 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin says, "Or just ignore the laser bonus and load that baby up on vulcans."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Did you bring it? The Patriot?"

02:26:53 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin grins.

02:26:59 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I have it docked here."

02:27:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh yeah me too! Wow."

02:27:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I discourage most phonecalls so."

02:27:18 You nod.

02:27:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins. "I had mine silenced."

02:27:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I actually had someone call me during one off those broadcasts."

02:27:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

02:27:47 Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

02:27:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "About the only one who calls me anymore is Melinda or Johann and Melinda is out in deep space and Johann rarely does."

02:27:50 You say, "Yeah, I remember."

02:27:53 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ijust tossed the phone in my bag real quick."

02:27:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:28:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is all you can do."

02:28:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Oh jeez, that was the transport broadcast wasn't it?"

02:28:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

02:28:15 You say, "I think so."

02:28:19 You chuckle.

02:28:52 You say, "Ather about killed the person over General for calling Eli."

02:29:21 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin says, "That's rather roguish behaviour."

02:29:26 Patriot Constantine Stone chuckles.

02:29:33 You chuckle.

02:29:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I am amazed at Ather's restraint towards Vernos."

02:30:49 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I mean folks were pissed at him, but he was acting like folks were going to beat him with batons and stuff."

02:30:57 You say, "I think he hid in his office or something for like days."

02:31:02 You chuckle.

02:31:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well if we didn't have certain rules of conduct..."

02:31:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.

02:31:26 Eli says to Lily, "Even still, you'r ejust one person. He was acting like the entire galaxy was out to beat on him."

02:31:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Heh that's good!"

02:31:36 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "He was."

02:31:37 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

02:31:41 You laugh.

02:31:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I hope he fears every breth that jerk takes."

02:31:59 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smirks.

02:32:02 You say, "And Lily wasn't even here for a couple of weeks."

02:32:06 You say, "At least."

02:32:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah haha."

02:32:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh the comfort of deep space."

02:32:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well at least he's been striking and runningoff merchants. That's a decent start to becoming a better person."

02:32:39 You grin.

02:32:43 You say, "True."

02:32:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh well he has a lot to prove to me."

02:32:54 Eli says to Dakhal, "No offense Dak, I didn' tmean that the way it came off. You're alright."

02:32:57 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey pats Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin on the back.

02:33:01 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin blinks.

02:33:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I doubt he will ever become less selfish."

02:33:07 Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

02:33:16 Dakhal says to Eli, "I think I might have missed whatever potential insult was there."

02:33:21 You chuckle.

02:33:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:33:27 Eli says to Dakhal, "Your reasons for not striking are valid ones. I would't want someone to violate their principles."

02:33:32 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Alright guys, I gotta get those results tabbed, then get back to sleep."

02:33:36 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:33:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey pats Patriot Constantine Stone on the back.

02:33:42 Constantine says to Eli, "When I count the results, will I get some kind of paper copy?"

02:33:44 Lily says to Constantine, "Ok show me that shp sometime."

02:33:48 You wave to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:33:48 Patriot Constantine Stone nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:33:57 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin says, "I'll meet you on New Earth, Con."

02:34:00 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

02:34:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey shakes his head at Patriot Constantine Stone. "No, but it becomes part of the public record, you'll probably have to wirte your own letter."

02:34:14 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Er write."

02:34:28 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

02:34:31 Patriot Constantine Stone waves.

02:34:32 Lily says to Constantine, "You actually don't have to."

02:34:33 You wave to Patriot Constantine Stone.

02:34:39 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey arches an eyebrow.

02:34:44 Constantine says to Lily, "What do you mean?"

02:34:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I didn't for any I put up."

02:35:07 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I mean for getting the results to the news."

02:35:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The liaison office took charge of it and reported it."

02:35:14 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Not the office."

02:35:15 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I doubt they'll report this."

02:35:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh, writing to ISN about it? That's just an extra part since the office hasn't beeen publishing our stuff."

02:35:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "True well then see if you can tally them."

02:35:32 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Nothing about my or Vernos's interactions that I've read on the terminal suggests to me they'll do anything bu tignore this."

02:35:35 Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin says, "We don't really have a liaison officer right now, or at least that I know of."

02:35:37 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "But yeah, she's right, when things are right you don't have to do that."

02:35:46 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "But they are very, very wrong at the moment."

02:35:49 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

02:35:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah but some things are automated but yeah you are right."

02:35:55 You nod.

02:36:02 Patriot Constantine Stone exclaims, "Alright!"

02:36:03 Patriot Constantine Stone waves.

02:37:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm fine with that as well."

02:37:39 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hopefully this can be the last for a while."

02:37:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok you have to do what you have to."

02:37:47 You nod.

02:38:38 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hoepfully the results coming out at the same time as the broadcast will help."

02:38:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes."

02:38:55 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Since it shows that that we're not as divided as the press makes us out to be."

02:39:09 You say, "I really hope so."

02:39:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh most definitely not."

02:39:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The newer pilots, well you can't blame them and they're not altogether aware of all of the history."

02:39:50 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:39:51 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hopefully the silence is a good thing. No instant retaliation headlines. Maybe they're gettingg swarmed by officials and whatnot."

02:40:00 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Yeah, I don't blame the newer folks."

02:40:19 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Really impressed with that tone guy though, joined in while he was still a cadet? Go that guy."

02:40:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The guy's who's name I don't remember."

02:40:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They should be but when you've got your nose stuck in boks and your head jambed in a flight simulator and all of the other training, there's little time to pay attention to politics."

02:40:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Books."

02:40:38 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:40:38 You nod.

02:40:44 You say, "For sure."

02:40:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "For two years. That is a big chunk of time."

02:41:06 You say, "I was not involved much in politics when I was first starting out."

02:41:24 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Either way, none of us signed up to do protests and strikes. I don't blame them at all for not wanting to do it. Hell they still have loans to pay off probably."

02:41:33 You nod.

02:41:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh e either I spent as much time as I could pouring over notes that my isntructors had about so much and stuff that went way back."

02:41:47 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to you. "Neither was I, this has all been a crash course on it for me."

02:41:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:42:37 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well, I'm going to go to the new Earth lounge for a bit I think, hopefully it will be good."

02:42:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

02:42:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:42:45 You grin at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:42:52 You say to Eli, "Good job again."

02:42:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Yeah I think we should head that way too?"

02:43:01 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Thanks! I really do appreciate hearing that."

02:43:23 Lily says to Eli, "You really get your issues right too."

02:43:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins. "Except for when I make gooberish mistakes I guess."

02:43:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I ponder,  probably way too long, about what to say."

02:43:52 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

02:43:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh it's a very pressured time. I know you were heard and you made the right points."

02:44:11 You nod and grin.

02:44:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "We should have brought felo pets with us, so the kiddos could have something to look at."

02:44:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

02:44:38 You laugh.

02:45:44 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:45:44 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:45:46 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:45:46 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, a robotic chef named Nellie, an insulated black cooler, a small red insulated cooler, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

02:45:47 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:45:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:45:54 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:45:57 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:46:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:46:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:46:10 The computer reports that the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" has jumped out of the sector.

02:46:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:46:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:46:17 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:46:18 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:46:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:46:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:46:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:46:24 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:46:25 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:46:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:46:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:46:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:46:30 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:46:34 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"
The computer reports that the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" has landed on the planet New Earth.

02:46:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:46:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:46:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:46:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Constantine, Dakhal, you guys alright?"

02:46:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, why?"

02:47:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just making sure."

02:47:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:47:12 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:47:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:47:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:47:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:47:31 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:47:32 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:47:32 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:47:32 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:47:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-s

02:47:43 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

02:47:43 You exit the ship.

02:47:44 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The two-person light transport "Rhino" and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

02:47:46 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

02:47:46 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey is sitting on a slim and fashionable couch.
You can go out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

02:47:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

02:47:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a slim and fashionable couch.

02:47:55 You sit down on a slim and fashionable couch.

02:48:03 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:48:10 You say to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey, "Hey, long time no see!"

02:48:20 "Oh hey! It's you guys!" Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

02:48:27 Lily says to Eli, "Have I seen you on the Holovid! Wow you must be famous!"

02:48:30 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

02:48:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

02:48:33 You laugh.

02:48:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:48:35 You grin.

02:49:06 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Semi-AFK for a minute."

02:49:09 Lily says to Eli, "I always wanted to meet our super rockstar but wow a holovid famer!"

02:49:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

02:49:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

02:49:42 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey exclaims, "Yeah, I'm a public access star!"

02:49:45 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey exclaims, "Woo!"

02:49:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives Rogue Pilot Eli Grey a high five.

02:50:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a hot cup of espresso.

02:50:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "We were kidnapped to be used as political hostages. The Constantine you just heard was a very convincing imitation."

02:51:35 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:51:40 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

02:51:49 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Debate.

02:51:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident turns on her metallic gold touch einrophone and taps at it briefly.

02:53:35 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:53:35 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

02:53:47 Logged out of FTL Message Board Net.

02:53:59 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey switches a toggle on his metallic silver touch einrophone.

02:54:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Hiya."

02:54:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yo Tara."

02:54:47 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

02:54:48 Lily says to Eli, "The vote!"

02:54:52 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey exclaims, "Oh! Nice!"

02:54:54 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person light transport "Rhino" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

02:54:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "How's it going?"

02:54:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores yawns.

02:54:57 You grin.
Lily says to Eli, "It's on the Debate board."

02:55:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:55:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sounds like someone needs some coffee or something."

02:55:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "I'm wondering if we should do one saying that we want to keep Lambeth?"

02:56:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

02:56:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We should."

02:56:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It can be too late for coffee?"

02:56:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It feels like they don't care about any of the results, but at least there will be a record."

02:56:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Its almost 1:00!"

02:56:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Absolutely."

02:56:34 You nod.

02:56:36 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his peculiar milky-blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:56:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We also need to do one that says we would like to keep lambeth, not sure how it should be worded though."

02:56:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Still not too late for me."

02:56:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You know they're not goint to acknowledge us outwardly but we are making a difference."

02:56:50 You nod.

02:57:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "Yeah."

02:57:35 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:57:36 A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.

02:57:40 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

02:57:52 You nod.

02:58:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We shall continue to until this is resolved. That Outccord is smashed into bits, that Lambeth staysthat the QSA is restored and that you and Ather are granted your full privileges again."

02:58:21 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

03:30:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:30:52 You say, "It will require 2500 industry and 1000 combat."

03:30:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Oh well that's something we're not the best at is grid management but still, it's very nice!"

03:31:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "No launcher in there?"

03:31:16 You say, "Oh, one launcher."

03:31:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Nice too!"

03:31:37 You nod.

03:32:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I'm sure I'll get to see it in time. I'm happy for him and a bit amused at the same time."

03:32:35 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

03:32:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sure they want us to be jealous."

03:32:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:32:58 You say, "Heh, I'm not jealous."

03:33:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just don't fly that way."

03:33:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

03:33:16 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:33:34 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the two-person cipactli "Rainstorm".

03:33:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Makes one wonder if they ever had something like that before the war?"

03:33:56 You say, "But it's supposed to come out after the Accord withdrawl is complete."

03:34:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I see."

03:34:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I bet it will anyway."

03:34:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:34:23 You say, "I think it's basically like the heavy fighter, but with a ftl drive."

03:34:33 You say, "And the laser bonus."

03:34:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah right."

03:34:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have one. I'll check it out um when I'm dressed."

03:34:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:35:39 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder. "Oh maybe. I don't rememver now."

03:35:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah i'd have to get out the book but I'll check later."

03:36:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh we'll have to see if he wants to put a plant on there."

03:36:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident giggles.

03:36:19 You grin.

03:36:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

03:37:31 You say, "The heavy fighter is nice. I had one for quite a while. I prefer the hyperion fighters though."

03:37:38 There is minimal processing lag at the moment.

03:42:12 You say, "Yeah, that was cool."

03:43:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps it was just coincidental that he couldn't be available before. It just sort of gave the impression that he was avoiding but now it is apparent that he wasn't doing so deliberately."

03:44:19 You say, "Yeah, he wasn't. He kept trying to make it to them, but just couldn't. And actually, he was there for the transport brodcast with all of us."

03:44:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh I didn't know that so I'm glad to hear."

03:46:39 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:55:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

03:56:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I guess this is why I enjoy piloting as we don't have a dress code except that you must wear something on the bottom!"

03:56:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident giggles at you.

03:58:32 You say, "And actually, technically it's only wearing something to cover the private areas on the bottom. You could walk around in paties and not get arrested."

03:58:38 You say, "Panties."

03:59:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep."

03:59:11 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

04:00:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

04:00:34 You say, "However, I don't think it'd be appropriate for the SDC to walk around in boxers."

04:00:34 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

04:00:53 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Sup?"

04:01:02 [General Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Mining!"

04:01:03 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:02:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh well she already acts like one and a back roads tramp besides."

04:02:31 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "This is true."

04:02:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh I have general on not sure if you do."

04:02:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

04:02:42 You say, "I do."

04:02:44 You grin.

04:02:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh wow, you folks are already back? You made some good time."

04:02:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

04:02:54 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Perhaps you remind him of such."

04:03:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:03:07 You laugh.

04:03:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hey Eli? What did you say about mining yesterday?"

04:03:37 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I do not look like a schoolgirl."

04:04:27 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Oh... Thanks for that, I think?"

04:04:32 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "*laughing* wishful thinking?"

04:04:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know, that it's glorious?"

04:05:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey hey, it's the Evangeline."

04:05:15 Lily says to you, "Well if its our private beacons you can Love if that makes you happy."

04:05:20 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "How's it going Rogue?"

04:05:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

04:05:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

04:06:02 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I do."

04:06:04 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."

04:06:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately. "Honey, I don't want to make you do something you're not completely comfortable with."

04:06:04 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

04:06:08 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "How's things Eli? Nice work with the merchants."

04:06:26 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You indeed did."

04:06:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll tell you so if i'm not."

04:07:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:07:56 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nobody has communicated so yeah."

04:07:58 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Work what and why and how? With who."

04:08:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You forgot where."

04:08:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The thing bout station parts."

04:08:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh eva is such an airhead she won't even have a clue."

04:08:21 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Oh I wasn't told anything Lily."

04:08:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:08:30 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not surprised!"

04:08:31 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I would have expected a letter or something."

04:09:06 You ask, "Y|eah Eva. Served to you on a sliver platter?"

04:09:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "You didn't send a letter no?"

04:09:21 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Sounds like y'all have some org issues."

04:09:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Do we have any intents of clearing the Frontier Cluster this period?"

04:09:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:09:30 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ahem well Evangeline, you need to decide id Starseekers will continue to participate to provide power plants on Temorary Stations at least."

04:09:36 You ask, "I mean, yeah Eva. Served to you on a silver platter?"

04:09:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Seriously."

04:09:43 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "More than some, honestly."

04:09:45 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Nobody has advised me on that."

04:09:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why I asked ya to write her some time ago Lily."

04:10:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'd rather the strikers not, since it's not something that's immediately necessary. But if you want to try and get some non Union folks to do it that would be fine."

04:10:05 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yes, we can still provide core things on stations, yes."

04:10:05 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I think y'all need to sort that out as a collective group."

04:10:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:10:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No."

04:10:21 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Thank you for telling me in a virtual letter. I'll be sure to do that right away."

04:10:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:10:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That is work."

04:10:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I know it seems like the vents are a problem, but clearing them only gets us temproary access, it doesn't actually prevent bari spreading or anything."

04:11:17 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Let me ask you this. Are you all still doing the strike thing?"

04:11:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The only thing that's gonna clear that station for good, is a plasma flood, which is very expesnive and involves evactuating the station."

04:11:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That's comparable to saying that the RATS in space are only temporarily out of the way, and we shouldn't worry about them due to that."

04:11:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "But I'll respect your decision."

04:11:54 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yup."

04:11:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:11:55 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We are but sEAS at least will continue to support temporary stations. After all, we're paid in eAOS not aEU."

04:12:15 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That wasn't really the point Lily."

04:12:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:12:20 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "At least in terms of Organization's income not personal income."

04:13:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:13:01 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Erik this does not concern you directly."

04:13:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can see why you would see it that way, but this comes from professionals. The station was dealing with the bari issue for a very long time without even the ability for us to clean the vents. During that time we were assured that they were preventing the bari from spreading."

04:13:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm just pointing it out because it seems you missed a memo."

04:13:14 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, y'all all need to decide if ya want your government benefittin from these stations. If so, then contribute normally. If not, then don't. But Seas needs to sit down with Seekers bout it...and it's somethin I ain't got no part in no more."

04:13:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So shut the fuck up idiot."

04:13:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He really irrittes me."

04:13:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Irrittes."

04:13:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh."

04:13:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Irritates."

04:13:55 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Lily we can still provide parts, but as it stands, the strike is still active."

04:14:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:14:11 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I shwll setle this with Melinda and thank you all for your input."

04:14:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:14:20 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wow rather shall."

04:14:45 You say, "It's ok. You're not the first AEU person to get irritated at him."

04:14:52 [General Communication] Sighing into her communicator, Evangeline cuts off the communicator with a click.

04:14:56 You say, "I think Tara about hates his guts."

04:14:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That doesn't convince me that it's still not a concern. The Bari are a threat no matter how "in control" they are, just as a legion of RATS is a threat as it approaches our belts to reduce them to dust."

04:14:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:14:59 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As for what Starseekers will do, I can't answr for them."

04:15:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I just said."

04:15:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "We will still provide parts, but there is still a strike in effect."

04:15:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah he is a jerk as is warbutt."

04:15:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:15:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lily, y'all and Seekers need to sit down and make a decision. I'm just tryin to get y'all together 'cause I ain't the middle-man no more's all."

04:15:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh I agree that bari in general are a very real threat."

04:15:52 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I wake up to drama as usual."

04:16:02 [General Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Only becuase people love to make it."

04:16:06 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Woo, first boobs, then I heard the word fuck. Oh my poor the puzzlingly feminine form of cadet ears, *chuckling*."

04:16:06 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Angel."

04:16:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:16:22 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Right Morris so as I say I will settle this with Mel and that's the only person I care to discuss it with and she already knows what we're willing to contribute."

04:16:25 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Hello shule. How are you?"

04:16:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mel ain't in the AEU."

04:16:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not at all saying that we shouldn't worry about bari, or RATs, I'm just going off of what the specialist on Frontier cluster told us in letters years ago."

04:16:36 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "The f... ser... Do you not listen?"

04:16:47 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Mel also isn't in seekers."

04:16:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wish I could remember that guy's name. I bet Ather remembers."

04:17:00 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm doing alright, Angel. How are you?"

04:17:03 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm the only trustee who is active at the moment."

04:17:04 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Mel's not in many orgs."

04:17:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:17:15 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Look, if y'all want to continue buying parts go for it. It's no skin off my nose. The disagreeing will end that way."

04:17:17 [General Communication] Angel Martin giggles at Emily Ford.

04:17:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:17:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well it's work Eli and I am not doing work for now and for probably a long long time."

04:17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hopefully not much longer."

04:17:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:17:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It does pay out in income."

04:18:05 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

04:18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright, so... Here's the scoop. We will buy parts, but only after the strike ends. I don't wnat to contribute to something that the government can get a hold of, Ok? Does that work for you ma'am?"

04:18:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No but you can do what you wish. The government can't get ahold of anything that is aboard other ships."

04:19:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:19:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Our refusing to contribute only creates issues with relationships with other alliances."

04:19:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You could just try calling for a crew to clear the vents, whoever is interested in that. I feel like I woke up and heard half a conversation."

04:19:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:19:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But if Kim told you to do this, then fine."

04:19:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Some people don't mind doing it."

04:19:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Kim didn't say a damn word, Lily."

04:20:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Gah jus gfor fucks sakes this is her reason and how lame is that."

04:20:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I was thrown into this today like I was thrown into everything else. Kim didn't say one word. I'm the only trustee who is here now. I rule till she decides to show. If you really want, you can write her a letter. I don't care."

04:20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not necessarily, they seem perfectly fine with goign without AEU parts for now. I leave that up to temp station folks though. I've just been concentrating on getting the pilots to join, not whole orgs."

04:21:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I'm perfectly fine with the vents beign cleared, I just don' tthink any of the strikers should do it."

04:21:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:21:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's fine Evangeline. SEAS will contribute power plants to keep up a good faith effort to support others then. We qualify for them so we'll be more than happy to contribute to the benefit of other humanity."

04:22:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm not going to clear any vent till the strike is over. Hell I'm not doing any work till it is over, so please, if you want to do what you want, then that's fine. Me? I'm staying out of this bullshit. As for the parts, write Kim or do what I suggested and stay out of it for now. I don't think the other alliances organizations, rather, give a fuck what we do as long as we are still on strike."

04:22:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There haha hope I put that snippy bitch in her place."

04:22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Do what you want Lily. I'm working alone at the moment. When Kim comes around, I'll talk to her."

04:22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Wowzers, okay."

04:23:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not telling anyone they have to clean the vents."

04:23:05 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.

04:23:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, I mean and contributing to stations that don't make money shouldn't even be a question. I think it's only credit making stations are in question at this point."

04:23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was just saying, it sounded like somebody wanted to, and you can probably get three non AEU pilots to hepl."

04:23:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:23:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I refuse to lead a crew at this time. If you all do so, it's up to you but I won't."

04:23:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yes, we can contribute to stations that don't make money, but nothing else. That sounds fair enough, but I need a solid basis."

04:24:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:24:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I contribute millions to stations which earn little or no money but money, althugh I know how to earn it very well, doesn't control why I choose to help others."

04:25:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What it sounds like to me is that Starseekers is going to do what they want and SEAS is not necessarily going to do the same thing. Let's just agree to disagree. We have the right to choose what each of our respective orgs will or will not do."

04:25:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh no shit shule i'm jsut so fed-up with starseekers."

04:26:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Especially that there is such an airhead in charge right now."

04:26:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I don't... That wasn't the point. But whatever."

04:26:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Letter written and sent to Melinda."

04:26:42 You say, "I know. I'm just saying let's drop it. No sense in giving the news and therefore the government more fammunition to show how we are not united."

04:26:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "And you don't need to remove vasalization, you just need to spend money on your own parts Lily."

04:27:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh they already know that in respect to starseekers and sEAS."

04:27:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's just a tolerance thing and it may end."

04:27:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I can withdraw our vassalizaiton right now."

04:27:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It is so tempting."

04:28:11 You say, "I'm know. I'm just saying that right now, arguing over the alliance channel just gives the government more ammunition to use against us pilots."

04:28:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Duly noted Eva."

04:28:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because then Melinda would depend onus and we'd have the upper hand. They would have to vassalizaiton with us if they wanted on stations."

04:28:40 You hear Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's metallic gold touch einrophone ringing.

04:28:41 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Thanks Mel."

Subject: AEU orgs and stations. Especially builders, please read.
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 02:42 30 August 2317 GST
--
Until further notice from the orgs, Starseekers will not be participating in any station that generates income. They will contribute to any station that does not generate income such as the bubble.

However, Seas is willing to go ahead and purchase the batteries for any and all income generating stations.

I have not yet received word from Invaders.

Please respect the choices of the orgs and take care to get the correct batteries when you are building stations.

Thanks,
Melinda

09:49:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

09:49:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

09:49:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

09:49:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

09:49:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

09:49:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

09:49:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

09:49:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

09:49:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

09:49:49 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

10:25:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, ok."

10:25:58 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

10:25:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

10:26:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

10:26:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

10:26:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:26:11 The ship is already moving.

10:26:13 The ship is already moving.

10:27:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

10:27:22 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

10:27:23 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Should anyone need them, I have checked and made sure there are a good number of batteries, reactors and so on Starseekers Spare parts."

10:27:27 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

10:27:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

10:27:33 You peer out...

[Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four]
This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. One of the EMMs is emitting a steady hum, indicating that it should be replaced. A ramp leads up to the rest of the station.

10:27:56 I don't see that here.

10:28:04 Kim Saunders strides in from above.

10:28:06 You smile at Kim Saunders.

10:28:07 Some lights on the scout "White Eagle" flash as Kim Saunders boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

10:28:10 Kim Saunders exits from the scout "White Eagle".

10:28:14 I don't understand that.

10:28:14 Kim Saunders waves to you.

10:28:17 You hug Kim Saunders.

10:28:17 Kim Saunders exclaims, "Hi there!"

10:28:21 Kim Saunders hugs you.

10:28:23 You say to Kim, "Hi!"

10:28:29 You say to Kim, "Look!"

10:28:33 You gesture vaguely at the two-person flare "Deadly Strike".

10:28:37 You beam.

10:28:54 Kim Saunders exclaims, "Nice!"

10:28:58 You grin.

10:29:12 Kim Saunders asks, "Did you recently apply for that?"

10:29:23 You say, "I've been applying for like over a year."

10:29:30 You say, "Over and over."

10:29:32 Kim Saunders exclaims, "Ah, and there it is, cool!"

10:29:35 You chuckle.

10:29:36 You grin.

10:30:04 Kim Saunders says, "I have heard about these, of course, but never used one. Don't know much about it. But I bet it is a nice ship."

10:30:12 You exclaim, "It's amazing!"

10:30:27 You say, "35 perent laser bonus. The thing hits harder than the clipper."

10:30:31 You say, "Percent."

10:30:49 Kim Saunders says, "Wow, yeah that does sound powerful."

10:31:19 Kim Saunders says, "And with weapons in 2 rooms, it is probable more manageable than the clipper in terms of grid."

10:31:26 You say, "It really is."

10:32:07 Kim Saunders says, "Well, in a few weeks I should be back to full steam, maybe I should apply to one too at some point."

10:32:11 You say, "One of these days, we'll have to do a beacon in it."

10:32:18 Kim Saunders exclaims, "That'll be fun!"

10:32:20 You say, "I'll take you on a beacon and good."

10:32:30 You grin at Kim Saunders. "You should apply for one. Everyone should."

10:33:14 Kim Saunders giggles.

10:33:16 You say, "I miss seeing you around."

10:33:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thank you Kim."

10:34:01 Kim Saunders says, "I know, I've missed being around too. Although probably I have not missed much of the political climate things. Still a bunch to catch up on."

10:34:16 You say, "Yeah, the political climbate isn't the best for sure."

10:34:17 You glance around at your surroundings.

10:34:37 Kim nods solumnly.

10:34:52 You say, "Ok, I'll get out of your hair. I just wanted to show you that."

10:35:02 "Nice, thanks!" Kim Saunders smiles.

12:26:31 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

12:26:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.

14:58:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:58:17 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:58:18 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

14:58:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

14:58:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:58:22 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

14:58:22 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.

Star Conquest Help: Siege the Card Game
--
Two militarized outposts stand at opposite ends of a sector cluster. Each one launches a tremendous fleet and goes forth to conquer. Which side will defeat the other fleet and besiege the enemy outpost? Will the outpost then repel the siege and manage to win the day, or will they be defeated? The object of Siege is to find out.

Siege is played with a deck of cards, each card representing a participant in the battle. Close range combatants, ranged combatants, tech users, siege weapons, and various defenses are all represented. Each card has a specific ability to attack, and also to defend against each kind of combatant. In play, these abilities are used in a random roll of the dice to determine which card wins the battle.

The game follows a specific sequence. First, each player draws 20 cards each, and each player chooses 5 cards to defend his or her outpost. These cards cannot be taken out again except at great expense. The first player then chooses a card from his or her army to attack, and the second player chooses a card to defend. Whoever wins this battle takes the next turn.

The game follows these basic rules for battles:

* Close range combatants (Outsiders) are effective against tech users.
* Ranged combatants (IFS) are effective against close range combatants.
* Tech users (Jinu) are effective against ranged combatants.

Siege cards are useful for attacking 
15:30:55 outposts because no one defends against them well, but they can't be used in the open battle portion of the game.

Armor cards defend equally well against every sort of attack, but can't be used to initiate battle.

Cards in the outpost can be taken out and played against the attacking fleet, but this card will be at half effectiveness, and will also never again be available to defend the outpost, even if it wins.

Once one fleet is defeated, the remaining fleet is besieging the enemy outpost. If all of the cards in the outpost are defeated, then the defender loses. If, on the other hand, the defenders in the outpost are successful in defeating the besieging fleet, then the defender wins.

Defenders in an outpost get a bonus to all of their defense rolls.

Commands:

16:01:42 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Three poseidons, artemises, ares, etc."

16:01:42 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:01:44 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:01:46 [Tactical Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Coming as fast as I can. Can't say how long it will take me, I'm probably ten sectors out."

16:01:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:01:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:01:54 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Landin back on Earth."

16:01:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:02:02 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "On my way."

16:02:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:02:19 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:02:22 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Anka" has jumped into the sector.

16:02:22 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

16:02:23 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Would be nice if we can get the crew."

16:02:25 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Hello there, Anka! Welcome to home space!"

16:03:44 Morris Corlew says, "Tobias'll be nuff for a pincer."

16:03:45 Ali Candan takes Morris Corlew into his group.

16:03:49 Emily Ford says, "I had to come back for reps with a solo altercation against a stupid Ares yesterday."

16:03:55 Morris Corlew grins.

16:04:07 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

16:04:13 Katina Faye orders a warm sugar cookie.

16:04:16 Emily Ford says, "I don't have enough tools to engineer, so I'll grab a gunning station today."

16:04:17 Ali Candan says, "I'd rather take an undercrewed cruiser out than a pincer with all hte poseidon."

16:04:17 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm sugar cookie.

16:04:28 Morris Corlew nods to Ali Candan.

16:04:32 You nod to Ali Candan.

16:04:44 Emily Ford says, "Shouldn't be too bad, I'd suggest trying to fill rooms one, two, five and six."

16:04:46 Morris Corlew says, "If Hakeem can get here we'll only be one short."

16:04:51 Ali Candan speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

16:04:51 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Anyone else on their way?"

16:04:55 Morris Corlew asks, "Why the chain only rooms?"

16:05:11 [Tactical Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "As fast as I can, sort of slow ship here and I was about ten sectors out."

16:05:12 Emily says to Morris, "More turrets that fire faster, assuming you have the two second chainguns."

16:05:37 Morris says to Emily, "Generally we fire heavies at IFS so if we have to undercrew we've left one and/or two open."

16:05:40 Katina Faye says to Morris, "Did you see how many posidons?"

16:05:45 Morris says to Katina Faye, "Three."

16:05:50 Emily Ford nods.

16:05:55 Ali Candan speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

16:05:56 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hakeem?"

16:06:09 Emily Ford says, "Johann is camped out at Crias, I guess he's not interested."

16:06:13 Katina Faye asks, "Maybe he has it off?"

16:06:23 Morris Corlew says, "He ain't on comms."

16:06:24 Ali Candan says, "Johann's not on comms."

16:06:44 Emily Ford says, "Oh, interesting. He hasn't long headed over there."

16:07:00 Morris Corlew says, "Somebody's round but with their comm off. Could be him."

16:07:04 Ali Candan says, "Right. Let me support my own cruiser in case we blow up."

16:07:07 A group a table over have a conversation about pilots from other alliances while rolling their eyes and shaking their heads.

16:07:11 Ali Candan disbands his group.

16:07:12 Ali Candan strides out.

16:07:19 Emily Ford says, "Hakeem did say he didn't have time for beacons after we last headed to Dusty, so I'd think he'll not be available."

16:07:23 Morris Corlew nods.

16:07:23 Katina Faye asks, "Guys ask on general?"

16:07:40 Emily Ford speaks into her purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:07:41 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Anyone available to crew against an IFS siege?"

16:07:46 Emily Ford says, "Yes."

16:07:46 [Tactical Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Inbound to Earth."

17:34:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

18:01:36 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

18:01:36 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.

18:48:46 You ask, "So what is the beautiful Angel up to?"

18:49:01 Over the line, you hear Angel Martin ask, "Nothing much. Laying in my sunroom. How about you?"

18:49:44 You say, "Not a whole lot. Just talking to merchant ships when they're flying around. Other than that. Staying lazy."

18:49:52 Over the line, Angel Martin laughs.

18:49:58 Over the line, you hear Angel Martin say, "Best plan we've ever had."

18:50:06 You exclaim, "I agree!"

18:50:39 You exclaim, "And you have a sun room? I'm jealous!"

18:51:37 Over the line, you hear Angel Martin say, "Yeah. I live with klaus on old earth. There's a sunroom in our apartment, because we live at the top of the towers."

18:51:57 You exclaim, "Ah, ok. Very cool!"

18:52:26 You say, "Heck, I don't even think I know how to get to the Towers. I've never been there."

18:53:09 Over the line, Angel Martin giggles.

18:53:13 Over the line, you hear Angel Martin say, "They're on broadway."

19:07:48 [General Communication] Jacob Shields laughs.

19:08:38 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Coffee is pretty damn good, but I've only had a small bite to eat from one of those little ration boxes. Can't say I'm all that impressed with the taste of whatever they put in those bricks."

19:09:06 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "First, get real food, not those crappy rations."

19:10:24 You exclaim, "I'm so glad you believe me!"

19:10:44 Over the line, Angel Martin laughs.

19:10:48 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Hey, at least they don't break the bank. I need to find a crew for missions or a few asteroid hauls later on. Also need to get a kit for hauling as well. But then, I also have more pressing things to worry about. Soooooo, yeah. I think missions may be my go-to thing right now. Shame I can't yet get a battlesuit."

19:11:03 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sure you can."

19:12:16 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Well, I'd rather not take out a loan right now. I still have the one I got from flight school to pay off. I don't need to put myself in any more debt."

19:12:25 You say, "And no, I won't make any promises that I'm not trying to get you on a date."

19:12:32 You say, "I mean. Oops."

19:12:40 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Don't worry, it'll be trivially easy to pay it back once you get on your feet."

19:12:40 You ask, "Did I say that out loud?"

19:12:47 Over the line, Angel Martin laughs.

19:12:51 Over the line, you hear Angel Martin say, "You're terrible."

19:13:29 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I know. That's the hard part though. Getting on my feet, that is. I'm still trying to stand up and all that goodness, if you catch my drift."

19:15:03 You laugh.

19:16:11 Over the line, Angel Martin giggles.

19:18:55 You say, "Yeah, probably too terrible for you."

19:19:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Dang, I was too late to tell Jacob to go get some awesome telexan coffee."

19:19:53 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's everyone up to?"

19:19:58 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Nests."

19:20:11 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Station flight control here, we detect an AEU shuttle inbound."

19:20:32 You laugh.

19:22:47 You laugh.

19:23:19 You say, "Well, you're certainly as pretty as one."

19:23:48 Over the line, you hear Angel Martin say, "Aww... thank you."

19:24:27 You say, "You are most definitely welcome."

19:26:07 You say, "But seriously, I'd be happy to show you a flare."

19:40:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:40:51 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:40:52 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

19:40:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:40:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:40:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:40:56 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:40:57 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

19:40:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

19:40:59 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

19:41:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:41:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:41:44 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

19:41:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

19:41:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

19:41:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:42:00 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:42:00 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:42:02 You hold Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's hand, taking her into your group.

19:42:04 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

20:42:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Unfourtantly I imagine those simulators require a great deal of power to run, considering what they do, and on a ship, it'd need to use the ships charge.."

20:42:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "By the way Tara? Did anyone mention to you that you should submit your planet finds yourself? I thought they were all submitted together when I went on a trip so I didn't do mine for quite some time after I got back."

20:42:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "The one on AFW command might be a great deal more advanced then the ones you had during your lessons, Jacob."

20:43:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "It's odd, because before I came here I used to be a musician. Gave quite a few performances when I lived on telex. Wish I could pick it back up at some point as a hobby."

20:43:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Im probably about to go do some artifact hunting, but im debating battle of mir or 777."

20:44:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "You probably could, theres a store that sells instruments accessable to pilots. I own a guitar. Maybe you could teach me sometime!"

20:44:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, there's a music store."

20:44:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Tara."

20:44:38 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Beacons?"

20:44:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Though the prices might suprise you, though its not suprisng. Most places that sell stuff to pilots sell stuff for a lot more. A million credits for a guitar."

20:44:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Sorry! Hi Shule."

20:44:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I specialized in piano, harp and cello, plus a little singing on the side."

20:45:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And ouch. That's a bit more than I thought a guitar would cost."

20:45:21 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Sure."

20:45:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Well, in the grand scheme its not much for pilots."

20:46:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Might take getting used to, I've only been a pilot for a little over a month and own enough assets to be worth over four hundred million."

20:46:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, that's true. I'll have to look at getting a few instruments when I have more cash and all that stuff. I'm a little rusty though."

20:47:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "But no jet as of yet."

20:47:07 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.

20:47:17 You scramble to your feet.

20:47:17 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]
You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, Prissy the big violet long-haired felo, and Shine the big white glowing felo here.

20:47:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Tara, did you hear that Dusty Reaches was held under siege?"

20:48:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "What? When. I didn't. Was it the IFS?"

20:48:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Want to take a shot at asteroid hauling?"

20:49:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, it was. The Accord fought valiantly beside us, but there were a good number of IFS ships. I truly hope it's not an indication of things to come."

20:49:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd be down for that, sure. I'll have to get some supplies though I think. Unless you recommend I just get a cannon?"

20:49:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Just get the cannon."

20:49:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just remember, when you point the cannon at the asteroid, you have to say "You messed with the wrong pilot this time..." before you fire."

20:49:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, just the cannon."

20:50:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores laughs.

20:50:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Shooting up roids is the way to go now."

20:50:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "And don't fall in craters."

20:50:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, ".. Especially without a jet."

20:50:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

20:50:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Don't hesitate to take a loan out for the cannon, either. You'll make the money back quick enough. You'll also get to experience the rift if you haven't!"

20:51:16 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

20:51:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Alrighty. I can do that. Where should we meet?"

20:51:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Woo! The infamous rift!"

20:51:46 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.

20:52:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That transport one of you guys? The one that just jumped into New Earth?"

20:52:09 You switch a flight control scanner on.

20:52:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "From glittering Belt?"

20:52:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "That's me."

20:52:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok, good deal. I thought I was goign to have to get up."

20:52:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, Rhino is always me."

20:52:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And here I am in my little flitter..."

20:53:03 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth Orbit flight control, this is New Earth, AEU transport incoming."

20:53:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It just says AEU Transport on the scanner."

20:53:24 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth flight control here, AEU flitter on an incoming trajectory.  Clear the pad."

20:53:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I may need to get a scanner at some point."

20:53:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Boy, if we had flight control scanners sophisticated enough to tell us who it was, that would be pretty useful."

20:54:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That would be cool."

21:01:24 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
21:01:24 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, a robotic chef named Nellie, an insulated black cooler, a small red insulated cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

21:01:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:01:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:01:34 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:01:39 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Hyperion here, an AEU transport is outbound."

21:01:39 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

21:23:58 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:23:58 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

21:50:51 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

21:50:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:50:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:50:54 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:50:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:50:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:51:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:51:11 Which sector did you mean?

21:51:12

Enter your selection:

21:51:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:51:13 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:51:14 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

21:51:14 The starship is already moving.

21:51:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:51:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:51:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:51:21 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: qr/}m0>Xfgo$Pz%[|3EB]OzcInf<q7n>5,xS#`6g
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

21:51:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:51:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:51:26 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:51:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'll go check it out."

21:51:30 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Bikura, we detect a League transport inbound."

21:51:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:51:31 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:51:32 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:52:00 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:52:01 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:00:53 Via general sector communication, League Stealth Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Welcome to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. There is currently no watchtower and recharge station, though it will be back soon. Your way home is 286. Happy Hauling."

22:01:00 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Repairing Battery-Powered Long-Range Watchtower.

22:01:02 There are no other ships in the sector.

22:01:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:01:17 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

22:01:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Never mind. Sector clear."

22:01:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:01:36 You begin the docking sequence.

22:01:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "They jumped out on your arrival?"

22:01:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

22:01:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

22:01:48 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

22:01:51 You lift a small plastic cover and press a green button.

22:01:51 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.

22:01:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:01:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Figures."

22:02:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Guess they didn't want to dance with a flare."

22:02:22 You peer out...

22:02:23 
[League Repairing Battery-Powered Long-Range Watchtower; Docking Bay]
A small, basic docking bay is the core of the station, along with the life support system and resource storage. Small hatches lead to the other station modules.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is parked here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

22:02:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Hauler didn't take any serious damage. They're sturdy ships. Three shots and didn't even go over four percent average damage."

22:02:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nice."

22:03:01 A launch trajectory is located.

22:03:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:03:08 There are no other ships in the sector.

22:03:10 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

22:03:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:03:19 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

22:03:20 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

22:03:30 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

22:03:30 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:03:31 The starship has left a unique area of space.

22:03:40 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

22:04:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Woo! Horse and buggy riftscape."

22:12:33 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

22:12:33 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

22:12:36 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Autonav Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

22:13:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:13:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:13:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:37:35 
[Telex-Providence Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Newly constructed, this spaceport landing pad is among the largest and most technologically advanced in any alliance. The seemingly endless expanse of smooth pavement is nevertheless dwarfed by an absolutely massive tree trunk that towers hundreds of meters above the pad and the surrounding forest. The trunk is broken off near the top, and the jagged edges remain, though they are crowned by a huge glass dome. A large archway has been carved into the base of the trunk, and through the crystalline sliding doors you can make out a palatially scaled spaceport concourse thronged with pilots, travellers, and civilian employees. A large number of ships are scattered across the pad, with a variety of hoses, machines, and droids attached to them. Every few minutes, the thunderous sound of a ship's atmospheric thrusters obliterates any other sounds in the area.
The two-person light transport "Treasure Box", the vostok-class capsule "A Very Long Name For A Very Little Ship", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You can go nowhere.

22:59:42 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:59:42 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

23:03:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:03:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:03:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:03:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:03:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

23:13:18 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What was this very loaded wording, pray tell?"

23:13:34 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

23:14:12 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]

23:14:13 This office is small but elegant, the recessed lighting shining softly over pale green carpet, silvery white walls, and a modestly sized modern steel desk with an ergonomically designed mesh and leather chair behind it. Arranged in front of the desk are several other chairs, while ferns in white pots occupy the corners of the office, and on the walls are framed images of sleek AEU starships. The door is open.
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

23:14:14 You grab the door handle as you leave.

23:14:14 The door to the west suddenly closes.

23:16:11 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

23:25:46 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Non Serviam Redux". The organization has earned 541,714.66 credits.

23:26:07 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Who exactly are you refusing to serve?"

23:27:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Unbelievable."

23:27:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What?"

23:27:51 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They think the pilots were tricked into voting against Outccord?"

23:28:05 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh is that what they meant?"

23:28:05 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah sighs. "Apparently, somehow."

23:28:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I guess. Was it really loaded?"

23:28:11 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Wait, what? What is the wording they are referring to?"

23:28:20 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So yeah what did it say."

23:28:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't remember it word for word now, but I didn't think it was loaded. It was perhaps a bit longer than usual."

23:29:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wouldn't it have been easier to say, do you support outccord, yes or no?"

23:29:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's how our first vote was worded that was also unanimous, at the very start of this."

23:30:00 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yes, but if you can rig the question so that every answer supports it, then you look better in the media."

23:30:18 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I very much doubt that was the point."

23:30:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So why did you take a second vote, and why change the wordin for a second vote?"

23:30:54 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'm suspecting to get enough media spin to muddy the waters. But that's just an educated guess."

23:31:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Um no, that's not what we were trying to do, we weren't trying to do anything deceptive."

23:31:55 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Oh you guys ran a new vote. Ok I misread this apparently."

23:32:28 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok I withdraw my comment."

23:32:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So take another vote and just put it plain and simple. Do you, a pilot of the AEU civilian corps, support the AEU withdrawl from the Accord of Free Worlds...if ya want it to be all flowery and whatnot. But if ya throw things in bout what a bad idea it is and stuff, it's easily construed as bein a loaded question."

23:32:51 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just trying to reinforce that everyone's against it. Even the ones labeled as patriots, or people who are very new and not striking."

23:44:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

23:44:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow."

23:44:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I know, right?"

23:44:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The ISN didn't really interpret that the way I hoped."

23:44:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And Morris the know-it-all speaks again."

23:44:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, what did he say?"

23:45:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, apparently not. Maybe do another one that's just a one word question, "Outccord?" heh."

23:45:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, just how exactly we should have worded it."

23:45:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

23:46:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn't think the wording was loaded, I know that everyone knew what they were voting for."

23:46:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'll certainly do that if people want that."

23:47:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's interesting, I would have thought the ISN would have loved the anti-Best sentiment."

23:47:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Next time he complains about being the middle man, I'm going to tell him flat out, if he doesn't want to be the middle man, then there is a simple solution. Keep quiet and stay out of it!"

23:47:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know if it will make a difference, either way we should probably get oen tarted for trying to keep Lambeth, it might not be too late."

23:47:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Perhaps they're not really aligned against him?"

23:48:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I do know Lambeth to already have been fired."

23:48:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, ISN isn't for or against Best, they're for a good story."

23:48:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At least assuming what they tell me is true."

23:48:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which maybe there's no reason to assume."

23:48:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

23:48:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I probably shouldn't have sent that to them, then."

23:50:41 Not much to see out there.

23:50:44 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:50:44 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:50:46 You peer out...

23:50:47 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

23:50:49 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:51:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:51:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:51:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:51:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:51:23 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

23:55:14 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I'll write you an instruction manual for communicators lexy, so you would stop miscomming."

23:55:25 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Buttons are hard."

23:55:41 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "It won't help. I need one of those kiddy ones with the big buttons."

23:55:47 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Elephants are actually the big grey leathery things with tree-trunk sized legs, long tusks and a long trunk. The thing with the spots and super long neck is a giraffe."

23:58:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think maybe just asking if something like, "Do you believe the AEu should remain in the Accord" would be sufficient?"

23:59:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I can definitely do that, but we already have a resolution with almost that exact wording on record."
