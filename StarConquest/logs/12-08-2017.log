01:09 [Starship "William Dove"; Observation Deck]

01:09 You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, and a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing fuchsia and dark blue aquatic life and coral rocks here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:09 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]
You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, Mischief the large black felo, a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, and Cheri-Pye the old large light violet felo here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:09 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, a small red insulated cooler, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

01:09 You can't go that way.

01:09 You peer out...

01:09 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 956" and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

01:09 I don't see "lily" here.

01:09 I don't see "lily" here.

01:09 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small

04:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:18 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:18 You say, "Nope."

04:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:19 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:19 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:19 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:21 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:22 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the neck.

04:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair with Shine the sleeping big white glowing felo on it, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver cer

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

14:18 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go out.

The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

14:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:23 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

14:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:24 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:24 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

14:24 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

14:24 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:24 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:25 --

14:25 Dear Lily and Shule,
I have a gift for you for the Holidays since I doubt I will be around to give it to you at the proper time. It is sort of a combined gift, so one item is for Lily, and the other is for Shule. It isn't much, but I hope that you guys will find it to your liking. I'd appreciate it if you could open it until the holiday for sentimental reasons, however it is completely up to the both of you.
Happy Holidays,
Katina

14:26 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

14:26 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

14:28 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

14:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:28 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

22:15 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Lily Kaise.

22:15 Lily Kaise grins at you.

22:15 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

22:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:16 Lily says to you, "You have everything?"

22:16 You smile at Lily Kaise.

22:16 You nod to Lily Kaise.

22:16 Lily Kaise says, "Ok will go on over to old earth."

22:16 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Happy, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:16 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

22:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

22:17 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:17 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:17 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

22:17 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:17 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

22:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:17 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:17 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

22:17 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Happy! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

22:17 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

22:17 Lily Kaise trips over Shule Elemmire as she attempts to work with a nearby control panel.
(8 seconds roundtime.)

22:17 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

22:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:17 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:17 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 221" has jumped into the sector.

22:17 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 221! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

22:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:17 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Happy. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

22:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:18 You're already standing.

22:18 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

22:18 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:18 You join Lily Kaise's group.

22:18 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:18 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters after Lily Kaise.

22:18 You follow Lily Kaise out.
[Starship "Happy"; Airlock]

You can go out.
Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Lily Kaise.
Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

22:18 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the vostok-class capsule "Canned Heat".

22:18 Lily Kaise waves.

22:19 Elaine Moreau says, "It's a small army."

22:19 Wendy Arroyo waves.

22:19 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:19 Elaine Moreau says, "Take cover, we're under attack."

22:19 Nissi Valdaire nods to Wendy Arroyo.

22:19 Wendy says to Elaine, "A Fringie telling people to take cover?"

22:19 Elaine says to Wendy, "Yeah, so I can fight without worrying about friendly fire."

22:19 Wendy says to Elaine, "A Fringie worrying about friendly fire?"

22:20 You wave.

22:20 You say, "Hi everyone."

22:20 Nicolette Lawrence just arrived.

22:20 Elaine says to Wendy, "Too much paperwork."

22:20 Nicolette Lawrence sits down on a cushy booth seat.

22:20 Wendy says to Elaine, "I think the only thing you'd need to do so you're sut not to hit your friendlies is to aim for them."

22:20 Elaine Moreau squints at Wendy Arroyo.

22:20 Wendy Arroyo grins at Elaine Moreau.

22:21 Nissi Valdaire says, "Don't have to worry about friendly fire when minicannons have drained all your grid."

22:21 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

22:21 Wendy says to Nissi, "Battlesuit-mounted minicannons? I like the way you think."

22:21 Nissi Valdaire grins.

22:22 Elaine Moreau says, "Ew, minicannons."

22:22 Melinda Michaels says, "Who was that arguing over minis with us the other day."

22:22 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

22:22 Wendy Arroyo exclaims, "That was me!"

22:22 Melinda Michaels says, "Ah yes, mini fan."

22:22 You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.

22:22 Elaine Moreau says, "I think Lexie was a mini fan, too. But that was on our channel."

22:22 Melinda Michaels says, "Silly people."

22:22 Elaine Moreau says, "I want guided missiles. Get the boom where it needs to go."

22:23 Wendy Arroyo says, "I want a space ram."

22:23 A pilot at a nearby table excitedly describes a recent find in deep space.

22:23 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

22:23 Wendy Arroyo asks, "What's my place in life if not to throw an expensive piece of technology at another equally or more expensive piece of technology?"

22:24 Elaine says to Wendy, "Guided missiles actually exist. But ramming could be fun."

22:24 Wendy Arroyo says, "Also Melinda would stop whining I jam her feed."

22:24 A group a table over have a conversation about pilots from other alliances while rolling their eyes and shaking their heads.

22:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:27 Wendy Arroyo says, "So what's with the sudden deathly silence."

22:27 Nicolette Lawrence scrambles to her feet.

22:27 Nicolette Lawrence rolls out.

22:28 Nicolette Lawrence just arrived.

22:28 Nicolette Lawrence sits down on a cushy booth seat.

22:28 A pilot at a nearby table excitedly describes a recent find in deep space.

22:29 Nissi Valdaire shrugs.

22:29 Melinda Michaels glances down at her tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

22:29 Wendy says to Nissi, "Well, not from you, you're excused."

22:30 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "We shove off in half an hour if anybody else is catching this train ride."

22:30 Damien Goss just arrived.

22:30 Nissi Valdaire says, "Thanks."

22:30 Damien Goss waves.

22:30 Nissi Valdaire waves.

22:30 Melinda Michaels waves.

22:30 Wendy Arroyo pats Nissi Valdaire on the back. "No problem."

22:30 Damien says to Nissi, "I heard you had a mishap."

22:31 Elaine Moreau says, "Guess I should get my things."

22:31 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "I did!"

22:31 Damien Goss asks, "Recover all right?"

22:31 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sorta. The money isn't an issue anyway."

22:31 You hear Melinda Michaels's silver flat einrophone ringing.

22:32 Damien Goss nods. "Well if there's anything I can do to help, let me know."

22:32 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Ooh, what happened?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "Melinda your phone."

22:32 Nissi Valdaire says, "Somebody called you."

22:32 Melinda says to Nissi, "Oh?"

22:32 Melinda Michaels grins.

22:32 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:32 Melinda Michaels says, "Felo, bring it."

22:32 Elaine says to Melinda, "Taking Nocturnal?"

22:32 Melinda Michaels nods to Elaine Moreau.

22:32 Damien Goss says, "I'm going to be covered in felo fur again."

22:32 Elaine Moreau nods.

22:33 Damien Goss sighs.

22:33 Elaine Moreau slinks out.

22:33 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person tugboat "Herding Felo" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

22:33 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:33 Melinda Michaels asks, "Wait, is he a mean one?"

22:33 Lily says to Melinda, "Is this a big crowd? If so, could dock Happy and Shule and I cna sleep in there."

22:33 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Then sure, if you want."

22:33 Melinda says to Lily, "It's not."

22:33 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

22:33 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Aww."

22:33 Wendy says to Nissi, "Did you explode?"

22:33 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "I did!"

22:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't recommend it."

22:34 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:34 Wendy says to Nissi, "That's not bad for your health. Don't let me tell you how to live your life, but you shouldn't explode too often."

22:34 Wendy Arroyo gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Not good, even."

22:34 Nissi Valdaire grins.

22:34 Damien Goss says, "Everything in moderation as they say."

22:34 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Let me check the quarters."

22:34 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

22:34 Melinda Michaels just went into the stairway to the garage.

22:35 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah Nissi everywhere is... Nissi everywhere!"

22:35 Lily Kaise grins.

22:35 Nissi Valdaire says, "I should gather my stuff. Not that it takes long."

22:35 Lily Kaise grins.

22:35 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:35 Melinda Michaels says, "So 2 then I dunno who else needs one."

22:36 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I took one."

22:36 Wendy Arroyo says, "I need one."

22:36 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Goss can let ya in though if need be."

22:36 Damien says to Melinda, "I do not have a roomate, just so you know."

22:36 Melinda Michaels nods to Damien Goss.

22:36 Lily says to Melinda, "Need a key if you have a spare."

22:36 Melinda says to Damien, "I didn't think you did because Morris is with Ali."

22:36 Wendy says to Melinda, "Oh yeah, sorry for the late notice, but I think I'm going to come after all."

22:36 Damien says to Melinda, "And if need be I can sleep in my ship."

22:36 Damien Goss says, "If the gener thing doesn't work right."

22:36 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay Damien."

22:37 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "We are."

22:37 Damien Goss turns on his white swivel einrophone and taps at it briefly.

22:37 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Let me see."

22:37 Melinda Michaels trudges out.

22:37 A pair of pilots lean in close to one another, whispering gossip to one another and tittering quietly.

22:37 Nicolette Lawrence says, "These things always fill up. It doesn't matter where the trip is to, it could be to a garbage dump, everybody would want to go."

22:38 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

22:38 Wendy Arroyo says, "SPACE garbage dump. That's the thing."

22:38 Melinda Michaels just arrived.

22:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:38 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Uh, Morris has my keys."

22:38 Melinda Michaels frowns.

22:38 Melinda Michaels glances down at her tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

22:39 Damien Goss says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Morris, you are in so much trouble, report to the lounge."

22:39 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:39 Melinda Michaels says, "Well may as well make a trade or two while we're there."

22:40 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:40 Melinda Michaels asks, "No?"

22:40 Nissi Valdaire just arrived.

22:40 Nissi Valdaire gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

22:40 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

22:40 Melinda Michaels trudges out.

22:40 Damien says to Nissi, "Remember warn me if you are going to be sarcastic, ok?"

22:41 Wendy says to Nissi, "Wait, all this time I was talking to you, and you weren't there?"

22:41 Wendy Arroyo glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

22:41 Lily Kaise blinks.

22:41 Nissi says to Damien, "The Feng Wo officials like it if you lightly nip them on the nose. It's a traditional greeting."

22:41 Nissi Valdaire nods to Wendy Arroyo.

22:41 Melinda Michaels just arrived.

22:41 Damien Goss nods. "I knew I was missing something."

22:41 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:41 Melinda Michaels says, "Kay."

22:41 Wendy says to Nissi, "Evil."

22:42 Damien Goss steps out.

22:42 Damien Goss just arrived.

22:43 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:43 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah we don't want to have to go back for battlesuits."

22:43 A group of pilots is holding an intense meeting on the other side of the room.

22:43 Damien Goss says, "I'm going to go preboard."

22:43 Damien Goss waves.

22:43 Damien Goss steps out.

22:44 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:44 Melinda says to Nissi, "Watch this end up being a hugely expensive module."

22:44 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

22:45 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:45 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay Damien."

22:45 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I don't expect it to be cheap."

22:45 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

22:45 Melinda Michaels says, "Later."

22:45 Lily Kaise says, "And one which requires lots of command."

22:45 Nissi Valdaire grins.

22:45 Melinda Michaels places a silver flat einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

22:45 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hopefully it's worth the trip."

22:45 Melinda Michaels says, "Hope so."

22:45 Lily Kaise says, "Well it's always fun going over there and at least we'll know what's required."

22:45 Wendy Arroyo says, "Any trip is automatically worth itself, like c'mon. Spirit of adventure."

22:46 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Nissi Valdaire's shoulder.

22:46 Melinda Michaels nods.

22:46 Melinda says to Nissi, "You got your chocolate bot?"

22:46 Nissi Valdaire asks, "What if it's a module that accepts megacredits and dispenses fond wishes for your health?"

22:46 Nissi Valdaire nods to Melinda Michaels.

22:46 Melinda Michaels laughs at Nissi Valdaire.

22:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "I put it in obs already."

22:46 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

22:46 Lily Kaise says, "I have nelli but will have to go fetch my hover."

22:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "Also I claimed room five again."

22:47 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I just hope we get all the details about cost and requirements and all that before we pay Tael for the license and then it's not even practical to do."

22:47 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I claimed room six again."

22:47 Lily Kaise says, "We'll tak whichever is available."

22:47 Lily Kaise grins.

22:47 Melinda says to Nissi, "I am gonna just not override that quarters anymore. It's been yours every trip I think."

22:48 Elaine Moreau says to Kani, "Long time no see."

22:48 Elaine Moreau says to Kani, "You left the apartment a total mess. Could barely get to bed."

22:48 A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the steaming beverage.

22:48 Melinda Michaels laughs.

22:49 Kani Kahakai says, "There was one pair of shoes, they aren't even my shoes."

22:49 Elaine Moreau says to Kani, "Literally unliveable."

22:49 Nissi Valdaire says, "Don't suppose we've got Eli along. I haven't seen him for a while."

22:49 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I haven't seen him today either."

22:49 Wendy Arroyo says, "Let's go kidnap him in his sleep."

22:49 Nissi Valdaire nods to Wendy Arroyo.

22:50 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I haven't seen him in four or five days I don't think."

22:50 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Very very little if any."

22:50 You hear the ringing of the nearby ferry and the answering calls of seagulls.

22:50 Kani Kahakai pouts at Elaine Moreau.

22:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:51 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

22:51 Lily Kaise asks, "So we're lifting off in about 9 minutes?"
