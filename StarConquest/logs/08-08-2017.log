Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:17:29 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:53:32 You say, "you can get out."

00:53:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:53:34 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:53:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

00:53:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:53:42 You smile.

00:53:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:53:45 The computer reports that the IFS starship "Battleship 451" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

00:53:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:53:46 [General Communication] Rolando Caganda transmits, "On our way"

00:54:06 You notice Lileah Rose using the radio to ask for landing clearance.

00:54:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Crasher.  The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:54:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:54:16 Lileah Rose says, "ok will go get him"

00:54:19 You ask, "Want me to gun?"

00:54:20 You ask, "Want me to gun?"

00:54:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:54:21 A flashing green light indicates that your news has been updated.

00:54:22 [General Communication] Darren Amari transmits, "it must feel horrible to be ordered around by a new pilot"

01:07:05 You follow Lileah Rose down.

01:07:05 [Starship "Crasher"; Control Room]
Darren Amari and Lileah Rose are here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:07:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:07:11 You are credited with 333333.33 AEU credits of bounty.

01:07:17 Darren Amari says, "how much you reccon the ifs are gonna launch another assault on us"

01:07:23 Darren Amari says, "how much you reccon the ifs are gonna launch another assault on us"

01:07:26 Lileah Rose says to Darren Amari, "well thank you do you need to go back to Old Earth?"

01:07:54 Darren Amari asks, "i do, yes. but first, do you need anything?"

01:08:07 Lileah Rose says, "no I think we're good."

01:08:20 Lileah Rose says, "i'll grab the repair on the turret so just a moment"

01:08:27 Lileah Rose disbands her group.

01:08:28 Lileah Rose just went out.

01:09:01 Lileah Rose just entered the ship.

01:09:04 You notice Lileah Rose using the radio to ask for launch clearance.

01:09:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Crasher, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:09:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:09:12 Lileah Rose exclaims, "this is a huge relief!"

01:09:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:09:20 Lileah Rose says, "i've been dodging that stupid thing"

01:09:23 Darren Amari smiles at Lileah Rose.

01:09:24 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:09:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

01:09:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:09:31 Darren Amari says to Lileah Rose, "couldn't have done it wout help"

01:09:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:09:35 Lileah Rose says, "nope"

01:09:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:09:36 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:09:37 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

01:09:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:09:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:09:57 Darren Amari says to Lileah Rose, "well done for keeping calm when we got smashed"

01:09:57 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:10:01 You notice Lileah Rose using the radio to ask for landing clearance.

01:10:04 Lileah Rose says, "naa no big"

01:10:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Crasher.  The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:10:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:10:13 Lileah Rose says to Darren Amari, "nice to meet you"

01:10:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:10:16 Lileah Rose smiles.

01:10:26 Darren Amari says to Lileah Rose, "now, let me tell you something. something very important. that, was my first fight. ever."

01:10:33 Lileah Rose glances around.

01:10:34 Darren Amari says to Lileah Rose, "you too."

01:10:46 Lileah Rose says, "well you sure paid attention in your training"

01:10:49 Lileah Rose smiles.

01:11:08 Lileah Rose says, "i'm not as coordinated. I love Exploration and I probably barely passed combat"

01:11:09 Darren Amari says, "i never pay atention in training. ever"

01:11:14 Lileah Rose laughs.

01:11:34 Darren Amari says, "knocked my instructure out and took his battlecruiser into an invasion solo"

01:11:41 Lileah Rose says, "oh my"

01:11:59 Darren Amari says, "loved every second of it"

01:12:00 Lileah Rose says, "I do wonder whose Battlecruiser that is on our Landing Pad too. I hadn't seen it before"

01:12:09 Lileah Rose exclaims, "I bet!"

01:12:33 Darren Amari says, "the ifs were like no, back off, back off. i was like nah."

01:12:56 Darren Amari says, "was havin way to much fun by that point"

01:13:14 Lileah Rose says, "wow well if we can get our pilot ranks increased, we probably could have some fun."

01:13:25 Darren Amari says, "definatly"

01:13:47 Lileah Rose says, "did this ship handle all right? I know there are upgrades but will be awhile before I can qualify"

01:13:50 Darren Amari says, "you seem like the type to throw themselves into stuff head first. rspect granted"

01:13:57 Lileah Rose exclaims, "I try!"

01:14:00 Lileah Rose smiles.

01:14:06 Lileah Rose says, "pat roland"

01:14:20 Lileah Rose exclaims, "he is pretty daring too!"

01:14:28 Lileah Rose says, "we were going to take up a Corvette"

01:14:40 Darren Amari says, "corvettes are sick"

01:14:52 Lileah Rose says, "yeah, that is a lot of lasers"

01:15:04 Darren Amari says, "taking on 45 warships in an unupgraded corvette. fun as hell"

01:15:10 Lileah Rose says, "uh ok"

01:15:42 Darren Amari says to Lileah Rose, "yeah, your never gonna let me come on missions, are ya. you probably think i'm crazy"

01:16:03 Lileah Rose says, "of course! you really seem to handle the controls well."

01:16:12 Darren Amari asks, "even though i'm crazy?"

01:16:20 Lileah Rose exclaims, "heck yeah!"

01:16:22 Lileah Rose laughs.

01:16:28 You laugh.

01:17:07 Darren Amari says, "hey, being crazy helps. you don't mind when you're dragged out of your home by outsiders and stuck beig torchered for 2 years of your life"

01:17:14 Lileah Rose blinks.

01:17:15 Lileah Rose says, "wow"

01:17:38 Darren Amari says, "i didn't learn from a human instructure. i learned from them."

01:17:39 Lileah Rose says, "well I'd say that's survival right there."

01:32:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

01:32:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:33:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:33:15 [General Communication] Darren Amari transmits, "are there ever more pilots around tahn this? if so, i'd rather they not find out about the outsider thing"

01:33:17 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

01:33:22 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

01:33:27 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a detached sensor component.

01:33:38 [General Communication] Rolando Caganda transmits, "I don't see very many around."

01:44:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:44:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:44:31 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

01:44:36 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

01:44:41 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be some stray nebular matter.

01:46:39 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as a piece of debris is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

Debris
------
Mass: Moderate
Coordinates: (7, 11, 9)
Distance: 5

01:46:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:46:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:46:58 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

01:47:04 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

01:47:09 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a defunct sector probe.

01:48:58 You ask, "The Jinu ship is in 26, right?"

01:49:02 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:49:04 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

01:49:10 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

01:49:14 Lileah Rose says to you, "yes Love"

01:49:15 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a drifting cloud of tritium.

A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:16:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:16:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:16:41 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

02:16:41 Lileah Rose asks, "oh is the jinu gone?"

02:16:49 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:16:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sandbagger.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:16:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:16:58 You say, "It's not. I just need to stare for a few minutes."

02:17:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:17:05 Lileah Rose says, "ah ok love"

02:17:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There are quite a lot of RATS every day!"

02:19:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That there are."

02:21:05 [General Communication] Darren Amari transmits, "coffee ended up winning"

02:25:51 You kiss Lileah Rose.

02:25:53 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:25:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:25:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:25:58 Lileah Rose kisses you.

02:26:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:26:11 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Hello."

02:26:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Heya rat man."

02:26:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:26:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:26:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:26:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:55:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:55:06 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

02:55:08 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:55:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:55:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:55:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:55:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:55:52 The Jinu starship "Yuuijuminlakiltra" has a docking bay large enough to contain this ship.  You can request entry into its docking bay, or dock in the usual manner by connecting to the docking ring near the control room.

02:55:53 Would you like to request entry into the docking bay?

You see an internal stun turret here.
You can go out and into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:59:15 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

02:59:17 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

02:59:20 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow.  Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

02:59:30 [General Communication] Darren Amari transmits, "you two still trading?"

02:59:30 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

Lileah Rose (sitting on a large leather lounge couch) is here.
You can go south and out.

02:59:43 You power up the ship's engines, and the docking bay door begins to open slowly.

02:59:44 Lileah Rose says to you, "what's out there?"

02:59:45 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit, do you wish to unsuit now?

02:59:45 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:59:46 Lileah Rose grins.

02:59:46 You remove the elements of your spacesuit and fold them neatly into a standard starship flightbag.

02:59:48 A launch trajectory is located.

02:59:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:59:53 You kiss Lileah Rose.

02:59:57 I can't find "scouch."

02:59:58 Lileah Rose kisses you.

03:49:50 A launch trajectory is located.

03:49:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:50:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

03:50:21 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

03:50:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What? What AEU aggression? I'm confused here."

03:50:53 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

03:50:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:51:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:51:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:51:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "None. They're just issuing some random statement."

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

03:51:34 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:51:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:51:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just checked with Aisling. It looks like the council is just trying to get ahead of the curve, as it will. I have my own opinions for such stupid moves, but there we are."

03:51:48 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm currently stranded on nuveau quebec. Is there any way possible for me to get picked up out here? I'd be willing to pay, up to 4000000 credits of any alliance currency for transport back to station "foxtrot"."

03:52:06 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

03:52:07 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Only if my ship comes with a brig, which it doesn't. So, stay there."

03:52:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:52:16 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

03:52:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

03:52:22 Lileah Rose yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

03:52:51 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

03:52:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sandbagger.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:52:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:53:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:53:20 You pick up a blue chinasilk blouse.

03:53:24 You give a blue chinasilk blouse to Lileah Rose.

03:53:28 Lileah Rose suddenly awakens.

03:55:31 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 140,838.94 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

03:55:44 Lileah Rose pulls a blue chinasilk blouse on over her head.

03:55:55 Lileah Rose stands up.

03:56:32 Lileah Rose yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

03:56:45 You hold Lileah Rose's hand, taking her into your group.

03:56:52 I can't find "lilieah."

03:56:56 You pull Lileah Rose towards you.

03:56:58 You'll have to stand up first.

03:57:00 You stand up.

03:57:39 I don't understand that.

03:57:43 I don't understand that.

03:57:46 I don't understand that.

03:58:04 I don't understand that.

03:58:08 I don't understand that.

03:58:29 You're not wearing some black leather boots.

03:58:33 You don't have some black leather boots.

03:58:43 You lie down on a small bunk.

03:58:45 You stand up.

03:58:49 I can't find "other bed."

03:58:53 You lie down on a walnut canopy bed.

03:58:54 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]

03:58:55 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, a cedar dresser, and a set of funky asymmetrical shelves here.

(You are lying on a walnut canopy bed.)

04:00:17 [General Communication] A howler monkey transmits, "WORKER'S PARADISE!"

04:00:44 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Looks like we've got a lot of active ace pilots."

04:03:03 Lileah Rose suddenly awakens.

04:03:10 Lileah Rose kisses you.

04:03:37 Lileah Rose removes a pair of white leather sandals from her feet.

You stand there, glowing with near nudity.

04:04:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm not particularly comfortable picking someone up who would punch someone for no reason. So...It won't be me."

04:04:45 You're already lying down.

04:04:57 You kiss Lileah Rose.

04:05:00 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

04:05:03 You say to Lileah Rose, "I love you."

04:05:19 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

04:05:28 Lileah Rose says to you, "I love you too sexy man."

04:05:30 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I wouldn't worry. There are plenty of suckers for lost causes who believe that everyone deserves a second chance. Or a third, or a fourth, or a fifth depending on how many times he's punched the bus driver."

04:05:33 Lileah Rose giggles quietly.

04:06:01 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well, I'd like to wonder how you became a rogue pilot."

04:06:06 You smile at Lileah Rose.

04:06:15 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Don't go there, buddy."

04:06:19 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I actually became one by doing what's right. Didn't end up punching anyone, neither."

04:06:35 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Really. How does doing what's right, get you rogue status?"

04:06:43 You say to Lileah Rose, "You look tired so ?I'll try not to touch you all over in your sleep."

04:06:47 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "His government is doing what is wrong."

04:06:55 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Read your news."

04:07:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well said, Ash."

04:07:09 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cause apparently answering a distress call is no longer one of our deep-rooted values. Surprised me as much as anyone else did."

04:07:38 You grin at Lileah Rose.

04:07:38 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Which government? I didn't see an alliance tag when I checked the communicator status of active comlinks."

04:07:44 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa chortles.

04:08:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If you read your news...It won't take much effort to figure that one out."

04:08:07 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Perhaps you should read your news then if you cannot figure that out."

04:08:28 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz assaults your ears with a burst of static and screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs, "WOAH WOAH WOAH!"

04:08:33 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Someone punched the bus driver again?"

04:08:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes Keegan."

04:08:47 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I am pretty sure the Ninth Fleet and Council just made it abundantly clear."

04:09:04 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "The AEU?"

04:09:11 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach gasps.

04:09:29 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Where're they at? I've got a hankering for some fisticuffs."

04:09:37 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Stuck at NQ."

04:09:38 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "And maybe a touch of assault with stun weaponry."

04:09:41 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Oh."

04:09:43 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz sighs.

04:09:53 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I'm too lazy for that, and then they'd probably expect a ride home."

04:10:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "He's offering 4 million credits if someone will go pick him up."

04:10:06 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "There's also the whole Free Port Doctrine thing."

04:10:39 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do what I would do. Build a temp station with a fusion battery on it, stick him there. Let him cool off and catch up on current events for a couple months, then the station's escape pod will take him home."

04:11:14 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bam. You inadvertently offerred him a ride home!"

04:11:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.

04:11:30 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am truly glorious philanthropist."

04:11:41 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "A real charmer."

04:12:04 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "You sound like one. Remind me to send you a Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event card, will you?"

04:12:21 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I actually would probably just end up tossing it out along with the other ones I tend to get."

04:12:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

04:12:46 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I try to tell people politely not to send me that shit without sending them one back, but most of them are too caught up in themselves to get the message."

04:13:07 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "So instead we send him boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes."

04:13:18 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Actually finally seemed to work last year. No one sent me anything."

04:13:33 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hey, you know that was a genius present, Keegers!"

04:13:40 [General Communication] James Donovan laughs.

04:14:02 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one else thought of it!"

04:14:20 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

04:14:26 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

04:15:57 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz chuckles.

04:16:52 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'll send Ather 16 lenses and prove that he doesn't always throw things into trash."

04:17:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Send me those fuckers. I'll take care of 'em."

04:17:09 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "This is true."

04:17:26 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But I know you won't send me 16 lenses. People tend to send me only the trash-throwing shit."

04:17:58 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "How about a hundred tael?"

04:17:59 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I have never sent you trash-throwing shit, ever."

04:18:11 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think you sent me the omnilocks, right?"

04:18:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I did once, yeah."

04:18:37 You kiss Lileah Rose.

04:18:40 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

04:18:46 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, I definitely didn't throw yours in the trash. I sent money!"

04:18:57 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, it wasn't an annual festive holiday gift."

04:19:01 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You did, way more than they were worth."

04:19:35 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Incidentally, I am still buying omnilocks, at double the price they're being sold for on SSN! Buy them, send them to me, and I will send you money!"

04:19:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "How many you needing?"

04:20:06 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "20 or so will be good for the short-term."

04:20:19 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Done. I shall manage this thing."

04:20:31 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

04:21:03 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

04:22:52 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'd rather be stuck on that prison moon than out here. Not a pilot around worth a damn, and no ships to steal neither. You wonder what a man thinks when he's got nowhere to go, and nothing to do?"

04:23:19 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "No ships to steal? Good going."

04:23:40 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, it seems that nobody but those french folks even come out this way."

04:23:52 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Ain't seen noone but locals."

04:25:05 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'one hour.'"

04:25:11 Lileah Rose says to you, "I so love you. I'll say nite now. Rest well and sweet dreams."

04:25:18 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

04:25:41 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I...don't even have words."

04:26:11 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Come out here and join me, make sure to blow up your ship in the process. Do that, and you'll get the words all right."

04:26:31 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "You can try to steal things and such, I suppose. Our prisons are less luxurious than moon prison, though."

04:26:35 You say to Lileah Rose, "Good night. Rest well and sweet dreams. I love you too."

04:26:46 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

04:26:52 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

04:26:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Why would I blow up a perfectly good ship? That's just stupid."

04:27:07 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

04:27:09 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

04:27:13 Lileah Rose snuggles up close to you, wrapping her arms around you.

04:27:13 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "WUI WUI mosuer. But, there's nothing of value here for me at the moment."

04:27:21 You lovingly snuggle up to Lileah Rose.

04:27:25 Lileah Rose smiles.

04:27:32 Lileah Rose pulls you close and snuggles on your shoulder.

04:28:02 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Why? I don't know, just so you can be trapped here with no way home I suppose."

04:28:31 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I think I'll pass. I like all my ships quite well."

04:28:51 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And, prisons don't cost 100000 credits a night for a room. That's what tax payers are for."

04:29:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And if I somehow managed to lose a ship and get stuck out there. I guarantee you a friend would come get me. Because...Oh right. I didn't punch a bus driver."

04:29:10 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sleep on the docking bay like a common begger. Maybe someone will take pity on you."

04:29:59 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I can just see you doing that. You, and that kind loving attitude of yours."

04:32:20 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am, as I said, glorious philanthropist! I can have a fusion temp station ready to go in moments."

04:32:54 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, and leave me stranded somewhere for months? Just for punching a bus driver, you've got as much sense, or rather, you don't."

04:33:28 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "If you ever did that to someone for something short of murder or grand larcany, you should be locked up yourself."

04:33:31 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner". The organization has earned 642,632.66 credits.

04:33:31 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Just for?"

04:33:31 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm going to regret asking this. I know it. But why would you punch him. Anyway?"

04:33:42 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "And you are making threats of stealing ships?"

04:33:46 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I was mad as hell."

04:33:56 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And, I've only gotten madder sense I got stranded here."

04:34:09 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I was the only person he brought to this place in the middle of nowhere."

04:34:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So you're all pissy, and you decide to punch a bus driver. That logic doesn't even add up."

04:34:20 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "But him and his criffing schedule."

04:34:49 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm actually more of a fan of certain other punishments for murderers, myself!"

04:34:59 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I was ready to leave hours ago, and I knew I'd be the only passenger."

04:35:07 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Hitting on your ride is generally inadvisable move."

04:35:19 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "The dude just waisted battery power, as he flew back to the arm alone."

04:35:25 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If I'm missing something here. Someone please explain. But. That just makes zero sense."

04:35:42 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Wasted battery power?"

04:35:42 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I was there. Not a sole boarded his transport, and he kept shoving me out the damn airlock."

04:36:12 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "He could've made some real cash."

04:36:12 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Leaguers should definitely think of trying to shut up this guy sooner rather than later."

04:36:36 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Ali, go to it!"

04:36:40 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "He doesn't make any money you know, and he could've charged me millions, and I'd of paid him."

04:36:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...I think there's only one around. But at least he holds an office."

04:38:02 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Bus driver receives super generous salary from mighty Nouveau Quebec Ministry of Tourism, or maybe a different one. Many of them, you know."

04:38:24 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, when it comes to you repeatedly punching someone just because they have a schedule to keep, I understand why he wouldn't want to be cooped up on a ship with you for potentially hours. You represented a clear and present threat. I'd have told you to go fuck yourself and flown off on my own too."

04:38:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Agreed."

04:38:52 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "A schedule to keep? You make it sound like he was in a hurry."

04:39:08 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one runs on "James'" time. They run on their schedules. If you can't work with their schedules, then either bring your own stupid transport next time or don't go at all."

04:39:56 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The spacebus has, and will always have a schedule. There is no reason that I can see that he could've changed that scheduled departure just for the likes of you."

04:40:00 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I will. Me, the cadet, will go magically bring his rift drive capable transport with enough charge to fly for several hours straight."

04:40:31 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Try cutting power to your mouth. Might boost charge."

04:40:54 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And, how would I get my handstr g I've got nothing else to do."

04:41:07 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Obviously too late for right now, but you should've realized when you were going on the spacebus that no one cares when you want to leave, your time is not relevant."

04:41:33 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "You'd think they'd run more than one per day."

04:41:52 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "What does the guy do for the other 20 hours."

04:41:52 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Front them your generous 4 million credits for the pickup and maybe they'll consider it."

04:41:54 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa chortles.

04:42:36 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I ffing will. As long as you aren't the pilot, then I may just have a reason to punch someone else. You've gotten me even more riled up than I was earlier."

04:42:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "This is all too amusing. I've hardly noticed that I'm out hauling roids alone."

04:42:43 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Can't possibly be that he might have a wife? A family? Maybe a business? Regardless, what business is it of yours?"

04:43:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So...Now you're threatening whoever comes to get you?"

04:43:23 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Keep talking, champ. Keep talking."

04:43:23 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "No, I'm not."

04:43:28 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm just mad at her."

04:43:35 [General Communication] Aisling laughs.

04:43:49 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am now marginally intreagued."

04:43:52 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh man. Okay, okay.. that's just too much."

04:44:21 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just for that comment, I'm going to look forward to seeing you back. Cause I'm going to strand your ass soon as I see you for calling me a her."

04:44:37 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Let's see. I've got, let's say, another 23 and a half hours to wait?"

04:44:45 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "This is bad for tourism. Save us, Honorable Premier Maxime Roberge!"

04:44:51 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And hopefully he'll still tell you to go fuck yourself when he sees you again."

04:45:10 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Ather, you sound like a her, and you've got that cat-fighting mentality too."

04:45:19 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "In fact, Mr. Busdriver, I will donate 500 million credits to the spacebus industry thing if you ban him from all future travel on your bus!"

04:45:27 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "How the hell was I supposed to know. It's not like we've met."

04:45:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Wait wait. Now you're saying all women cat fight?"

04:46:01 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Keep talking bruh."

04:46:10 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "No, I'm just saying, she reminds me of that attitude."

04:46:15 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Or he, or whatever the hell."

04:47:01 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've got nothing else to do, (he looks at his watch), for another 23 hours."

04:47:12 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would like to apologize to the league for the future things that I'm going to do to their cadet."

04:48:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ather? Do me a favor and record all of it."

04:49:01 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Ather, You think I have a bad mouth? All those snied threats are going to land you in a prison somewhere."

04:49:25 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Throwing punches at random people will."

04:49:42 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sorry, but I have to agree with Aisling on that one."

04:49:46 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, but I never threatened to strand someone."

04:49:56 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "No, only to steal ships."

04:49:57 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "They aren't threats if they're going to be carried out. At least I'm actually aiming my desire for destruction towards the intended target. Not some innocent person who was just doing their job."

04:50:24 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Why did he punch the spacebus driver?"

04:50:30 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And in what universe, does the legal system punnish a common brawler with a month's solitary inprisonment in the middle of nowhere? That sounds like something our enemies would do, not us."

04:50:33 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cause he's a fucking lunatic."

04:51:04 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "That was after I got stranded, mind you."

04:51:41 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Supposedly he was saying that the busdriver wouldn't budge from his schedule cause poor pretty little James wanted to go home early or some shit."

04:51:53 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's about the jist of it."

04:51:55 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well get naked and enjoy yourself."

04:52:03 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Where did you learn your misconceptions about law and order from anyway. The IFS, or the lambda pirates."

04:52:19 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

04:52:46 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Sounds like something a pirate would do, strand someone for a month."

04:53:00 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Stealing ships is something a pirate would do."

04:53:05 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You're a funny, funny guy."

04:53:21 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yes, I criffing am. Ha ha ha."

04:53:34 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Is joke."

04:53:48 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And, if you were trapped somewhere, with no means of rescue, what would or wouldn't you do to get home, to survive."

04:53:54 You smile at Lileah Rose.

04:53:56 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

04:54:05 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner". The organization has earned 225,171.90 credits.

04:54:24 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm surprised this place has any tourism at all, seeing as there's only one way for most people to get here."

04:55:05 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'thirty minutes.'"

04:55:15 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Yes, the one way is to travel through space."

04:55:44 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Imagine if Feng Wo had a bus."

04:55:53 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh, I guess for him, being stranded on a space station with a bunch of naked people is a punishment. Wow."

04:55:58 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "You have to have a rift drive, or take the space bus, and to do either, you have to go through mutuality space. I'm not just talking about us pilots, but about any other civilians that may wish to travel here."

04:56:02 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "With....a bus schedule!"

04:56:54 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Back where I come from, our transportation didn't run only once a day, but outland city was always a quaint settlement."

04:58:12 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "There's plenty of civilians that get there, just not that many regs."

04:58:38 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "And I'm sure that civilians are happy to stay longer than an hour."

04:58:54 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Yeah there's a hotel and everything."

04:59:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How's it going out there, Dak?"

04:59:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I got a nice roid earlier, and just hauled in a somewhat disappointing comet. But it was different and that was cool."

04:59:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."

05:00:11 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And civilians who come here, probably plan on spending a lot of criffing time here. They probably don't come here, and have their entire livelyhood threatened by unplanned stays."

05:00:27 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Or maybe they do, if they miss the space bus."

05:00:36 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Were you not just earlier offering 4M creds for anyone to come and pick you up?"

05:00:42 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I still am."

05:00:45 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Did you not say that each night cost you 100K?"

05:00:50 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I highly doubt you're at a huge risk."

05:01:00 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you act like there's no food or water out there."

05:01:07 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "But, there's a difference. Back in home space, I could have that 4 million back in a few hours."

05:01:08 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also no one is going to do that for 4 million."

05:01:10 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "It's a nice place."

05:01:27 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "You assaulted the driver. This is a situation purely of your own creation."

05:01:30 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Out here, it's all I have."

05:01:41 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Ah... But of course, reg clearly wanted most special treatment, where he is fanned with grapes and fed ferns."

05:01:48 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would just wait and try apologizing to the driver tomorrow."

05:01:54 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Ah, a clan trader."

05:01:55 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "And the spacebus leaves on his schedule."

05:02:03 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Hahaha!"

05:02:04 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Anfisa.. I think that might be backwards? Or maybe that's the joke."

05:02:07 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yes, then he sleeps for 20 hours."

05:02:31 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, if he even criffing bothers."

05:02:37 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Do not think bus driver is such narcoleptic."

05:02:45 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Or a cat."

05:02:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacons?"

05:02:48 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I wish I could purchase usefull things here, but sadly, nothing of the sort."

05:02:53 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "He's probably having fun in there."

05:02:56 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Seriously, can you please stop whining, go get naked up there and enjoy yourself? Se It's not like they are torturing you."

05:03:21 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And there's food, drink, and furnniture you can buy up there and an inn even."

05:03:23 Lileah Rose yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

05:03:35 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm having a lot of fun in the docking bay, staring around at the noticible lack of starships. I guess the locals don't get out much."

05:03:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Sure, sounds good."

05:04:12 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Your four millions will last you until somenone eventually pick you up, I assure you."

05:04:12 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Imagine that many people live on space stations. And do not travel. Incredible."

05:04:16 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Where's the criffing star taxi service when you need it, and they don't allow civilian pilots to request their services."

05:05:08 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "This is mostly a tourist area by the looks of it, and you'd think with the maple and stuff they make here, they'd have a thriving import export business, with ships in and out all the time."

05:05:32 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Not a single trade or export ship sense I've been here."

05:07:37 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm surprised the marzore clan or some other trading organization inside the mutuality doesn't have business dealings here."

05:08:59 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "It wouldn't be any of your business if they did or didn't."

05:09:32 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "It would, if I stood in the docking bay all day, looking for ships. I'd be happy to see a smuggler right about now."

05:10:09 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You sure about that? He might harvest your organs him or herself."

05:11:01 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well then, I'd be dead wouldn't I. At this point, I'd be willing to take risk. The only ships I wouldn't want to see would be outsiders or ifs."

05:11:40 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, throw on a space suit and jump. There's a risk there. You might make it back, but you probably won't."

05:12:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Will resist urge to weigh in."

05:12:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's been trying."

05:13:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It is in my own best interests not to."

05:13:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Guy has been prattling on like a child for the better part of an hour."

05:13:13 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "You don't think I haven't tried that? It'd be easier with a distress beacon and a spacesuit, people would be more likely to stop. I just need a spacesuit jet, and a way to override these damn airlock controls. Then, maybe, passing ships might take a damn interest for a change.. There'd at least be more to look at."

05:13:31 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "They keep these airlocks sealed."

05:13:49 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "They would laugh at the silly reg."

05:13:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Dude. I'm sorry. But...How long have you been there? The way you're whining and whining. you'd swear you were stuck on a deserted planet. and you'd been there half a year."

05:14:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Constantine knows my favorite beacon...he can um...go there if he likes with this guy and um talk to him."

05:14:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

05:14:48 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well, time passes so criffing slowly here, that it would most certainly feel like a year, even if a only a day has past. The way I am right now, I know without a doubt, that sleeping is impossible."

05:14:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "At the rate things are going, he'll either never get a ride back, or get a ride with the very, very wrong person."

05:15:06 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'ten minutes.'"

05:15:13 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Go over to the area of culture and look at people."

05:15:17 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "All I have left to do is argue with you and look at flight control. At least that gives me something to do."

05:15:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...I guess that's your problem. But for the love of all sanity, stop whining."

05:16:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Wonder if I am the "wrong person" you speak of?"

05:16:19 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Like I said, it gives me something to do, and until I find something of worth or interest, either a way to make money, or to get off this station, that's what I'll have to resort to."

05:16:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, I was thinking more along the lines of hitching a ride with someone from Clan Chevlier."

05:16:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Also. Just think. If you spent less time arguing and being stupid. And more time being polite. And maybe had quite a bit of regret for what you did. You'd probably be on your way home."

05:17:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or something along those lines."

05:17:29 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I don't know though. The way ather's been talking, even if I acted like an angel after what I did, I'd probably still be here, throwing fake snowballs at the ceiling."

05:17:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well you'll never know now, will you. You clearly chose the stupid path."

05:18:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The Free Port Doctrine only protects you as long as you are on the station. If he gets on board a ship with just anyone, they could fly off with him and never been sen again."

05:18:29 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "The stupid path. That's pretty funny."

05:18:39 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I might've behaved a little differently if that criffing ace pilot hadn't wound me up."

05:19:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Your problem for letting him wind you up then, isn't it?"

05:19:08 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You're pretty easy to rattle if you let Ather get under your skin."

05:19:13 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "But I'm not going to just sit here, and listen to people talk about me. I will respond, no matter how stupid I sound. That may just be a flaw with me, but it's who I am."

05:19:24 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "As far as I can tell, he's only serious about the mean things he says half of the time."

05:19:45 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've never met the dude. For all I knew, he was serious."

05:19:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'd say more like...73.57% of the time, but yeah."

05:20:05 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What did Ather say?"

05:20:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Didn't this incident with the driver happen way before Ather came on comms?"

05:20:13 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And if you'd never heard of someone, and some ace pilot you didn't know started threatening to strand you for a month, would you just sit still?"

05:20:35 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah I feel like you are misrepresenting Ather's role in you burning your bridges with every person."

05:20:49 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well I wouldn't tempt the pilot to do it in the first place. Because...I'm not stupid."

05:20:50 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yes, it did. But I didn't get seriously riled until she started threatening to strand me."

05:21:01 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Oops, what?"

05:21:07 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lordy."

05:21:17 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And he's been gon e from comms for quite a while now. Pretty sure he went to sleep."

05:21:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ather, is a guy. Stop with the calling him a woman shit."

05:21:37 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've only started burning bridges with you all when he came along."

05:21:50 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Well at least he knows what he is doing."

05:21:53 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So one guy pisses you off and you burn all the bridges? All of them?"

05:22:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "All of them, apparently."

05:22:32 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Ather. And, how was I supposed to know he is a guy? There's no, "ather's" a guy as part of his name or comlink info. That name to me sounds like it could go either way."

05:23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "He can keep this up all he wants. Who wants popcorn?"

05:23:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

05:23:26 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, let's change the subject."

05:23:29 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacons!"

05:23:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey its not my nuts on the fire today for once. I want to have a feast."

05:23:34 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "0 for capsules."

05:23:39 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh."

05:23:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or more than 0 for bigger ships."

05:23:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Why haven't we cleaned the vents yet? I could so use that vodka."

05:23:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man, let's clean the vents."

05:23:57 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was just waiting for you to say it."

05:24:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "2 for vents clearing!"

05:24:13 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Bring us all the plasma you got!"

05:24:14 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Damn. Vent cleaning means I can't use that new suit."

05:25:38 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If we can get a fourth."

05:25:45 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll swap suits begrudgingly."

05:25:50 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Plasma is sexy, after all."

05:25:52 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"

05:25:57 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "New earth lounge."

05:26:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Vernos, keep your eye open for a sector alert on Frontier Cluster while we're in there."

05:26:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What suit should I bring? EAOS 5?"

05:26:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you don't mind."

05:26:20 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'd much rather run AEU for this. Eli. Could you bring league. Maybe?"

05:26:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "RATs 5?"

05:26:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, definitely Eli."

05:26:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Al the fives?"

05:26:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, you have a rats 5?"

05:26:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Indeed."

05:27:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm. Either of those would be way better than what Dak and I can bring."

05:27:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm about 6 sectors out with this roid, so I might be a minute."

05:27:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sure."

05:27:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if she doesn't want to do League, what can we do."

05:27:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have a League 2, but that might be a little weak."

05:27:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well I can bring League I suppose."

05:27:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Let's bet on success."

05:27:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "My poor dusty EAOS and RATS suits..."

05:27:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Bring your Rat or EAOS."

05:28:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll try to league it up."

05:28:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Bring the RATS! I want to ask you all sorts of questions about it."

05:28:34 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, Eve, you're good in AEU. Eli will bring damage and I'll try League."

05:28:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What tier was that League again?"

05:29:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "2."

05:29:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is this a crazy idea?"

05:32:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm just running to get my AEU. Double league would not be fun."

05:32:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I might need to do some mod swapping, pretty sure I'm gonna want lots of energy, and I think all I have on this RATs is nanite boost stuff."

05:32:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...technically flying."

05:32:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No problem, take your time. I think Dak needs to set up his suit anyhow."

05:33:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Whoa, I have an empty slot? Weird."

05:33:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"

05:33:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Man, I want one of those."

05:34:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Why the heck is my RATS at Space Vermin command?"

05:34:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

05:34:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Odd, I've never qualified to do any of those missions."

05:42:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Finally in the sector with the station. Remind me to replace the engines as soon as I can."

05:43:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

05:43:55 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner". The organization has earned 271,918.41 credits.

05:45:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Woooah. This is a cool rift."

05:47:27 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Still no criffing ships. And you think the station inhabitants would clean up the place."

05:48:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Is he still whining?"

05:49:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Yes. I think he needs a talking to."

05:49:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, you guys think that one energy cap and regen will be enough, or should I lose the nanite boost and projectile boost to bring 2."

05:50:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably two, huh? So I can just unload?"

05:50:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Try one of each."

05:50:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

05:50:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, why not."

05:53:19 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

05:53:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "How rude."

05:53:50 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "What?"

05:54:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli hung up on me, after I helped him. I see how it is."

05:54:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, I'm in a hurry, I said thanks."

05:54:39 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "These are troubling times."

05:54:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

05:54:53 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, they are."

05:55:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Do you want me to switch all these mods out and get moving, or do you want me to chat it up."

05:55:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's what I thought ya coat thief."

05:56:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

05:56:11 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.

05:58:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This may be a silly question, but is there a downside to using a dual mod? Like will a single greater mod be more useful than the same one that's part of a dual mod?"

05:59:05 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Thought maybe the single ones might be more focused or something?"

05:59:28 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nah. But doubles are just handy because...well, double."

06:00:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So your professional answer is "all the mods"?"

06:00:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "All of them."

06:02:59 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Sings loudly over his communicator, without realizing he is holding down the talk button."

06:04:47 [General Communication] James transmits the sound of perfuse swearing, and banging on docking bay exterior hatches.

06:06:33 [General Communication] James transmits over the sound of his banging madly on docking bay doors, "I wish a criffing ship would show up."

06:07:01 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Even pirates would be welcome, because I doubt anyone would begrudge a stranded person stealing from pirates."

06:07:12 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You better hope they don't hear you."

06:07:23 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I hope they do. I'd like them to."

06:08:28 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Hey pirates! I've got a few million creds and some gear. Come and get it."

06:08:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Man, what a duffer."

06:09:19 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Pirates have little use for your alliance currency."

06:09:40 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Shame, what a criffing shame. I'd have great use for one of their ships right about now."

06:10:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright Vernos, we're heading inside."

06:25:29 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] Frontier Cluster has gone on alert!

06:25:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Here we go."

06:25:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Too quiet."

06:25:44 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Frontier cluster on alert."

06:25:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Beat me to calling it out."

06:27:04 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "One Ares so far."

06:33:16 [Tactical Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Frontier cluster clear."

06:33:24 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks Vernos."

06:33:29 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] Frontier Cluster is standing down.

06:34:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Navy folks got the kill not me."

06:34:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, still."

06:34:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good that you responded to it."

06:45:11 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Whatever happened to Teddy?"

06:45:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Is Teddy still out there?"

06:45:57 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I am sure Teddy is doing well."

06:46:38 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "The tales recount that the Emperor is immortal, sat on mighty throne of eternity powered by many catbots."

06:46:39 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Someone was talking about wanting to camp on an asteorid, made me think of Teddy."

06:46:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er asteroid."

06:54:22 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

07:10:43 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] A space station chief technician transmits, "Old Frontier Processor's vents are now relatively clear. Won't last longer than a few days, but we're going off lockdown for now."

07:47:04 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 8,703,703.70 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the three-person clipper "Thalassocracy".

07:54:22 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

08:13:32 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Hello."

08:16:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, in case you didn' tnkow. The folks you see with a little tag next to thei name are actually out of communications range. There's not as many folks around who can hear you as you might think. Doesn't mean you can't still talk, just didn't want you to think the entire galaxy was ignoring you."

08:16:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Can I ignore you, Eli?"

08:16:41 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. I guess right now, there's more folks around then I thought."

08:16:47 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I understand that. There hasn't been any chatter on here for a while, and I wanted to make sure coms worked on my end."

08:17:35 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You may not ignore me Evenia."

08:17:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh well. I will anyway."

08:18:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Except that you didn't, making me the victor."

08:18:11 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach sighs.

08:18:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Damn it."

08:19:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Now you owe me two golden tael."

08:20:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not a chance."

08:22:15 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 8,703,703.70 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the three-person clipper "Thalassocracy".

08:26:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cheers.

08:27:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I love those."

08:27:18 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "A bastille?"

08:27:29 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's sort of stronger fighter."

08:27:34 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Let's check this cycler out!"

08:27:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah. It's a fighter-class ship. But it's got a stronger hull. And a full-sized grid."

08:27:44 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, sort of?"

08:27:46 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It doesn't have an FTL drive, though, so it will basically be something I use as a novelty."

08:27:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Probably for beacons only."

08:27:55 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh that's nice. Real nice."

08:28:04 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "That sounds nice."

08:28:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "They really are."

08:28:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'd say it's a little better than sort of, in my opinion."

08:28:24 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I will eventually lose it in an overdriven beacon."

08:28:31 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I will then flawlessly complete in my capsule."

08:28:33 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Sounds like a deployment craft, the type you would take when you have a cary ship. Sounds usefull in combat situations, especially if you have multiples."

08:28:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's like...a fighter with a serious shot of kick ass."

08:29:07 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "How many combat points are required for it?"

08:29:09 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Actually James, you're right. They are useful for that."

08:29:13 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "1000."

08:29:23 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And weapons?"

08:29:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Same as the cadet fighter."

08:29:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But with 100% efficiency. No reduced hull or grid."

08:29:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But with a bigger grid it should perform much better."

08:29:53 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

08:30:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Cadet fighter? I take offence to that. I still use my little fighter, even now. Sweet revenge is a tough little thing."

08:30:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, do not understimate the power of the MK III fighter."

08:30:35 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "That's good to know. I've never tested the limits on it."

08:30:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I don't mean to insult them."

08:30:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I use mine all the time."

08:30:50 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I still need training in combat though."

08:31:09 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I don't move fast enough a lot, and criffing rats can do considerable damage."

08:31:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Woo! That last beacon gave me just enough to get those new engines I wanted."

08:31:28 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I know it's just a cadet's thing."

08:31:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice! Hopefully you can get it in spite of the adjusted costs due to missing our goals."

08:31:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "People will take you on beacons. And help you. You just gotta be respectful. And polite. Or...In my case. tell them I'll engineer."

08:31:47 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

08:31:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Now I'm concerned. Hopefully."

08:32:19 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've done beacons once before, and found them to be an educational and rewarding experience. That's where I first learned how combat works in the first place."

08:32:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well. You'll surely be able to get in on more. Just make sure you pay attention to tactical, because that's where we call for people."

08:33:35 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm sorry for yelling at all of you earlier, but I've just never been that far from home before, and without a ship, with nothing familiar to rely upon, it was a great shock. I know I really screwed myself over with that bus driver, and I plan to appologize to him if he gives me the chance."

08:34:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's cool dude. I mean...what you did isn't cool. but I get how a new place. can put you a bit out of your mind."

08:34:52 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I just need more experience with things like that."

08:34:53 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Just make sure you do as you say, and apologize to him."

08:34:58 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I will."

08:35:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And...do me a favor. Please, remember that Ather is a guy."

08:35:32 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

08:35:35 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I will."

08:35:36 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Are we sure?"

08:35:52 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I doubt he is sorry for what he did. He is just sorry he is stuck."

08:36:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Most likely, Aisling. But we will see if he does apologize or not."

08:36:46 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I am sorry for what I did. And I will appologize."

08:36:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What in the hell? Constantine, did you just fucking teleport into the lounge?"

08:37:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Muwahaha!"

08:37:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And Vernos...I'm as sure as I need to be."

08:37:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

08:37:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Cool. I'm glad we cleared the Frontier, I need to grab that battery."

08:38:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"

08:38:28 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Pull-start Evenia. Carbon fuels."

08:39:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.

08:39:09 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Just..."

08:39:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

08:41:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh. Wow, I must be tired. I read 280 as 200. I'm not quite there to this battery, haha."

08:42:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

08:43:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh well! I'm gonna go out and start hauling again unless we have other plans."

08:43:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Still want to do a nest, Eli?"

08:43:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, but I need a few more minutes. Someone needs to go inform Aisling about the thing."

08:44:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries. About which thing, the QSA delegation?"

08:44:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."

08:44:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would love to go meet them all."

08:44:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've only met Aisling once."

08:45:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Come do a quick tesla with me Dak."

08:45:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "While we wait for Eli."

08:45:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you want to."

08:45:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Sure, I'll swap back to Fringe. Do you happen to know what our conquest goals are?"

08:45:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think we know exactly what they are."

08:46:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Vernos has observed that the first one may depend on space combat and industry."

08:46:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We have no industrial whip at the moment, so we have no idea."

08:46:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And the second one may depend on ground and exploration."

08:46:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We haven't hit both since my first week on the job."

08:46:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Industry helps both of them."

08:47:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it's just tough when people are away."

08:47:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh okay."

08:47:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Damn. When'll we get a whip? I'm not sure how often those votings come around."

08:47:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Constantine, the resident coat thief says she will bring League."

08:48:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool."

08:48:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "12 days until the end of the term."

08:48:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh wow, it really flew by."

08:48:49 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I just wish I had a tradecycles deck, and could get somewhere where I could play. I haven't had the pleasure since I joined the league civilian core as a cadet."

08:49:18 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Would any of you know where those can be purchased?"

08:50:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Mostly they are just in some lounges and I think some apartments have them. You can usually get them from tradesman though."

08:51:11 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'll check the lounges when I get back to old earth."

08:51:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok Ash, I'm coming to talk to you again, I hope you are decent."

08:51:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If that's ok?"

08:52:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I suppose I could just call. Phones are a thing."

08:53:02 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "They are. They really are."

08:53:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But then she wouldn't get to meet fat little eli."

08:53:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

08:53:56 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok,  whoa whoa. Hold up. That did not come out right."

08:54:01 [General Communication] James Donovan laughs.

08:54:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.

08:54:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A felo kitten! A Felo kitten!"

08:54:11 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach giggles.

08:54:24 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

09:10:23 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've was able to secure passage off nuveau quebec, and am now on vesta. Does anyone know if there's an ATM in a pilot accessible portion of this planet? I need to convert my mutuality credits, so I can access the ITPN."

09:10:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There.. should be. but holy cow? that was fast?"

09:11:28 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Not really. The trip took over 3 hours, and I paid 3000000 mutuality credits for it, but I'm relieved and glad to be back in home space."

09:11:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok.. Hmm."

09:14:16 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Didn't find an ATM. You'd think, seeing that mainly pilots would have the need to transfer money, there would be one at the spaceport. I guess they never considered that pilots would arrive without their own ship. Vesta, from what I've seen of the place, is a bit up in the air when it comes to giving us civilian pilots access to their planet."

09:14:48 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Is there not a circuit on Vesta?"

09:14:51 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Plenty of merchant activity though, I'd say mainly commercial."

09:15:05 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He needs credit conversion to use the circuit Dakhal."

09:15:07 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "There's a circuit all right, but I need to convert my mutuality credits."

09:15:39 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ah. I guess I've never paid attention to any fees I've used in the circuit."

09:16:14 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "5000 or 10000 EAOS for main circuit, and 5000 league for the league circuit, which is the one I presently need."

09:16:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hang on. Where are you? I'll come pick you up."

09:16:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm already on it, Eve."

09:16:43 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm on vesta, and I'd appreciate it."

09:16:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's not your fault you can't convert credits."

09:17:01 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh cool. You got it, Eli?"

09:17:32 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity...that hurt the credit assistant."

09:21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm ready to rock this when you guys are."

09:21:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, We'll be back in 7 minutes."

09:21:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Bringing Fringe 3 again. Evenia said she'd like to do the same setup as last night if you guys are cool with it."

09:21:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure."

09:22:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm fine with it."

09:22:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "We were ripping things last night."

09:23:21 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Evenia?"

09:25:01 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes?"

09:26:15 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Eli told me you might be able to help. At some point, I'll need a lift out to station foxtrot in the arm to retrieve my other ship. Otherwise, I will have to make that station my primary base of opperations. Is there any way you could give me a lift out there when it's convenient?"

09:26:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Where are you now?"

09:26:40 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Old earth."

09:26:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Okay. Give me a moment and I'll come get you now."

09:27:11 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Thanks a lot. I appreciate it."

09:28:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "This ship is gonna hurt like a bitch to upgrade. But I love her already."

09:29:14 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Sounds expensive, but worth it."

09:29:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "The hull. Was 750 million. On it's own."

09:30:42 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I see you."

09:50:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "All done. I'm collecting the gemini now."

09:50:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Eve, what planet is that Fringe casino on?"

09:50:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um...you're not talking about L5 station, are you?"

09:50:55 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No no, the Fringe one."

09:51:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um."

09:51:12 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The one with the lift."

09:51:24 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm potentially the worst person to ask. Since I don't really gamble. Unless it's against you. For tael."

09:51:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But you're a Fringer!"

09:51:49 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I am!"

09:53:25 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Wait, and it has a lift? I honestly don't have a clue."

09:53:47 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Where is this?"

09:53:50 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A gondola."

09:54:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Pretty sure it's a Fringe world, anyways."

09:54:26 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

11:32:21 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I think that beacon went down while we were clearing that nest."

11:32:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Which beacon?"

11:32:46 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "285."

11:33:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um...Maybe yell at Shule. I think."

11:33:57 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's for the best. I'm better off sleeping than staying up all night hauling."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:49:16 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

19:49:19 There appear to be about 12 pilots recently active.

20:12:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:12:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

20:12:34 You peer out...

20:12:34 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

20:12:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:12:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:12:40 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:12:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:12:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:12:54 The ship is already moving.

20:12:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:12:56 Which sector did you mean?

20:12:56 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)

20:12:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:12:59 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

20:13:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:13:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:13:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:13:05 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:13:10 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 030" has jumped out of the sector.

20:13:13 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

21:07:43  You are wearing a lightweight navy wool suit jacket, a long-sleeved white cotton dress shirt, a pair of pleated front slim fit navy wool dress pants, and a pair of black patent leather oxfords. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of black silk socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

21:07:43 You are carrying nothing.

21:07:44 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:07:52 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

21:07:54 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:07:55 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:07:55 You exit the ship.

21:07:56 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey is standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

21:08:02 You wave to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

21:08:04 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says to you, "Can I kidnap you for a brief time?"

21:08:09 You say, "Sure."

21:08:10 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

21:08:10 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

21:08:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes you into his group.

21:08:12 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:08:14 The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

21:08:14 You follow Rogue Pilot Eli Grey aboard the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul".
[Starship "Wandering Soul"; Airlock]
You see a stationary artifact repository drone and Sir Goldenpants the hefty red felo here.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:08:15 You follow Rogue Pilot Eli Grey into the ship.

21:08:15 [Starship "Wandering Soul"; Control Room]
You see a sapphire blue nylon-netted chair, a cardboard box labeled 'images', Orby the security hoverbot, and Gadget the humanoid service robot here.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey is standing here.
You can go south and out.

21:08:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from him.

21:08:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:08:20 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:08:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Wandering Soul, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:08:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:08:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:08:36 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:08:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Spinward Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:08:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Spinward Cluster."

21:08:42 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:08:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:08:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:08:45 Streams of stellar gases and glittering clusters of debris unfurl in every direction in nearby space.

21:08:47 Via general sector communication, Beacon A-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Wandering Soul.' Welcome to The Spinward Cluster."

21:08:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:08:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey ducks under the arm of Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident as he checks a nearby control panel.
(10 seconds roundtime.)

21:08:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Beacon A-02.

21:08:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:09:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:09:37 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:09:41 Automated flight control clears the ship to dock.

21:09:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:09:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:10:03 You follow Rogue Pilot Eli Grey out.

21:10:03 [Starship "Wandering Soul"; Airlock]
You see a stationary artifact repository drone and Sir Goldenpants the hefty red felo here.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:10:04 You follow Rogue Pilot Eli Grey out of the ship.

The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" is landed here.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey is standing here.
You can go up and down.

21:10:05 You follow Rogue Pilot Eli Grey down.

21:10:05 [Beacon A-02; Systems Room]
You see a sanitation drone here.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey is standing here.
You can go up and down.

21:10:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ok, sorry for all the secrecy, but we gotta be careful."

21:10:24 You say, "No problem. I understand."

21:10:31 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods down.

21:11:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "So, I've been talking to Shea a bit, and the negotiations are going well, unfortunately. They will be completed within the month."

21:11:30 You say, "Ugh."

21:11:31 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

21:11:32 You say, "Ok."

21:11:36 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

21:12:01 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Some of us would like to start an industry strike. You should still be able to do yourbeacons, but we'll have to not bring any resources at all."

21:12:08 You nod.

21:12:13 You say, "Ather told me about that."

21:12:25 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh good, I didn't nkow he'd been talking to you guys, excellent."

21:12:31 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods down.

21:12:31 You grin.

21:12:39 You ask, "Do you guys know when?"

21:12:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Did he tell you how we would like to start it?"

21:12:57 You ask, "By self-destructing our transports over New Earth?"

21:13:02 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gives an excited double thumbs up!

21:13:05 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey exclaims, "Fantastic!"

21:13:20 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ok wow yeah this saves time then. I guess I didn't even really need to bring you out here."

21:13:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cackles!

21:13:28 You ask, "Will we probably be rogued for this?"

21:13:31 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

21:14:10 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It's possible, though I think as long as there are several of us it will look worse on them to rogue everyone."

21:14:19 You nod.

21:14:31 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods down.

21:14:50 You ask, "So, when are you guys planning on starting it?"

21:14:54 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hell they might even try to aresst us. I would reccomend having a ride somewhere else, or directing your pod to somewhere like the Torus if you are going to participate in that part."

21:15:02 You nod.

21:15:05 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "But probably not just for the strike itself though."

21:15:08 You say, "I plan on it."

21:15:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'm hoping for the day after tomorrow. Thursday night."

21:15:30 You say, "Ok."

21:15:31 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

21:15:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Trying to get permission to bring the holocamera on board my transport. I'd like to time it so that it will pick up the transports exploding, before mine explodes as well."

21:15:56 You nod.

21:16:02 You say, "Makes sense."

21:16:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ok wow, this is better than I thought. For some reason I thought you might be harder to convince."

21:16:21 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

21:16:23 You grin.

21:16:31 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods down.

21:16:33 You say, "Lily will probably kill me, but oh well."

21:16:38 You chuckle.

21:16:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "We're not going to bring Vernos in just yet, just to be on the safe side, but he will obviously be welcome to join the strike."

21:16:53 You nod.

21:17:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "With any luck,  this whole thing will not last long, I'm sure they'll want to bring us back to working as soon as possible."

21:17:31 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

21:17:32 You say, "I should hope so."

21:17:36 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

21:18:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ok good deal then. We'll try to get together at Ther's house or something before the broadcast to make sure we've got the details hammered out. If you end up not being able to make it ti's fine, but at least joining the strike will be helpfull."

21:18:31 You say, "Just let me know the time somehow and I'll try to be there."

21:18:31 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods up.

21:18:32 You nod.

21:18:35 You say, "Cool."

21:18:43 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

21:19:04 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Alright, I'll get you back then, I'm so relieved you are on board."

21:19:08 You grin.

21:19:25 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "We're gonna show these pricks that they can't keep ignoring us."

21:19:30 You give an enthusiastic thumbs up.

21:19:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey exclaims, "Woo!"

21:19:36 You follow Rogue Pilot Eli Grey up.

21:19:46 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey begins the launch sequence.

21:19:51 The computer locates a launch trajectory.

21:19:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:20:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:20:07 "That was some funny graffiti on the housing, huh?" Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "I knew you'd want to see that in person."

21:20:11 You laugh.

21:20:13 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:20:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:20:14 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:20:17 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:20:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

21:20:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:20:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:20:20 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:20:21 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:20:25 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:20:28 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Wandering Soul! Welcome to home space!"

21:20:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey stands up.

21:20:30 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:20:30 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey accidentally slams his shoulder into Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident as he attempts to work with a nearby control panel.
(6 seconds roundtime.)

21:20:30 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:20:34 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Whoops, sorry."

21:20:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Wandering Soul. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:20:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:20:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:20:49 You wave.

21:20:51 You say, "Thanks."

21:20:51 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey waves.

21:20:52 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:21:12 Star Conquest Help: Rescue Pods
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Space is dangerous. With this in mind, the now-defunct Intersector Shipbuilding Company developed the rescue pod system. Rescue pods are partly memory metal, partly inflatable, and can deploy near-instantly in the midst of a starship losing structural integrity. Electromagnetic manipulators dedicated to the task will place all crew members swiftly into the pod.

In other words, if your starship is destroyed, you will find yourself in a rescue pod. Starships also additionally contain a single escape pod which can be deployed manually. If you wish to manually escape your ship, simply use the ESCAPE command. Note that this leaves your ship intact but empty; if you wish to destroy your ship, check the Self-Destruct help file.

Rescue pods are fully automated for your own safety. Using sublight autopilot, a built-in wormhole drive, and even a rift drive, your pod will transport you to your home port in the most efficient manner. Using the DESTINATION command, you can change your pod's destination to another alliance's port, as long as diplomatic relations allow you to land there.

If you are on the other side of the skim gate from your home port, you will probably very much want to use this DESTINATION command. Otherwise, your pod will spend hours crossing the space that the skim gate covers.
--

21:21:51 Your ship is loaded with nothing with any particular destination at the moment.

21:21:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:21:55 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:21:57 There appear to be about 12 pilots recently active.

21:22:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:23:09 The ship's current engine speed is 12000 km/s.

21:23:09 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 6.0 seconds.

21:23:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:23:15 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:23:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

22:06:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's more important is how many jumps you have left."

22:06:31 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yes I know, I was just wondering if it took charge like wormhole jumping does."

22:06:38 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "3."

22:06:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll need to jump a couple times to get back home."

22:06:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's a bit close. I'd land at a mutuality port for a recharge."

22:07:17 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "The closest mutuality port is 3 jumps, I don't know if I can make it. Let me check to see if I have a charge booster."

22:08:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would think you should be able to skim and jump to earthgate or something."

22:08:39 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But be quick about it."

22:08:41 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Good, I have a charge booster. I'll take the skim without life support, and if necessary use the charge booster. I'd rather land at earthgate then risk using up all my jumps and running out of power, because that might end badly."

22:10:08 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "There. I've got life support, damage control, and weapons offline. Powering up, and getting the hell out of here."

22:10:49 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Good, that saved me only 5 mins of charge though. I think I'll make it."

22:11:08 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It will be fine."

22:11:22 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Once you're back at gateway it will be trivial for someone to come get you, anyway."

22:11:23 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Ihope so."

22:11:40 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "That's th[ oth)r reason I'm skimming instead of going to a mutuality port."

22:11:54 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm c@tt\ng a<tific:al grav. Let~s see if{that saves me~e,en more char(e."

22:12:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hummingbird isn't currently available to help."

22:15:29 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "League."

22:19:02 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "It's good to be back. I'll need another charge booster though."

22:19:16 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I think I can get one in a starship supply store."

22:19:40 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You can. I always keep a couple on me, even now."

22:20:43 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Anyone doing beacons today?"

22:21:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not right now. I'm still in "Eve needs to wake up and power up." mode."
