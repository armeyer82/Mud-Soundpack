00:00:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, that's no problem."

00:01:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I won't be able to join you this time."

00:03:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im wondering if I could do a beacon on my own in a fighter."

00:05:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You definitely can."

00:06:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Start on a low or standard just to get a feel for it."

00:06:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say standards are two fighters and a corvette most of the time."

00:06:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say standards are two fighters and a corvette most of the time."

00:06:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And lows are just fighters usually."

00:06:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, might want to use a rental fighter though, they're little stronger than the ones you have access to currently."

00:06:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, that's a good point."

00:07:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can get rentals from Tannhauser Gate."

00:07:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know if you're aware, but one thing to worry about with beacons is getting chains attached to your ship."

00:07:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They limit your movement and prevent your escape if things go south."

00:07:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So be aware of that, and try to prioritize whatever is currently chaining you."

00:08:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll know when something does chain you, and you can see who it was if you forgot by hitting the 'scan' button and scanning the ships."

00:08:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The scans report who's chaining what."

00:10:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's also no shame in leaving for repairs if you have to."

00:11:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, and honestly if you get stuck, there's folks that would come save you, though it will attract more enemy ships if it comes to that."

00:13:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "On another note, How would I get started on the crafting stuff you mentioned, Eli?"

00:14:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Go out of the West exit of the spacesport, and then Head North a few blocks on Soviet. There's a craftsmen store there."

00:15:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It'll take a while before you have enough money to buy all the licenses though, so for the moment you'll be able to just make components probably, depending on what license you get first."

00:16:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's still nice to have the workbench though, that way you can start disassembling the stuff you are getting from beacons. Start collecting parts."

00:17:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm hoping that I'll eventually be able to build a robot servant who will pick up my collected scrap and go disassemble it."

00:17:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are there blueprints for robots like that?"

00:17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think so, as far as I know you have to disassemble things yourself. Though the service and arachnoid robots can craft simple things for you while you sleep or do other things."

00:17:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Very handy for making circuit boards, and things."

00:18:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

00:18:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Man, a disassembling robot would be so good."

00:18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So in summary,  no disassemble robots."

00:21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Does the workbench help you gather parts on only the ship you put it on?"

00:21:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can carry it around with you, and siassemble parts whereever."

00:22:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, the choices of liscening are interesting..Hm."

00:23:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I forget which one makes circuit boards."

00:23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That one is pretty good to start with."

00:23:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think."

00:23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's probably electronics."

00:23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that sounds right."

00:23:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Electronics makes circuit boards, but you also need plastic boards to make them and chemistry to make them into etched plastic boards."

00:24:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you want to be able to make things right away, your best bets are probably metals and plastics, then you'll at least be able to make some containers and starship decorations."

00:24:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I went with utility and electronics."

00:26:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I like utility and you can always ask others for parts if you want to make some of the stuff in there."

00:37:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Definetly going to have to buy nice clothes later."

00:40:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Vernos, if you get time, will you find out how much money the alliance gets from it's pilots doing Accord missions?"

00:42:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will certainly ask."

00:43:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They got a bit short with me over asking about reduced penalities for you guys."

00:44:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They always tend to be pretty short about everything, unless a longer response is warranted."

00:54:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Nah this short answer felt like them trying to take my soul."

01:01:09 There appear to be about 17 pilots recently active.

01:03:18 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]

01:03:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go up and out.

01:03:20 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:03:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:03:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:03:26 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

01:03:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Striking Distance, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:03:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:03:32 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Thanos" has landed on the planet New Earth.

01:03:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:03:39 Which sector did you mean?

01:03:41 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:03:41 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:03:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:03:45 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:03:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:03:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:03:48 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:03:56 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Striking Distance! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:03:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:04:34 The ship's current engine speed is 6857 km/s.

01:04:34 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 3.5 seconds.

01:04:37 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:04:37 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:04:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Striking Distance. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:04:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:04:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:04:52 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:04:53 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:04:53 You scramble to your feet.

01:05:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

01:05:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:05:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:05:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:05:23 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: 3xozZRh'g!G6"j<-m9{1VcM?,mD=S/vcM+BN%sF%
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:05:27 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

01:05:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.
A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

01:05:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:05:28 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:05:29 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

01:05:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:05:33 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:05:34 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

01:10:49 You knock calmly upon the hull of the one-person cargo hauler "Thanos".

01:13:16 The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 851" rises smoothly off the ground and accelerates rapidly toward space.

01:13:41 Tara Flores exits from the one-person cargo hauler "Thanos".

01:13:44 You grin at Tara Flores.

01:13:47 You wave to Tara Flores.

01:13:57 Tara Flores waves to you "Hiya. How's it going?"

01:14:03 You say to Tara, "Try to keep your ship powered down on the landing pad."

01:14:07 You say, "Please."

01:14:17 You say, "It's going well. Thanks."

01:14:19 You grin.

01:15:08 Tara says to you, "Oh, I was just waiting for repairs. That Warship destroyed my turrets."

01:15:13 You say, "Ah, ok."

01:15:15 You grin.

01:15:19 You say, "No worries then."

01:15:26 You smile at Tara Flores.

01:15:28 Tara Flores says, "Im off to start salvaging some more."

01:15:34 You exclaim, "Awesome!"

01:15:39 Tara Flores exclaims, "See you!"

01:15:42 You say, "See ya."

01:15:44 Some lights on the one-person cargo hauler "Thanos" flash as Tara Flores boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

01:15:45 I don't see that here.

01:15:46 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

01:15:46 You can go up.

You can go south, up, and out.

01:15:52 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

01:19:15 [MTTS] usfolks: Since you guys closed it...one more question. Does that mean things carry over from one location to another? There's so much of what was said to me in those supports that I doubt few if any know. I certainly didn't.

01:20:19 [MTTS] Squidmind: They can. Trade items are trade items. They're likely to have value anywhere trading occurs.

01:20:44 [MTTS] usfolks: Could you guys possibly add some of that to the trading help file? Because I seriously doubt that's well-known and probably should be.

01:21:47 [MTTS] alc_71: It's been done before. Some give up and others don't but yeah, probably isn't well known.

01:22:21 [MTTS] usfolks: Well I had no idea...and didn't get a response to my support in time to not do what I did. It really would have been nice to know.

01:22:22 [MTTS] Butchulla: I didn't know that. So a trade item can be taken to another trading location, and traded?

01:23:59 [MTTS] Squidmind: Of course. If it has value at one place, it'll have value elsewhere.

01:25:01 [MTTS] usfolks: I suppose when two hours later there was still no one for it, and I tried for the better part of an hour after that, there was no way I could know that an intermediate item could be used to begin a chain elsewhere. So if we don't know...there's no way we can do anything about it.

01:26:23 [MTTS] usfolks: Anyway, what's done is done, all I'm asking is that something like that be added to the trading help file so others don't do what I did just plain not knowing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

05:45:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Eh, shes probably busy with orientation or something."

05:45:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that makes sense."

05:45:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, if she's got a good of head on her shoulders as you do, we'll be in good shape."

05:47:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "We butt heads a lot but she'll do good, im sure of it.. im suprised that she did make the decision to be a pilot though."

05:48:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, if you two are close, maybe she just idn't want to be away from her sister. It can be hard on folks who still have family that they can't go visit without special approval."

05:49:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, right. You guys can't hear me shrug."

05:49:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Huh? We can't?"

05:49:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, not without occasional planetary visitation passes."

05:50:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Unless they live in an already approved city, like New Phoenix."

05:50:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Depending on where you lived, the alliance won't le tyou revisit that area except by special request. It's cause of all the credits that we make. We stand to do a lot of single-handed damage to any city's economy if we were able to just go anywhere we pleased."

05:50:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "People like Ather crash economies just by getting off the hoverbus."

05:51:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well ok, me too. And you too one day."

05:51:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There's Jack town too, don't forget jachey, I only have 37 billion credits and change. Why don't you fucking ask someone like Lily how many credits they have?"

05:51:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Lily has more credits than you? Damn."

05:52:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily has like 5 times the credits I have."

05:52:31 [General Communication] Eli transmits the sound of coughing and spluttering.

05:52:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But don't forget, Lily hasn't lost like 8 cruisers in defense of the alliance. Shitload of pulsars, fucking goodness knows how many smaller ships."

05:53:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I hit the wrong button.. oh my god."

05:53:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And almost literally all she does is like mine and shit."

05:53:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I have...."

05:53:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "1 credit?"

05:53:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thirty four million?"

05:53:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's insane, I bet your net worth is more though."

05:53:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep, 1 credit."

05:53:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's 34 million in like what, two days?"

05:53:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, she's still got me on networth. Especially since my house isn't counted towards it yet."

05:54:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not to mention how much you've probably spent."

05:54:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I also spent 25 million earlier, Eli."

05:54:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, Ather I was thinking of your house."

05:54:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like I said, Eli. She doesn't spend a vast majority of he rcredits. She rarely to never flies major beacon drops and the like that I've seen. Heck, I don't ever think I've seen her pilot in y life."

05:55:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I spent 25 million on...breakfast!"

05:55:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa assaults your ears with a burst of static and screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs, "HA, HA! IS JOKE!"

05:55:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep.. I've said it hundred times, my dad would have a fit if he knew how many credits I just toss around on a whim."

05:55:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Laugh right now."

05:56:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What? I can't hear anything now, it's just all ringing."

05:56:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Laugh or I'll beat you with my baton."

05:56:34 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station in Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285.

05:56:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Beat you with a baton? Why would you want me to beat you with a baton."

05:56:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "OK that does it."

05:57:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

05:57:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aha, I escaped1."

05:57:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "Ok, Ok, shit."

05:58:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Better."

05:58:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Call off your clipper."

05:59:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Man, I should have really run, that might have been fun."

05:59:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And possibly good practice?"

06:00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Probably!"

06:01:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn't even realize I was on the pad."

06:01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You weren't."

06:02:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok. Just that robot intuition, huh?"

06:02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I took an educated guess, transported the right ship because I figured I know you so well, and my gamble paid off. I'm not really that new at the game of careful tactical thinking, you know."

06:02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

06:03:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Everyone has their routines. Observe long enough, and you can eventulaly unravel everything!"

06:03:33 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I always forget about ha ha, is joke."

06:03:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh stupid comms button."

06:03:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sigh eli 'go to bed."

06:03:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just go to bed."

06:04:40 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Pay no attention to the fomorian, you have heard nothing."

06:11:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well. Time to tear apart more dead bari spreaders. Ugh."

06:11:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww, tara, we didn't scare off your sister, did we?"

06:12:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nah, probably not!"

06:15:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey Ather? What the hell is this switch that toggles off sensor interpretations?"

06:16:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sensor interpretations?"

06:16:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."

06:16:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, the switch is just labled reports, but that's apparently what it does. But I honestly have no idea what that actually means."

06:18:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's a toggle and it says "report sensor interpretations."

06:22:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, it would help if he was still on comms."

08:36:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh cool! She's just as awesome, I'm sure."

08:37:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're gonna have a sibling rivalry, right here in the corps."

08:37:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That might be just what we've been missing."

08:44:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Here I thought it was just we needed someone to shake things up."

08:45:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's definitely good to get some new pilots. I feel like we've been in a major dry spell."

08:50:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone sighs.

12:50:07 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:50:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", a wormhole drive tracer, and Shule Elemmire's workbench here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:36:41 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:36:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:36:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:36:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:36:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:37:00 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:37:00 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:37:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:37:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:37:23 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

15:37:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:37:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:37:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:37:29 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: `pq=-L!r(*co$urr]9V}ncH}SWj/feZ2b2OF[(Zx

15:37:35 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:37:36 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

15:37:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:37:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:37:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:37:39 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:37:40 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

15:43:52 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:43:52 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

15:56:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

15:57:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:57:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Finally got access to a grade thirty grapple, so i've been making decent credits salvaging."

15:57:22 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:57:22 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:57:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire cheers for Tara Flores!

15:57:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:57:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:57:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:57:40 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:57:40 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:57:42 There appear to be about 11 pilots recently active.

18:09:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or do I need to go pick it up on the pad?"

18:09:38 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Didn't try before."

18:10:35 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm guessing since I ended up saying New Earth, that'll it have to be on the pad."

18:11:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though sometimes I have a hard time pronouncing the name of the apartments I live in."

18:11:02 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I think so, bcause they don't know your apartment."

18:14:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, should have just gotten colt's like Iusually do, no need to get wormholes involved in this."

You can go south and out.

18:25:17 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:25:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:25:20 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:25:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

18:25:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:25:33 The ship is already moving.

18:25:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:25:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:25:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:25:37 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

18:25:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:25:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:25:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:25:44 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:25:45 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

18:27:54 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

18:27:55 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

19:02:42 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nothing that can be done about it. Can't be dodged."

19:02:43 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

19:02:49 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

Rogue Pilot Eli Grey is standing here.
You can go west.

19:03:33 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a sip of a foam cup of steaming hot coffee.

19:03:39 You say, "Guess beacocns are off for now."

19:03:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

19:03:43 You say, "Er, beacons."

19:03:46 You grin.

19:03:51 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "You mean bescons?"

19:03:53 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snickers.

19:03:56 You chuckle.

19:03:59 You say, "Yeah, those too."

19:04:02 You laugh.

19:04:04 Tara Flores walks in from the west.

19:04:06 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I couldn't help but laugh when I saw that on Vernos' first notice."

19:04:10 You laugh.

19:04:12 You say, "Yeah."

19:04:20 You say to Tara Flores, "Beacons are off for now."

19:04:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smiles at Tara Flores.

19:04:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

19:04:25 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey finishes off a foam cup of steaming hot coffee.

19:04:25 You say, "Thanks all for coming."

19:04:29 Tara Flores exclaims, "To Shule Oh, Alright!"

19:04:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gives you a thumbs up!

19:04:30 You grin.

19:04:43 Tara Flores says, "I'm gona have to grab my sister for the next one."

19:04:47 You cheer.

19:04:52 You say to Tara, "Is she cute?"

19:04:56 You chuckle.

19:05:02 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Use a dash or a ` in front of someone's name to speak directly to them."

19:05:09 Tara says to you, "She's the ugly one!"

19:05:14 You grin at Tara Flores.

19:05:14 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles at Tara Flores.

19:05:17 You chuckle.

19:05:25 You say, "I'll be sure not to tell her you said that."

19:05:28 Eli says to Tara, "I don't know.. I kinda have a thing for th eredheads."

19:05:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snickers.

19:05:37 You chuckle at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

19:05:44 Tara snickers, clearly joking. "It might be hard to believe we're sisters or not at first sight. We look fairly different."

19:05:47 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "That's about all I saw of her though. Just a flitting of red hair as she passed."

19:05:59 You grin.

19:06:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "She's the milkman's daughter?"

19:06:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snickers.

19:06:14 I don't understand that.

19:06:15 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ok, that was bad. Sorry."

19:06:16 You chuckle.

19:06:23 You poke Rogue Pilot Eli Grey in the ribs!

19:06:36 You chuckle at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "Be nice."

19:06:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "What the hell is a milkman anywas?"

19:06:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Anyways."

19:06:50 You say, "Yeah, was going to ask."

19:07:02 You say, "A man with milk? Umm, that sounds weird."

19:07:05 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I never quite understood that saying, something I heard in an old holo once."

19:07:10 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey looks at you and shrugs.

19:07:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Maybe he's made out of milk?"

19:07:26 You say, "Maybe."

19:07:35 Tara Flores gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

19:07:38 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I've seen stranger things."

19:07:45 You nod. "For sure."

19:08:06 Tara Flores says, "Looking forward to when Im an offical pilot, and not a cadet."

19:08:14 You grin at Tara Flores. "I bet."

19:08:15 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Tara Flores.

19:08:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

19:08:33 Tara Flores says, "I'm saving up the credits I earn for then, to buy some ships and upgrades."

19:08:34 You say, "I thankfully was a cadet for only about two weeks at the most."

19:08:46 You nod to Tara Flores.

19:08:49 You say, "Good idea."

19:08:53 Eli says to Tara, "Not that you are not rocking that plain gray shipsuit, but you should probably go shopping too."

19:08:56 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

19:08:59 You grin.

19:09:07 You say, "Just uhhh, don't do what Lily did."

19:09:14 Tara Flores asks, "What did Lily do?"

19:09:26 You say, "Dropped her suit before she went shopping."

19:09:52 Tara burst out laughing "Oh goodness. That couldn't have gone well."

19:09:55 You say, "It's uhh, a bit more fragile than you'd expect."

19:09:59 You say, "Yeah."

19:10:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

19:10:49 You say, "Not much more embarrassing than running to the nearest store in your underwear."

19:11:26 You say to Tara, "And don't tell her I told you that story."

19:11:36 You say, "I won't live through the night."

19:11:36 Tara Flores asks, "What story?"

19:11:39 You grin.

19:11:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey suddenly awakens.

19:11:52 You give Rogue Pilot Eli Grey a thumbs up!

19:12:00 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Erm.. sorryI spaced out for a second, What did Lily do?"

19:12:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Did I pass out?"

19:12:09 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

19:12:15 You say, "Drofpped her suit before she went shopping."

19:12:19 You say, "Erm, her."

19:12:21 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey blinks at you.

19:12:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chortles.

19:12:26 You laugh.

19:12:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "So she was just.. running around naked?"

19:12:50 You say, "So, she had to run to the nearest clothing store through the space port in her underwear and bra."

19:12:54 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "That's awesome, did she get aressted?"

19:12:55 You laugh.

19:12:57 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh ok."

19:12:59 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

19:13:02 You say, "Nope."

19:13:26 You say, "And if either of you tell her I told you that story, I'll hang you up by your toenails."

19:13:30 Tara Flores says, "I've just been having trouble of thinking of what to buy for clothes, really. I'll figure something out."

19:13:31 You grin.

19:13:33 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cackles!

19:13:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

19:13:52 You nod and grin at Tara Flores.

19:13:53 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'll tell her that constantine told me."

19:13:57 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snickers.

19:14:00 You chuckle.

19:14:14 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well, I suppose I should vacate your gunnery station."

19:14:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey waves frantically!

19:14:34 You say, "Well, I do need to doze soon."

19:14:35 You wave to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

19:14:39 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to you.

19:14:41 Tara Flores nods.

19:14:45 Tara says to you, "See you later!"

19:14:48 Tara Flores waves.

19:14:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey walks west.

19:14:50 Orby the security hoverbot floats after Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.
Tara Flores walks west.

19:14:51 I don't see that here.

19:14:53 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Weapons Room Two]

19:14:53 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Please only use lasers unless otherwise directed. Thank you." and an overstuffed red chair here.
You can go west.

19:14:59 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Corridor]

19:14:59 You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "One pile from storage per pilot. Thank you." here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

19:15:02 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

19:15:02 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, and a black leather sofa here.
You can go south and out.

19:15:09 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire.

19:15:09 Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

19:15:12 Not ejected.

19:15:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "See you guys later."

19:15:24 You blink heavily and then doze off.

19:15:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Fourty one million saved up so far."

19:16:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Woo!"

19:16:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Already got your debts paid off?"

19:17:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yup."

19:17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Fantastic."

19:18:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey! Luja!"

19:18:20 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Hello!"

19:19:20 [MTTS] Ulias: Did you guys do away with the regular citizen player system?

19:19:27 [MTTS] Ulias: Or do just folks never use that.

19:20:27 [MTTS] Squidmind: We eventually discontinued it due to the amount of effort each individual non-pilot required, combined with the fact that every non-pilot rerolled extremely quickly due to not being able to engage with the game to the same level as standard pilot players.

19:21:21 [MTTS] Ulias: Ah, yeah that makes sense I suppose. I'm not sure I could have done it myself, but it always seemed like a good option for hardcore roleplayers.

19:22:12 [MTTS] Squidmind: I think we had maybe six or seven non-pilots while the option was available?  A couple of them did pretty well, but you could see them gradually get disheartened with all the 'anyone want to do a beacon?'  "I'd love to, but..." and having to ask for lifts to get to other planets.

19:22:35 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "What's an artifact repository drone for~CB~8B."

19:22:54 [MTTS] Ulias: Would have been kinda neat if we could have had one of each, but that would have clearly lead to meta shenanigans.

19:23:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can bolt it, and put a xenology container inside. Then when you drop an artifact, it will automatically place it into the container for you."

19:23:32 [MTTS] usfolks: I can so see that as a disaster waiting to happen.

19:23:46 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Ah, I see."

19:23:56 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I don't see a point."

19:24:04 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Me neither."

19:24:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's only a mild time-saver, but I've always really liked mine."

19:24:16 [MTTS] Squidmind: If we had unlimited time and energy to create stuff for a non-pilot, sure.  But each non-pilot was basically a permanent never-ending policy 14 event for that person, which was the second major reason we discontinued it.  We had to put a lot of effort into building, coding, and fluff, in order to have a non-pilot function in any usable way.

19:24:35 [MTTS] Ulias: Oh yeah, wow. I didn't think about that.

19:24:46 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "It would be cooler if he go pick them from spae."

19:24:50 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

19:24:51 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Space?"

19:25:01 [General Communication] Alko Delovega laughs.

19:25:42 [MTTS] usfolks: When I was new, I thought most of the staff-played NPC's were special application non-pilot characters. Gotta love the naivete of new players.

19:25:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've never tested it, but I've often wondered if you can put different containers in them, and have it seperate them into the proper containers based on who is dropping it, that might be kinda nice. Though the times when two people need to deposit an artifact at the same time are basically non-existant as far as I know."

19:26:57 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I don't see anything wrong with the way we are doing it now, not even slow."

19:26:59 [MTTS] Squidmind: I'm not sure whether we should take that as a compliment or not.

19:27:15 [MTTS] Ulias: Hahaha.

19:27:40 [MTTS] usfolks: Heh. It was not meant in a negative way at all. Just my total lack of knowledge when I started playing.

19:28:23 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Someone has to go with me GMG!"

19:28:26 [MTTS] Ulias: I love interacting with NPC's It's one of the things that sets SC apart from everything else in my opinion. Writing letters and all that, if they don't get responded to. It's a level that won't be achieved in regular games until they create Diamond Age style games, with dedicated actors.

19:28:40 [MTTS] Ulias: Even if they don't get responded to, rather.

19:29:03 [MTTS] Squidmind: Keep in mind that it's easy for us to miss letters, so if you want to ensure we notice, a support ticket is useful.

19:31:51 [MTTS] Ulias: I can't just tell the liaison? Aren't they mailmen?

19:31:56 [MTTS] Ulias: Hehehe.

19:32:35 [MTTS] Squidmind: You can tell the Voice if you like. I'm sure none of them have any other pressing issues right now!

19:32:57 [MTTS] Ulias: I'll keep that in mind though, I just always thought of it as I'm writing someone who is very busy and doesn't have time to respond to every letter that's sent by a civilian pilot asking about quotes and advice.

19:33:06 [MTTS] usfolks: Gee...I'm trying to keep the house quiet and about busted out laughing. good one.

19:33:21 [MTTS] usfolks: Me too Ulias.

19:33:21 [MTTS] Squidmind: That's a good reason, but that also applies to us OOCly as well!

19:34:04 [MTTS] Squidmind: Well, less 'doesn't have time to' and more 'is busy and will miss them', since we don't get the benefit of a physical thing being dumped on a desk.

19:34:10 [MTTS] usfolks: You mean...the Squidmind has a life? Or...lives? Tell me it ain't so!

19:34:23 [MTTS] Squidmind: The Squidmind is eternal.

19:34:30 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, I can imagine it would be a pain to check every NPc's mailbox, there's a ton of them.

19:34:55 [MTTS] Ulias: Even with some system that dumps them all together, it's probably a lot.

19:34:59 [MTTS] usfolks: I meant a life outside of SC. And that does clear something up for me. I kind of figured you got mail notifications or something, but it makes sense you don't.

19:35:23 [MTTS] usfolks: That they'd all end up in a bin in the host lounge or something.

19:35:36 [MTTS] Squidmind: We do have things that simplify it, but you're correct that there are a LOT of NPCs.

19:36:22 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah. I'll have to remember the support thing next time. I kind of did that once...but probably should have included the letter or something. It still went well though. You guys do awesome things.

19:40:00 [MTTS] Squidmind: There are approximately 200 NPCs. That may not cover all of them, either.

19:41:31 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, that's a lot to keep track of. Now...let me get that NPC's list and write unique letters to every single one just because...no don't hurt me I'm joking.

19:41:44 [MTTS] usfolks: Heh.

19:43:31 [MTTS] Ulias: Good lord, 200? That's even more than I imagined, certainly more than the help files suggest, though I'm sure this is because many of them don't have mailboxes.

19:44:01 [MTTS] Ulias: What do you mean I can't send a letter to Granny Tang?

19:44:27 [MTTS] usfolks: Oh lord, that probably means you tried...

19:44:47 [MTTS] Ulias: No I actually didn't, though I have tried ones like that before.

19:45:04 [MTTS] usfolks: Aha.

19:45:24 [MTTS] Squidmind: Every NPC that exists as an entity has a mailbox.  That 200 are only the ones who actually exist in-game as characters.

19:45:41 [MTTS] Squidmind: God knows how many 'NPCs' we've named who DON'T have characters.

19:46:03 [MTTS] Ulias: Oh wow, so was totally wrong about that. That's awesome.

19:46:15 [MTTS] usfolks: I'm sure that would multiply it several times at least.

19:47:10 [MTTS] Ulias: Didn't I hear you guys say once, that ships like pirate ships actually have NPC's in them crewing?

19:47:27 [MTTS] Ulias: Always thought that was a wicked concept.

19:47:45 [MTTS] Squidmind: Sort of, but they're not characters if that's what you mean.

19:48:17 [MTTS] usfolks: Are they similar to the automated NPC's like the cadet orientation officers and things?

19:48:20 [MTTS] Ulias: No no, Ijust meant that the ships are not empty.

19:48:29 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, like what they said.

19:48:36 [MTTS] Squidmind: They're entities that exist, yes.  They're just not named.

19:48:46 [MTTS] usfolks: A pilot, a gunner...

19:48:53 [MTTS] Ulias: That's so cool.

19:48:59 [MTTS] usfolks: It is.

19:49:23 [MTTS] Squidmind: Of course that's only for the generic AI ships, in some cases they are manned by NPCs.

19:49:43 [MTTS] usfolks: Well that would make sense. And would be how some of the plotlines have been possible.

19:50:05 [MTTS] Squidmind: Plotlines? In our game? I'LL PUT A STOP TO THAT!

19:50:13 [MTTS] usfolks: Please don't!

19:50:36 [MTTS] usfolks: That's one of the things that makes SC special. You don't just do invasions as events...there are actual plotlines.

19:50:57 [MTTS] Squidmind: Now there's an idea.  A weekly massive invasion instead of plots.  That'd make things much easier.  Thanks for the suggestion!

19:51:13 [MTTS] usfolks: Oh lord...

19:51:29 [MTTS] Ulias: Specifically host run plotlines, and not just player created ones. So many of these text based RPG's depend on their players to do almost everything.

19:52:12 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah...only staff involvement you get is invasions where players are required to participate.

19:52:20 [MTTS] Squidmind: We like when players do things, too.  We just want them to let us know they're doing it, because like with the mail thing we don't always catch stuff.

19:52:24 [MTTS] Ulias: I'm particularly a big fan of outside interference evetns. Random game spicer-upper? Toggle on please.

19:52:50 [MTTS] usfolks: Understandable. And yeah, me too Ulias. It was one of the first things I did in my character's settings.

19:54:15 [MTTS] usfolks: Those have been some of my most treasured times in this game...when random things just happen out of the blue.

19:55:02 [MTTS] Squidmind: Ha ha... blue!

19:55:06 [MTTS] Squidmind: Oh wait, wrong person.

19:56:04 [MTTS] usfolks: Heh. Heh. Heh.

20:01:46 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

20:01:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, and a black leather sofa here.
You can go south and out.

20:54:14 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

20:54:17 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

20:54:17 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Constantine Stone and Tara Flores are sitting on a slim and fashionable couch.
You can go out.

20:54:18 Constantine Stone asks, "How did your parents take that?"

20:54:21 You wave.

20:54:23 Constantine Stone waves.

20:54:26 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Hey!"

20:54:29 Constantine Stone takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

20:54:33 You say, "Hey."

20:54:36 You sit down on a slim and fashionable couch.

20:54:58 Tara says to Constantine, "Probably not well. I didn't expect my sister to do so."

20:55:06 Constantine Stone nods.

20:55:15 Constantine Stone says, "Still, it's nice to get to see her whenever you want."

20:55:22 Constantine Stone says, "It's tough to go visit family."

20:55:33 Tara Flores says, "We.. don't really get along."

20:55:34 Tara Flores shrugs.

20:55:37 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I see."

20:55:39 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Windflight" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

20:55:42 Tara Flores exclaims, "Most of the time, anyway!"

20:55:46 Constantine Stone nods.

20:56:07 You ask, "Who's ship is that that just landed?"

20:56:26 Constantine Stone says, "I think it must be Saira's."

20:56:29 Constantine Stone says, "Though I'm not sure."

20:56:33 You say, "Ah, ok."

20:56:37 You peer out...

20:56:38 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The two-person Accord gemini "Wayfarer", the one-person cargo hauler "Autumn Fracture", the one-person cargo hauler "Windflight", and the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 834" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.

20:57:08 You knock calmly upon the hull of the one-person cargo hauler "Windflight".

20:57:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Anyone up for vent cleaning?"

20:58:22 You pound impatiently on the hull of the one-person cargo hauler "Windflight".

20:58:29 You cannot transport a ship that is powered up.

20:58:40 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Edmund Fitzgerald". The organization has earned 2,775,401.30 credits.

20:59:12 The two-person Accord gemini "Wayfarer" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

20:59:18 The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 834" rises smoothly off the ground and accelerates rapidly toward space.

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:03:14 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:03:14 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:03:14 Board what?

21:03:15 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:03:16 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:03:16 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:03:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:03:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:03:24 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

21:03:27 The ship is already moving.

21:03:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:03:33 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:03:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:03:34 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

21:03:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:03:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:03:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:03:40 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

21:30:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true -- your AEU suit will upgrade tiers the fastest, but the other ones are still perfectly fine."

21:30:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "I suppose I wouldn't know for myself yet. I just purchased our model for my task."

21:30:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think for doing space vermin jobs and low deployments, the AEU suit is pretty great."

21:30:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That's fine, but don't be afraid to experiment with other types."

21:30:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The rental might be good too, but I've never owned a rental."

21:31:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "They just have different roles and abilities."

21:31:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The AEU suit repairs well, the fringe suit deals damage well."

21:31:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Fringtra 1 The league suit is aslo the lead suit."

21:32:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oops."

21:32:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "The league suit is also the lead suit."

21:32:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "When on a nest or whatever, you should always do what the league suit says to do."

21:33:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Nest."

21:33:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, one thing we do is clear out RATs nests."

21:33:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "All right, there is a lot to take in here."

21:33:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Like Constantine said, Fringe is a damage suit. The AEU suit repairs and also can be used to stun or interrupt the enemy."

21:33:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

21:34:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are also some other suits that sort of combine roles, but those are the three basic ones."

21:34:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, we should do a class."

21:34:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah we should!"

21:34:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But we lost our GSL."

21:34:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know I would benefit from that."

21:34:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.

21:35:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I kind of want to try the EAOS suits out."

21:35:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes! Grab one of those and we're halfway to a vent crew!"

21:37:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It'd only be the most basic light model."

21:37:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be fine for vents."

21:37:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Vernos, what suits do you have?"

21:39:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh my suit is still at SVP."

21:39:33 There appear to be about 16 pilots recently active.

21:43:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Is there a button inside this suit that will repair it? Or must I simply wait?"

21:44:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They do repair themselves slowly over time."

21:44:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But very slowly."

21:44:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Which suit do you have?"

21:44:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "AEU."

21:44:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "You'll want to get the minidrone Module when you can if you have the AEU suit. It can repair."

21:44:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, what Tara said. Don't put armor on it."

21:44:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Ah, I see. Thank you."

21:44:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You should have a weapon and the minidrones."

21:45:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:46:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And never, ever, put armor on an AEU suit."

21:46:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits quietly, "All right."

21:46:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How badly does it mess up repairs?"

21:46:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "A lot. It's terrible."

21:48:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I've seen an AEU suit repair more with a minor repair than the league suit with armor that used a major repair."

21:48:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting. I was about to ask if armor did that to every suit's repair capabilities."

21:48:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That makes sense."

21:49:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, it does. Armor inhibits minidrones."

21:49:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "If they're on the same suit. Regardless of the suit."

21:51:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Right, switched to EAOS model."

21:51:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Woo! Fun!"

21:51:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

21:51:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just bought a league suit."

21:52:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I can lead us on an adventure."

21:52:14 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hiya nonfringies."

21:52:22 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Lex."

21:52:25 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi."

21:52:35 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hello!"

21:52:37 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Hello."

21:52:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ather always recomended at least a tier 3 league for Old Frontier."

21:52:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Recommended."

21:52:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Uh oh. Well, do you want to lead it?"

21:53:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mine isn't that strong."

21:53:15 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hi pilots. Critters. Robots. And half-robot pilots."

21:53:20 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Anyone know if the inserter at orion has been set back up?"

21:53:27 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "EVE!"

21:53:40 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ahh it's tentacle pilot."

21:54:03 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And no, it has not."

21:54:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What we could do though, is a nest. If we could get Lex we'd have enough damage, and Saira, you could bring your repair suit."

21:54:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Uh...the orion station is up, I built it 3 days ago."

21:54:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Good enough."

21:54:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "It wasn't this morning."

21:54:40 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I tried to use it and kept getting told that I couldn't get there from here."

21:54:45 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Are you sure you were in the belt of orion and not the shoulder?"

21:55:00 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I checked it. The accelerators are there but no inserter."

21:55:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "There's no way it just ran off."

21:55:08 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yes cause I had just transferred to the nuclear reclamation out there."

21:55:13 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Someone ate it."

21:55:23 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Wait, no inserter? We put an inserter."

21:55:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "There is definitely an inserter...The hell? I built the thing with one."

21:55:45 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well I can tell you where to stick your inserter, but you'll have to find ti first."

21:55:45 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "There isn't one out at Belt of Orion."

21:56:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh wait, wait wait...I just had a thought. is the 285 station up?"

21:56:22 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hell if I know, I couldn't go there to find out."

21:56:37 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:56:38 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked. A small light near the hatch is dark and unpowered.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:56:39 I don't understand that.

21:56:40 I don't understand that.

21:56:41 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:56:41 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:56:42 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "It's possible it's at the other end, but wouldn't that mean you couldn't come back, not that you couldn't go there at all?"

21:56:42 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:56:42 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:56:43 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:56:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:56:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:56:56 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "If there's no beacon, it can't send &ou there."

21:56:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:56:59 Which sector did you mean?

21:57:00 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

21:57:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:57:01 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:57:02 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

21:57:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:57:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:57:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:57:08 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: 6is]|^\YQ@qCzO2/-A!8e4E_efxuZ~)>Ye-|m/O&
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:57:09 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

21:57:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:57:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:57:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:57:13 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well easy way to sort this."

21:57:14 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

21:57:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Because if the 285 accelerator is down...that could cause issues. accept that I wasn't given that to build, and I can't use a constructor, even if I was. It's probably on the seekers ship."

21:57:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:57:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:57:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:57:18 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:57:19 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

21:57:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:57:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:57:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:57:26 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2203 light-minutes per second from Galactic Eastnortheast and Slightly Up."

21:57:26 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

21:57:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Morris built a new one not like 2 days ago."

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:57:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station.

21:57:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:57:50 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "To take the place of the one that was going to go down. I've seen it cause he changed the message."

21:58:09 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Hmm."

21:58:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:58:19 You begin the docking sequence.

21:58:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

21:58:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "I could. It's just a little one though, and I've not yet gotten minidrones on it."

21:58:27 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In any case if someone goes out there to check I suggest taking a gunner or two just in case something nefarious happened."

21:58:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:58:39 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Not a bad plan."

21:58:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:58:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:58:42 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:58:43 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:58:43 You exit the ship.
[League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station; Docking Bay]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is parked here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

21:58:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Give me a minute to get dressed. And I'll sort this once and for all. I'll go check the range office. See what I can see."

21:58:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:58:55 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:58:56 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:58:56 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:59:14 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm docked at the accelerator in Belt of Orion. There is no inserter here."

21:59:22 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:59:23 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:59:23 You exit the ship.

Main Accelerator: 0.0, 20.0 (plus reverse)
Secondary:        225.0, 78.0 (plus reverse)

Rift accelerator links found: Home Beacon Alpha 286, Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285, and Artifact Beacon Beta 287

All rift accelerators have already been aligned. They cannot be realigned.

21:59:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And...even if the message was changed, that doesn't mean he built another. You can change those messages."

21:59:51 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "He specifically said he was building a new accelerator I thought Evenia, I could be wrong, I often am, but."

21:59:55 The computer reports that the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" has jumped into the sector.

21:59:57 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2208 light-minutes per second from Galactic Eastnortheast and Slightly Up."

22:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:00:10 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And it can find the the beacons out at 275, 285, and 287."

22:00:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "What the fuck. This is super damn strange. I built it with one. A boosted one at that."

22:00:19 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "286."

22:00:41 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's it forget 285, we'll all go to nuveau quebec."

22:01:03 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire cheers.

22:01:28 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh in that case. I'll just take a ship out there. I know the heading for NQ."

22:01:32 [League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station; Docking Bay]

22:01:33 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is parked here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

22:01:35 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok i'm available to go gun if someone wants to go look at the other end, but I think we should check this end first."

22:02:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Same here. Let's grab a cruiser so we can pile everyone aboard."

22:02:16 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wait, what's happening? Do we suspect foul play?"

22:02:28 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I do, but I"m paranoid."

22:02:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well I'll come with if you need cruiser crew."

22:02:44 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I have a cruiser with a rift drive!"

22:02:47 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

22:02:56 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I don't mind helping either."

22:02:57 The two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

22:03:00 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "But we had an IFS and an outsider incursion in fringe space, and I"m wondering if this isn't a next step."

22:03:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm not awake enough yet to suspect anything but where the hell my coffee is."

22:03:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In your belly from yesterday."

22:03:28 Lexie Amarras exits from the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit".

22:03:32 You wave to Lexie Amarras.

22:03:35 You exclaim, "Hi!"

22:03:39 Lexie Amarras says, "Hiiya and stuff."

22:03:48 Lexie Amarras says, "Something's fishy about all this."

22:03:49 You grin.

22:03:54 You nod.

22:04:00 Lexie Amarras says, "I don't believe either of the normal suspects is that dotty."

22:04:03 You say, "I told you not to eat the inserter."

22:04:06 You chuckle.

22:04:06 Lexie Amarras grins.

22:04:14 Lexie Amarras says, "But it was crunchy and it made my insides feel so far away."

22:04:19 You laugh.

22:04:37 Lexie Amarras hums a quiet tune.

22:04:41 You grin.

22:04:44 You say, "Bad Lexie."

22:04:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'll tag along."

22:05:02 Lexie Amarras says, "Think the next step is to get one of the fixers out here, convince them we're not barking up a tree, then take your cruiser out to the toher end."

22:05:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hang on. We're figuring it out. Two things we're talking about two different things."

22:05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh sorry con! I didn't see you there."

22:05:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:05:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's okay."

22:05:24 You nod to Lexie Amarras.

22:05:41 You say, "I'm sure Eve will be here in a minute."

22:05:50 You say, "But we really should go to NQ."

22:05:59 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I still say we go to NQ."

22:06:05 Lexie Amarras says, "Cause... If I were an outsider the first thing I'd do is test defense, then strike at economic bases then really pile in."

22:06:21 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:06:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Do they have benyees? I'd go for benyees?"

22:06:36 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:06:36 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Damned french pronunciation. Those square doughnuts."

22:06:57 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

22:07:02 Lexie Amarras grins at you.

22:07:15 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Nah, they just have lots of naked people. I mean... erm, never mind."

22:07:26 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Darnit now I want an apple fritter."

22:07:30 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:07:30 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hmm I might go for that too."

22:07:45 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "An apple fritter? Don't think they have them at NQ."

22:07:52 [General Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "An apple fritter sounds rather brilliant, actually."

22:07:55 You grin.

22:07:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Welcome new league cadet."

22:08:09 [General Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Hello."

22:08:09 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:08:09 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Where? Another one?"

22:08:20 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Lots of new cadets Hello!"

22:08:30 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles. "I said new league cadet, not AEU."

22:08:40 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:08:40 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Oh hiya, welcome and silliness like that. Avoid Evenia she's a bad influence."

22:08:52 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Indeed."

22:08:57 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:08:57 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "She got ahold of me and see what happened."

22:08:59 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Now I'm hurt! I'm a new AEU cadet!"

22:09:13 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well we already don't like you, so that's not a problem."

22:09:14 [General Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Oh. Right. Sorry. Didn't hear you correctly."

22:09:21 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:09:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You're a lot of things but neither new, nor a cadet."

22:09:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles. "It's okay. I was just kidding around anyway."

22:09:37 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

22:09:55 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Be nice Eve, or Firestorm will storm your beacons again and haunt your dreams."

22:09:56 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What am I Lexie? General consensis is scum of the universe."

22:10:06 Lexie Amarras says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Um evenia you flipped your lid, the only cadets on are all AEU."

22:10:14 You laugh.

22:10:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach mutters. "Fuckin' thing has done that enough."

22:10:36 Lexie Amarras says, "Well then."

22:10:40 You chuckle.

22:10:41 Lexie Amarras leans on the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit".

22:10:46 You say, "She's kidding with me."

22:10:51 You tickle Lexie Amarras!

22:10:53 Lexie Amarras says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Hmm right."

22:10:56 You hum a quiet tune.

22:11:00 Lexie Amarras giggles.

22:11:00 You say, "I didn't do it."

22:11:03 Lexie Amarras says, "Right."

22:11:09 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm innocent."

22:11:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs. "And I'm green."

22:11:25 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:11:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Get your coffee already woman and come out here and see we're right."

22:11:52 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Lexie, you should answer Vernos's question."

22:11:58 You lean on the three-person clipper "Firestorm".

22:12:01 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:12:01 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You and that damned arachnoid that I know you'll drag along just to be mean."

22:12:08 I can't find "firestorm."

22:12:12 I can't find "firestorm."

22:12:20 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Who, my lovely Vartija? Or should I bring one of my living spiders."

22:12:21 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:12:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'm sorry Vernos, I missed it, what'd you ask me. Your colleagues were trying to tickle me to death."

22:12:42 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What am I Lexie? General consensis is scum of the universe."

22:12:44 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Who? What? Where? When? And how many times?"

22:13:14 You tickle Lexie Amarras!

22:13:15 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:13:15 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I don't make a judgement until I hear both sides of it, and frankly the whole mess is so tangled at this point that I wouldn't be qualified to pass judgment on either side I think."

22:13:26 You tickle Lexie Amarras!

22:13:30 You hum a quiet tune.

22:13:51 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "At least someone has common sense."

22:13:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It kinda makes me think of that big ball of tentacles in that rift thing. All tangled together."

22:14:13 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:14:14 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "So probably the simple version is I"m withholding judgement. You seem decent enough when I've dealt with you, but people who sell out other people have to, so that doesn't prove a lot. So I'm being fairly neutral til I see more evidence."

22:14:37 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:14:37 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Sorry, not very comforting, but take it for what it's worth."

22:14:46 You smile at Lexie Amarras.

22:14:56 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "As far as sides, that's a bit complicated."

22:15:04 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

22:15:04 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:15:05 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:15:05 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:15:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:15:06 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:15:07 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:15:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well. That's much better than "You're a dick. Go fuck yourself..." etcetera. etcetera."

22:15:10 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

22:15:10 You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:15:10 You exit the ship.
[League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station; Docking Bay]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" and the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" are parked here.
Lexie Amarras is standing here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

22:15:18 Lexie Amarras laughs.

22:15:48 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Its complicated."

22:15:48 You laugh.

22:15:52 Lexie Amarras says, "As far as it goes, I liked him the few times I dealt with him, and the attributed motives don't add up for me, but I have a hard time with people who sell out, or seem to sell out a large number of their colleagues."

22:16:03 You nod to Lexie Amarras.

22:16:15 You say, "He feels like he's caught in the middle of a web."

22:16:17 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:16:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well, being neither against or for is better than ravening for your blood and knocking you down every time you say something."

22:16:21 Lexie Amarras says, "I can imagine."

22:16:32 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Exactly."

22:16:36 Lexie Amarras says, "It's a nasty situation. I'm sure he thinks he has good motives. We always do."

22:16:51 You nod.

22:17:08 Lexie Amarras says, "I wasn't really close with any of you guys when it all went down, so I'm playing it based on my personal interactions since I haven't ever gotten the full story straight."

22:17:17 You say, "I'm not hunting him and I'm not going to exclude him from activities."

22:17:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Man has a right to speak on general comms without having his head eaten off. No matter who is right or wrong, or what is."

22:17:28 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Dick that can fuck itself is pretty accurate."

22:17:31 You nod to Lexie Amarras.

22:17:37 Lexie Amarras says, "My initial sympathies lie more with Eli and Ather, but I"m not going to shit on Vernos either."

22:17:49 You nod.

22:18:15 You say, "Well, and indirectly, I was affected too as I was removed from office."

22:18:33 Lexie Amarras says, "See, I'm not sure who all was done what to whom in all of that."

22:18:43 You say, "I'm sure and it is complicated."

22:18:44 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "But I am just worthless unreg in eyes of Best. Not even human. So there is that."

22:18:48 Lexie Amarras says, "But if that shit had gone down with us, there would have probably been heads rolling."

22:18:55 You nod.

22:18:56 Lexie Amarras nods.

22:18:57 You say, "For sure."

22:19:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not even. I call you friend. And have endless respect for you. Ash."

22:19:05 [League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station; Docking Bay]

22:19:05 A small, basic docking bay is the core of the station, along with the life support system and resource storage. Small hatches lead to the other station modules.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" and the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" are parked here.
Lexie Amarras is standing here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

22:19:05 Minor Change: ArachnoPals should now be smart enough to remember where their food is.

22:19:20 the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit"

22:19:20 You see a scout here.
"Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" is written along its hull in flaming neon yellow letters.
The designation "FS-28-101" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a neon purple color with neon green trim. Its laser turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in neon yellow. The bays of its torpedo launchers are oiled to perfection and painted neon yellow. Its landing struts are slightly rusty and painted neon green.
It has a racing stripe forward on the starboard side, a racing stripe forward on the port side, a Fringe logo on the forward end, a stylized Jinu decal near the hatch, a tailfin on the rearward end, and a complicated anchor assembly on the underside.

22:19:22 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:19:22 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I don't believe that. I've enjoyed my interactions with the few mutuality members I've had dealings with."

22:19:23 I can't find "ex."

22:19:30 [MTTS] usfolks: Yay. No more arachnopal hungry seizures.

22:19:33 You lean on the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit".

22:19:39 [MTTS] something: Help, help, these spiders just got smarter! They're going to take over!

22:19:44 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Likewise."

22:19:57 [MTTS] Butchulla: Oh, that's wonderful hosts. Chasing them down so they don't starve would at times get interesting.

22:19:59 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Tell that to leadership of AEU."

22:20:02 Tanny Hill does not seem to have an active communicator.

22:20:14 [MTTS] something: But yeah, thanks for the change.

22:20:17 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "As I said, things are not so black and white."

22:20:38 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "There are things which are binary."

22:21:00 You say to Lexie, "Hope you don't mind me leaning on your ship. I'm not trying to flirt with you."

22:21:05 You grin.

22:21:10 Lexie Amarras says, "Say no problem."

22:21:14 Lexie Amarras says, OOCly, "Phone call one sec."

22:21:23 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Rarely are things purely black and white."

22:21:25 [MTTS] Squidmind: They'll have to eat once to learn, but after that they should pathfind back when they're hungry enough.

22:21:33 [MTTS] Butchulla: It'll also mean that bit less bloat, because, less trays of food. Double thank you.

22:22:21 You say, OOCly, "No problem."

22:22:46 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I would say you either think Best is terrible or you do not. It is a black and white issue for me."

22:23:06 [MTTS] something: Out of curiosity, do felo do the same?

22:23:22 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "There are choices people make which are irredeemable and despite any other actions they may take, they will never overcome those choices."

22:23:49 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I said rearely are things black and white. However, there are certainly things that are."

22:23:58 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Rarely."

22:24:08 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yes, they have for a long time.

22:24:18 [MTTS] something: Ah.

22:24:37 [MTTS] Squidmind: They also pathfind to their nests periodically.

22:24:41 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Sure. In this case, you either stand against Best, or you do not. It is simple."

22:24:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

22:25:04 [MTTS] usfolks: One day when I was bored I went through the old changelogs on the website. Yes...I was very, very bored...but the point is, you guys put a shit ton of work into this game. And we really do appreciate it.

22:25:04 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:25:05 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Things aren't so easy when you're living under a regime you don't entirely agree with. You have to be careful and tra gen not so simple when your family, loved ones, and others live under the regime and are not as free as you are."

22:25:24 You nod to Lexie Amarras.

22:25:27 You say, "I agree."

22:25:28 Lexie Amarras says, "Anyway, nah, lean on the ship, it's a good leaning place."

22:25:32 You say, "And well said."

22:25:39 You grin.

22:25:48 You say, "I just won't lean on you."

22:25:50 You grin.

22:25:55 Lexie Amarras says, "Well I'm sure the mutuality folks have a different perspective, they can always load on a ship and go to another station, or just fly out a few light years."

22:26:03 [MTTS] something: Hey, now I feel less crazy. I did that too.

22:26:06 [MTTS] Squidmind: Thanks!

22:26:08 [MTTS] Butchulla: On the critter topic, I really love the detail you guys have gone into with every kind of animal. They really are one of the joys of this game. I mean, even including fish death, and seeing it happen...Much respect goes to you guys for all of that code. I'm glad it wasn't me, coding all that.

22:26:10 Lexie Amarras says, "Makes for a different style of politics."

22:26:29 [MTTS] something: Seconded.

22:26:55 You nod to Lexie Amarras. "Exactly."

22:26:57 Lexie Amarras says, "The one thing that I think many people don't realize is that all three of our governments run on something of a similar principle, we have an illusion of democracy, but the big boys and girls at the top wield much more power than they probably should."

22:26:58 [MTTS] usfolks: Agreed. I guess sometimes I wonder if you guys know how much we do appreciate what you do. So...we do!

22:27:19 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "People must make a stand against such things. Failure to do so will only entrench the regime. Risks are dangerous, to be sure. But without risk you have no reward and no hope at all."

22:27:23 You nod to Lexie Amarras.

22:27:26 [MTTS] kayden: Now passing out bottles of ego feed 3000 to all players.

22:27:27 Lexie Amarras says, "That's one place where the fringe is at least a little more open about. We know we're living in a dictatorship."

22:27:30 Lexie Amarras grins.

22:27:37 [MTTS] Butchulla: Oh definitely. 100% respect and appreciation. This game is awesome, and you guys rock.

22:27:44 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, well said, Aisling."

22:28:06 You say, "Very true."

22:28:08 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:28:08 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Agreed, but one has to make one's stands in various ways, and sometimes the best way is to infiltrate. Not saying that's what happened here, but until I know more, I won't rule it out."

22:28:13 [MTTS] usfolks: It's not ego. They do a lot of work...so that we have this game that so many of us enjoy. They deserve a thank you from time to time.

22:28:39 [MTTS] kayden: Its a joke.

22:28:54 Lexie Amarras says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Evenia, do we need to take you to the med center and get an intravenous injection of coffee to raise you from the dead?"

22:29:01 You chuckle.

22:29:03 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I think what bothers me more is that other alliances have not taken more vocal stand against AEU leaving Accord."

22:29:40 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Call to pressure AEU. Renegotiate trade. Sanctions. Make it hurt."

22:29:50 You smile at Lexie Amarras.

22:29:59 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:29:59 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I agree Aisling, I was very vocal in the League hate on Vernos meeting to that effect. My point was that whether or not Vernos was at fault, we needed to try and force our own governments to make a stronger stand against the AEu's actions."

22:30:07 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Alliances have power to do this but they seem content to let them do this alone."

22:30:23 You say, "She does have a point."

22:30:31 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:30:31 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I think it's a false sense of security. And I wouldn't be surprised if there's some outside interference at play."

22:30:40 You nod.

22:30:43 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:30:43 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "After all remember the Renegade War."

22:30:49 You tickle Lexie Amarras!

22:30:52 Lexie Amarras giggles.

22:30:53 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Here is the thing, Best would just pass the hurt onto the pilots in retalation."

22:30:58 Lexie Amarras says, "Stop that. If you're not flirting."

22:31:01 Lexie Amarras grins.

22:31:04 You chuckle.

22:31:05 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "So?"

22:31:25 You say, "Sorry."

22:31:29 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:31:29 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That was the concensus, but if we feel strongly about something we should act accordingly, pain and risk as Aisling said earlier are part of standing up for what's right."

22:31:47 Lexie Amarras says, "I"m trying to wax philosophical hard to do that while I"m giggling in my com."

22:31:48 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "AEU pilots are in this mess because of own selfishness as it is."

22:31:54 Lexie Amarras grins at you.

22:32:06 You say, "True, but it's fun to watch you try."

22:32:08 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Voted for Best by and large to ensure they could just stay pilots and ignored his rhetoric."

22:32:14 Lexie Amarras laughs.

22:32:15 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "All they cared about was continuing to be pilots."

22:32:37 Lexie Amarras says, "A little extremist, maybe Nina Thomas should recruit her as a public spokesman."

22:32:45 You chuckle.

22:32:56 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "So now the time has come to make it right. If that means some suffering, so be it. Or will you again take the easy path?"

22:33:10 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "The one which is most convenient for you."

22:33:22 Lexie Amarras says, "What the mutuality needs is a total gassing of all their stations.... with nitrous oxide."

22:33:22 You say, "She has always been a bit exrreme."

22:33:28 Lexie Amarras nods.

22:33:28 You say, "Extreme."

22:33:40 Lexie Amarras says, "Get em laughing and maybe they'd loosen up."

22:33:45 You laugh.

22:34:21 Lexie Amarras says, "I wouldn't be surprised if I haven't pissed off a significant proportion of people jsut by being funny on coms."

22:34:25 Lexie Amarras grins.

22:34:25 You say to Lexie, "Sorry, didn't mean to offend you there."

22:34:31 Lexie Amarras says, "You're not."

22:34:32 You grin at Lexie Amarras.

22:34:43 You say, "You haven't pissed me off on comms yet."

22:34:52 Lexie Amarras says, "Give me time."

22:34:53 Lexie Amarras grins.

22:35:02 Lexie Amarras says, "I just can't stand gloom and doom all the time."

22:35:07 You grin.

22:35:16 You say, "I just say random shit on comms."

22:35:25 Lexie Amarras says, "Works."

22:35:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So, nest?"

22:35:55 Lexie Amarras cackles!

22:35:59 Lexie Amarras says, "Oh boy here I go."

22:36:07 You ask, "Wait, I didn't offend you or I am not sorry?"

22:36:17 You grin at Lexie Amarras.

22:36:34 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:36:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Shule and I are thinking of founding a new alliance the Mutual Confederation for the Preservation of Humority. All people with a sense of humor are allowed to join."

22:36:44 You chuckle.

22:37:02 Lexie Amarras says, "Nah what did you offend me by saying I apparently missed it utterly. So must not have been that offensive."

22:37:07 You say, "Ah, ok."

22:37:14 You say, "No, tickling you."

22:37:17 Lexie Amarras says, "Ahh nah."

22:37:33 Lexie Amarras says, "Just saying you need to realize that if you keep doing that it could lead to more than you bargain for."

22:37:52 Lexie stretches and wiggles in an exaggerated manner.

22:38:16 You ask, "Reallly?"

22:38:31 Shule grins mischievously,.

22:38:36 Lexie Amarras says, "Possibly. I don't know, I might throw you back and try to get the intimate details of what really happened from Vernos."

22:38:41 Lexie Amarras grins at you.

22:39:17 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

22:40:00 Shule tickles you and runs to hide behind the three-person clipper "Firestorm".

22:40:21 Lexie Amarras says, "Hide behind that utterly dull ship."

22:40:26 Lexie Amarras pats the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" lightly.

22:40:39 Lexie Amarras says, "Now this is a ship with class. Ugly but class."

22:40:42 Lexie Amarras grins.

22:40:54 You grin.

22:41:02 You say, "My ship is bigger. Easier to hid behind."

22:41:05 You say, "Hide."

22:41:11 the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit"

22:41:11 You see a scout here.
"Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" is written along its hull in flaming neon yellow letters.

22:41:34 Lexie Amarras gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "True."

22:41:43 You grin.

22:42:11 Lexie Amarras says, "Heh you aught to see my wing. Done out in basically the same paint job etc but I got an outsider decal on it too. A dead outsider."

22:42:16 You exclaim, "Nice!"

22:42:34 Lexie Amarras says, "Need to find a ocuple of idiots, I mean brave souls to come out with me in it so I can give it its virgin run."

22:42:45 You exclaim, "I'll come along!"

22:42:46 You exclaim, "I'll come along!"

22:42:46 You exclaim, "I'll come along!"

22:42:47 You exclaim, "I'll come along!"

22:42:50 Lexie Amarras says, "You're very very insane."

22:42:54 You say, OOCly, "Oops, sorry."

22:43:04 You ask, "Why?"

22:43:07 Lexie Amarras says, "Gonzo let me fly a couple of beacons in his ship and I think we got home with a prayer and some duct tatpe."

22:43:26 You say, "If it gets that bad, I can take over."

22:43:34 Lexie Amarras says, "True."

22:44:06 Lexie Amarras says, "Well first off, I won't be so stupid at to fly anything crazy at first. I figure when I do take it out I'll try a low first then move to a standard. I flew two standards on gonzo's the second one went better."

22:44:16 You say to Lexie, "And if I was flirting with you, I'd have tried to kiss you or something. But I don't feel like getting killed though."

22:44:23 Lexie Amarras says, "Smart."

22:44:34 Lexie Amarras says, "I know judo, karate, kung fu, and a bunch of other scary sounding words."

22:44:35 You say, "Well, fly what you're comfortable iwth."

22:44:38 You say, "With."

22:44:50 Lexie Amarras says, "Yep, got to walk before I run."

22:45:00 Lexie Amarras says, "My gunning has gotten somewhat better though."

22:45:09 You grin at Lexie Amarras.

22:45:20 You say, "So you would kill me, that's what your saying? Heh."

22:45:58 Lexie Amarras says, "When we took that cruiser out with Ali the other day I got worst several times round, but I was also up to third place out of 5 weapon rooms several times too. I was averaging about 20%."

22:46:06 Lexie Amarras says, "No I wouldn't kill you."

22:46:12 Lexie Amarras seems rather amused with herself.

22:46:22 Lexie Amarras says, "I'd probably fuck you to exhaustion then lock you in a box for later."

22:46:28 You laugh.

22:46:30 You exclaim, "Wow!"

22:46:33 You laugh.

22:46:46 Lexie Amarras says, "It's been a while. Don't play with a repressed drive."

22:46:49 Lexie Amarras grins.

22:47:02 You say, "Hey, I was so bad at gunning that I was afraid that I'd never be invited on beacons ever again."

22:47:08 Lexie Amarras laughs.

22:47:16 You say, "When I first was starting out."

22:47:26 Lexie Amarras says, "That's how I felt the first time. It was like so and so 50%, second person 45 percent then lexie with like 3."

22:47:40 Lexie Amarras says, "But it's all practice."

22:47:43 You ask, "You got 3 percent? I think I got 1 percent or no hits?"

22:47:48 You chuckle.

22:47:51 Lexie Amarras says, "I don't remember honestly."

22:47:54 Lexie Amarras says, "But it was bad."

22:47:56 You grin.

22:48:12 [MTTS] usfolks: This is weird, but from an ooc animal lover...it would be so cool if we could groom our felo. Use a brush on them. Would be a neat bonding thing.

22:48:35 You lean on the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit".

22:48:37 Lexie Amarras says, "I'm a lot better with ground combat. But I eventaully wanna get decent wherever i'm needed. People who specialize are good at what they do but useless in other situations."

22:48:44 You nod.

22:48:45 [MTTS] Butchulla: It really would actually.

22:48:53 You say, "It's good to be well-rounded."

22:49:00 Lexie Amarras says, "I might not be the best engineer but if we need an engineer I wanna be able to do it etc."

22:49:05 Lexie Amarras says, "Yep."

22:49:24 Lexie Amarras says, "Eventually I wanna go exploring more."

22:49:28 You grin.

22:49:31 Lexie Amarras says, "That's my end goal."

22:49:42 Lexie Amarras says, "I wanna go coreward."

22:49:50 Shule subtlely plays with yourhair.

22:49:52 Lexie gets a distant somewhat sad look.

22:49:58 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ather?"

22:50:09 You ask, "Why coreward? Any reason in particular?"

22:50:17 Lexie Amarras says, "I wanna find the JInu."

22:50:20 Lexie Amarras says, "Jinu."

22:50:24 Lexie Amarras says, "Well not precisely."

22:50:35 Lexie Amarras says, "I wanna find Jinu space. That's where my parents might be."

22:50:41 You say, "Ah, ok."

22:50:45 You say, "Makes sense."

22:50:53 You say, "A lot of people want to find it."

22:50:58 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep?"

22:51:01 Lexie Amarras says, "They were Xenologists. When the war broke out, well we lost contact of course."

22:51:09 You nod.

22:51:13 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "What is your crafting fee, if I provide all the parts?"

22:51:28 Lexie Amarras says, "Finding the Jinu would of course be helpful for all of us, but that's my main reason."

22:51:34 You say, "For sure."

22:51:43 You say, "I understand."

22:51:45 Lexie sniffs a little.

22:51:48 Lexie Amarras says, "In any case."

22:52:00 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Two golden taels."

22:52:04 Lexie Amarras says, "Obviously there's not enough coffee to keep her mind on things so I'm going to fly to chetumal and kick Evenia's ass."

22:52:08 Shule continues to subtlely play with your hair.

22:52:11 You say, "Ah, ok."

22:52:13 You grin.

22:52:14 Lexie Amarras says, "You sir are honing for a box."

22:52:20 You chuckle.

22:52:25 Lexie punches Shule lightly on the arm.

22:52:34 Lexie Amarras says, "Alright time to go kill spider lady."

22:52:38 Some lights on the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" flash as Lexie Amarras boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

22:52:38 Shule playfully slaps your butt.

22:52:40 You say, "Ok."

22:52:44 You say, "Ok."

22:52:53 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

22:52:53 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:52:54 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:52:55 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:52:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:52:56 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:52:56 You begin the launch sequence.

22:52:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity. Okay...I'll send payment and parts."

22:53:01 A launch trajectory is located.

22:53:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:53:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:53:15 Starships In Sector:

22:53:16 
Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit.....................(11, 11, 19)
Peacekeeper Task Force Psi 2............(7, 19, 18)
Peacekeeper Task Force Zeta 2...........(7, 18, 8)

22:53:21 The computer reports that the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" has jumped out of the sector.

22:53:22 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:53:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:53:23 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:53:25 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

22:53:26 
Fringe scout "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" departed to Fringe sector The Fringe (Alpha-1) less than a minute ago.

22:53:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:53:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:53:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:53:29 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:53:30 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:53:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:53:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:53:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:53:34 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:53:37 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

22:54:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:54:06 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:54:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:54:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:54:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:54:24 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:54:24 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:54:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:04:47 You exit the ship.

23:04:47 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

23:04:50 [Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

23:04:50 You see a gleaming granite-topped bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a trash can emblazoned with the triumphant image of Space Chief Marshal Nina Thomas, and a brightly-colored educational poster here.
You can go out.

23:04:52 [MTTS] Squidmind: If it's 'toensure', just seen it myself.

23:04:55 You see a flash of some bird of prey streaking by the window.

23:05:05 [MTTS] atherj: OK.

23:05:06 [MTTS] usfolks: Ah. I don't need to support then. Woo.

23:05:13 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:05:22 [MTTS] Squidmind: And should be fixed.  Anything else you spot let us know, though!

23:05:27 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Last call. One for beacons in case people missed the first call."

23:05:42 [MTTS] atherj: For sure.

23:05:53 [MTTS] usfolks: How about communitees?

23:06:01 [MTTS] atherj: Already reported that.

23:06:05 [MTTS] usfolks: Ah.

23:06:13 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

23:06:20 [MTTS] atherj: Premanent hasn't been fixed yet though.

23:10:56 Lexie Amarras's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok that's what I thought."

23:11:01 [MTTS] usfolks: Oddly enough, that change to the help file showed as an announcement, but there are no new announcements. Is that normal?

23:11:06 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:11:16 [MTTS] Squidmind: Since it was a minor announcement it didn't get logged.

23:11:22 Recent Minor Changes:

23:11:23 
-----
Inactive orgs will no longer show up on the menu in mess halls.
   Posted 5 days, 16 hours, 48 minutes, and 6 seconds ago
-----
Whether people are jostled in crowded control rooms now has more to do with who has actually recently been near the controls, though larger groups of people will continue to be an inconvenience regardless, depending on the size of the ship. Also, more commands will potentially result in jostling.

This means that, for example, a fighter cockpit becomes crowded very easily. However, a handful of people in the control room of a large ship will not cause issues unless multiple people are actually reaching for the controls around the same time.
   Posted 3 days, 1 hour, 9 minutes, and 41 seconds ago
-----
The commands RIFT STATUS and RIFT LOCATIONS will no longer provoke jostling.
   Posted 20 hours, 12 minutes, and 40 seconds ago
-----
People who were troubled by the knowledge of exactly what debris was being expelled can now breathe a little easier; this information is now obscured if you are not in the control room.
   Posted 20 hours, 5 minutes, and 25 seconds ago
-----
ArachnoPals should now be smart enough to remember where their food is.

You suddenly float up into the air as the ship's artificial gravity abruptly switches off, and you feel your hair stand on end as the ship projects an electromagnetic field around you. Suddenly, every seam of the ship seems to come apart, exposing you to space. You quickly close your eyes as the vacuum pulls at your skin and the electromagnetic field tugs you rapidly toward a starship rescue pod.
Your right arm has been injured!
The limb seems to be broken.
[Ad Infinitum Rescue Pod]
You can go nowhere.
The pod simply drifts for a moment as its automatic navigation systems come online. Then it smoothly maneuvers through the wreckage of the starship and out into open space.

23:28:40 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Oops."

23:28:43 You say, "Sorry."

23:28:46 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.

23:29:00 [Ad Infinitum Rescue Pod]

23:29:01 This pod is rather cramped quarters, consisting of a circle of seats with harnesses to secure the occupants. Space is saved by the almost total lack of any sort of flight control whatsoever, although a tiny starmap display and a very few other status readouts are available. Equipment thrums under your feet, where the flight computer and the pod's various drives are housed. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see a dark yellow leather captain's chair, a swiveling dark purple leather gunner's chair, a "Ad Infinitum" salvage container, and a Fringe Legionnaire here.
Lexie Amarras is standing here.
You can go nowhere.

23:29:05 You say, "I'm sorry. Oh, the pain!"

23:29:09 The computer reports that the one-person marauder "Fiat Justitia" has entered the sector.

23:29:13 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

23:29:13 Lexie Amarras says, "That's why I wanted to do this with my own ship."

23:29:13 You say, "I should have taken over sooner."

23:29:17 Lexie Amarras grins.

23:29:27 You hug Lexie Amarras.

23:29:29 The computer reports that the enkidu "Corvette Delta Xi Theta" has entered the sector.

23:29:30 [MTTS] kaite: Yeah age should be irrelevant in this day.

23:29:32 Lexie Amarras says, "Maybe, but I thought I was ok. I should have called for help sooner than that."

23:29:37 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:29:37 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

23:29:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:29:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:29:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

23:29:42 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:29:43 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

23:29:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:29:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:29:45 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:29:46 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

23:29:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:29:50 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:29:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:29:53 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Hello there, Ad Infinitum Rescue Pod! Welcome to home space!"

23:29:53 [MTTS] usfolks: It might, but it's not exactly accessible to me at the moment and been a long time since I've seen it...

23:29:54 Lexie Amarras says, "It's ok. Life goes on."

23:29:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:30:00 The ship rapidly heads toward a planet.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:30:01 I don't see that here.

23:30:04 I don't see that here.

23:30:05 Lexie Amarras says, "I'll buy another and we'll try this again."

23:30:07 Lexie Amarras grins.

23:30:08 You grin.

23:30:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:30:10 Rescue workers quickly empty the landed rescue pod.

23:30:12 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]

23:30:12 The Ad Infinitum rescue pod is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.
A rescue worker glances at you and says, "You're hurt. You'd better get to a medcenter."
Spaceport workers efficiently haul the spent pod out of the way.

23:30:12 You say, "Or we'll take my ship."

23:30:16 Lexie Amarras says, "At least it wasn't the wing."

23:30:47 You nod.

23:30:49 You say, "Just did."

23:30:50 [MTTS] Ulias: I kick myself for not being around during the election time, sounds like it would have been some great, though frustrating fun.

23:30:58 I see no "statue" here.

23:31:01 [MTTS] ryoga has joined the channel.

23:31:02 Lexie Amarras says, "Ok disband and i'll take you on board my transport to dump this stuff."

23:31:14 You disband your group.

23:32:44 You ask, "And where's the med enter? Ah! It's broken!"

23:32:49 You say, "Er, med center."

23:32:56 Lexie Amarras says, "I'll take you."

23:32:58 Lexie Amarras drops a "Ad Infinitum" salvage container.

23:32:58 As soon as a "Ad Infinitum" salvage container hits the ground, it suddenly shatters into a billion pieces, never to be seen again.

23:33:22 Do you wish to pay this?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

23:33:23 You pay the fee.

23:33:23 You lower yourself slowly into a medical creche.

23:33:24 Lexie Amarras says, "Here you go."

23:33:28 You grin.

23:33:35 [MTTS] Ulias: Because it's Sc, the land of constantly discovering things you didn't nkow about.

23:33:40 Lexie Amarras gives you 200,000.00 Fringe credits.

23:33:45 Lexie Amarras says, "That should cover it."

23:33:53 You say, "Oh, you didn't have to do that."

23:34:09 Lexie Amarras says, "Yes I did. You were nuts enough to come along. I'm nuts enough to reinburse you for getting you blown up."

23:34:13 Lexie Amarras grins.

23:34:16 You grin.

23:34:32 Lexie Amarras says, "Well I've done my part to sabotage the fringe economy for today."

23:34:38 [MTTS] Ulias: I've been here for years, give or take and still come across things that bewilder me. Just the other day I found a starship command that I still haven't found out what it does.

23:34:39 You chuckle.

23:34:41 Lexie Amarras says, "I think I'll move on to other things."

23:34:48 You say, "Let's take my ship and clear it out."

23:34:53 The medical creche's healing has ceased.

23:34:53 You say, "I'll fly."

23:35:10 [Chetumal Spaceport; Medical Center]

23:35:10 The design of this small but modern medical center is modular, with pale gray walls and slightly rounded corners. Arrays of diagnostic equipment and cabinets of medicines are carefully guarded and maintained by the efficient white-clad personnel on duty. Several sleekly designed medical creches, rather dismayingly shaped like coffins, are lined up along the far side of the room. A sign overhead instructs those with injuries to LIE in a CRECHE.
Lexie Amarras is standing here.
You can go southwest.

23:35:29 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:35:29 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:35:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:35:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

23:35:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:35:41 [MTTS] ricolachen: Hey, at least library is active now.

23:35:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:35:47 Which sector did you mean?

23:35:47 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

23:35:48 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:35:48 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:35:49 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:35:50 [MTTS] Ulias: This one actualy did toggle something though. Something about toggling sensor interpretations.

23:35:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:35:52 You say, "We'll grab a sout."

23:35:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:35:55 You say, "Scout."

23:35:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:35:56 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:35:56 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

23:35:57 [MTTS] Butchulla: And then sometimes you find yourself wondering strange things about this land, like exactly how many sanitation drones exist.

23:35:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:36:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:36:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:36:01 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:36:04 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:36:04 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

23:36:04 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

23:36:06 [MTTS] usfolks: Billions.

23:36:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:36:09 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

23:36:10 Lexie Amarras wanders up.

23:36:17 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Hang on, come back down."

23:36:20 Lexie Amarras wanders in from above.

23:36:24 Lexie Amarras asks, "Yes?"

23:36:26 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "We're taking a different ship."

23:36:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:36:26 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:36:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:36:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:36:35 Lexie Amarras says, "Makes sense. Since this is like too big."

23:36:36 [MTTS] ricolachen: REPORTS toggles if you see ships coming in and out or so I believe.

23:36:37 You say, "We're going to grab my scout."

23:36:39 Lexie Amarras nods.

23:36:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:36:41 You are credited with 876,623.38 EAOS credits of bounty.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

23:36:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:36:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:36:44 You scramble to your feet.

23:36:44 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

23:37:14 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:37:14 [MTTS] Ulias: Ah, thanks. Still need to find out IC now, but that helps.

23:37:16 [MTTS] Squidmind: It toggles off lots of things, I believe. Something to be used only in particular situations.

You can go up and out.

23:37:46 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:37:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:37:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:37:48 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire and Lexie Amarras.

23:37:49 Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

23:37:52 Not ejected.

23:37:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Striking Distance, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:37:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:37:54 Lexie Amarras's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Bounty? We didn't kill anything did we?"

23:38:01 [MTTS] ryoga: Joyful commands many will never know the joyous joy of enjoying.

23:38:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:38:05 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "N?o idea."

23:38:13 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Where was the beacon at?"

23:38:17 Lexie Amarras's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I didn't see it. But maybe that last torpedo."

23:38:20 [MTTS] kaite: Like autogal and construct and structure for grins.

23:38:23 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Maybe."

23:38:24 The computer reports that the two-person heavy launch vessel "Registered Merchant 995" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

23:38:25 Lexie Amarras's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "North one from second battle."

23:38:27 [MTTS] Butchulla: That made my head spin. It's too early for tongue twisters.

23:38:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Six jumps to The Second Battle Of Deep Candelaria Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:38:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:38:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Borderlands."

23:38:33 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok."

23:38:34 [MTTS] usfolks: Those were the ones I was referring to, yes.

23:38:36 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:38:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:38:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:38:39 Once the frontier of Known Space for many years, the Borderlands region is now a settled area of space, though rather poor compared to most others. A handful of beacons indicate the positions of clouds of debris, but a nearby star indicates a solar system may also be in this cluster.

The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:39:00 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Second Battle of Deep Candelaria Orbit."

23:39:01 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "All what?"

23:39:01 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:39:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:39:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:39:04 Suddenly your ship is in the midst of a cloud of debris. Clearly these are the remnants of a great battle, having long since drifted away from where it originally took place.

23:39:07 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-105 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Striking Distance.' Welcome to The Second Battle of Deep Candelaria Orbit."

23:39:10 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "AEU people."

23:39:11 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

23:39:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:39:20 [MTTS] kaite: Enjoyed discovering them elsewhere though.

23:39:25 [MTTS] Ulias: Even flautulate was removed, it seems. Oh the tragedy!

23:39:28 Via general sector communication, Orcinus Orca transmits a text-based transmission: "If you're here for the beacon, it's been taken care of."

23:39:32 [MTTS] Ulias: Er flatulate.

23:39:32 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

23:39:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:39:48 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "They took care of it."

23:39:49 The computer reports that the five-person torpedo boat "Orcinus Orca" has jumped out of the sector.

23:39:54 Lexie Amarras's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ahh."

23:40:58 [MTTS] kaite: Yes I also miss the drunkeness states I know we need to RP that but those were good.

23:41:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:41:02 You cuddle up to Lexie Amarras.

23:41:04 Lexie Amarras says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Yeah, well, didn't do so hot and we were really far gone. That was me trying my hand at piloting again."

23:41:07 Lexie Amarras hugs you.

23:41:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:41:12 You hug Lexie Amarras.

23:41:12 Lexie Amarras says, "Gonzo got them."

23:41:14 You hold Lexie Amarras's hand, taking her into your group.

23:42:03 [MTTS] usfolks: If you think about it, the spelling you have to do to mess that up sounds remotely like actually vomiting. But it does make for some interesting things happening.

23:42:08 Lexie Amarras wanders up.

23:42:10 Lexie Amarras wanders in from above.

23:42:12 Your ship 'Striking Distance' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:42:21 You ask, "'so, going to go haul more rocks?"

23:42:24 You grin.

23:42:26 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:42:26 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:42:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:42:31 Lexie Amarras says, "No I think I may take a nap."

23:42:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:42:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:42:37 You say, "Awww, ok."

23:42:40 You wrap your arms around Lexie Amarras, pulling her close.

23:42:42 You're already sitting.

23:42:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-bindin
23:44:33 g resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on 10 July 2317 GST. Time remaining: 22 days, 2 hours, 19 minutes, and 47 seconds

23:44:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:44:39 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:44:42 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

23:45:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:45:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:45:40 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:45:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:45:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:45:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:45:58 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:45:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:46:00 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:46:31 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:46:49 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:46:50 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:52:15 Shine the big white glowing felo kitten

23:52:16 This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, speckled white fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thin, hooked white claws visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of clear blue eyes with vertical pupils. It puts out a subtle white bioluminescence tinged with light green.

23:52:19 You stroke the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo kitten.

23:52:20 Shine the big white glowing felo kitten purrs softly.

23:52:44 You peer out...

23:52:44 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.

23:53:47 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

23:53:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, and a fuzzy stuffed bear here.
You can go south and out.
