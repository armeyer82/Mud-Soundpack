00:17:21 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a compact purple microwave oven, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, and a League Paladin here.

00:24:10 Lily Kaise says, "I'm a little hesitant with this battlesuit repair tool though as it's generally about the first one that pilots get. However, I wouldn't mind if Constantine took it and then if he gets one, he can just sell it or put his extra in the box."

00:59:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What did Takana do?"

01:00:02 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

01:00:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, and a compact purple microwave oven here.

01:01:17 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

01:01:22 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:01:26 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:01:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Depending on the flow, I do not know if I will be there."

01:01:47 Lily Kaise says, "Yes my ammo is winding down. Perhaps 3 more."

01:01:49 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:02:08 You nod.

01:02:30 Lily Kaise says, "So we won't go back that late. Just glad to have gotten in a good bit."

01:02:35 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:02:59 You nod and smile.

01:03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "What about AEU appreciation?"

01:04:06 You glance at your communicator's screen.

01:05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, ok."

01:05:22 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:05:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh yeah we#may get to that after midnight."

01:06:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And despite what some may say, Nils resigned from her office as Voice at the time of her own free will and choice."

01:08:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do you mean, what do people say she did instead?"

01:08:53 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

01:08:58 Lily Kaise says, "Nice."

01:09:00 Lily Kaise stands up from your lap.

01:09:05 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:09:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, some people have said that the AEu kicked her out, but we didn't."

01:09:15 Lily Kaise glides up.

01:58:09 You light your battlesuit's ascent rockets and hurl yourself down the corridor and out through the access point.

01:58:10 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:58:29 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

01:58:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a compact purple microwave oven, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.
You can go up and out.

01:58:33 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

01:58:34 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a compact purple microwave oven, Lily Kaise (League Paladin), and an AEU Combat Universalist here.
You can go up and out.
You collect the items you retrieved from the battle and place them into a leather briefcase.

01:58:43 I can't find "pillw."

01:58:46 You sit down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:58:50 A League Paladin suddenly splits down the front and deposits Lily Kaise.

01:58:53 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:59:16 Lily Kaise says, "Ok all I have left is in the harpoon. I think we could do one more but you know how that one misses so I'm ok to go back if you want."

01:59:35 You say, "Yeahm, let's go back."

01:59:38 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

01:59:40 Lily Kaise grins.

01:59:43 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:59:48 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:59:49 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002."

01:59:49 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:59:59 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:00:00 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:00:00 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:00:01 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:00:03 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:00:06 I don't understand that.

02:00:06 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

02:00:07 The starship has left a unique area of space.

02:00:11 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

02:00:12 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:00:14 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:00:16 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] 160,000,000.00 credits have been deducted from the starship support fund.

02:00:16 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:00:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "The results are in!"

02:00:18 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:00:19 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:00:20 0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

02:00:22 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We achieved our first tier performance goal! Good job! Let's go for all of them next time!"

02:00:22 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Our performance was up 103.9% from the last Conquest period. Good job!"

02:00:48 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:00:48 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

02:00:49 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

02:00:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Who is jathum?"

02:00:54 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:00:54 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Gamma 001. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

02:00:54 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:01:05 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:01:05 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:01:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And the solo fighter space combat contest as officially began. See the AEU General board for details."

02:01:06 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:01:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I know ^hey're new<@but I haven't />et (hem~"

02:01:15 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

02:01:35 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:01:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Wow sure awesome to see newer pilots taking over the goals! Keep it going!"

02:01:42 Lily Kaise grins.

02:01:45 You grin.

02:01:49 The AEU reached the first tier performance goal only.

02:01:49 Top Performers: Constantine Stone, Vernos Bailey, and Jathom Stishim.

02:04:30 Lily Kaise says, "I lost count as to how many we did haha."

A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers & Troubleshooters", a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go south and down.
Lily Kaise glides out.

02:49:39 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:49:42 I don't understand that.

02:49:43 I don't understand that.

02:49:44 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Airlock]

02:49:45 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:49:45 You exit the ship.

02:49:45 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The two-person Accord gemini "Seventh Star" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, a plastic emergency bubble, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the spaceport.

02:49:46 You can't go that way.

02:49:48 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

02:49:49 You see a friendly cadet orientation officer here.
You can go north, up, and out.

02:49:49 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

02:49:50 You can go north, east, south, and west.

02:49:50 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]
You can go north, east, south, and west.

02:49:50 You rapidly enter a few numbers into a keypad next to the door.

02:49:51 You open the door.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

02:49:55 You remove the 12:00 15/07 AEU space defense report from a brushed steel desk.

02:49:58 I don't understand that.

02:50:00 You close the door.

02:50:05 In addition, there appears to be some writing on the 12:00 15/07 AEU space defense report...

02:53:25 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

02:53:25 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

02:56:54 Kip Casper (asleep)

02:56:54 He appears to be 22 years old. He is about six feet and zero inches tall and has fair skin. His body is slightly muscled with muscled hips and strong calves. He has average-sized shoulders and a wide chest. His face is square and somewhat handsome, with an average nose and dimpled chin. His lips are average and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and round. His close-cropped, bristly hair is dark blonde and neatly combed. He also has a short dark blonde neatly trimmed beard. He has neatly trimmed pale fingernails.
 He is wearing a standard grey shipsuit and a pair of shiny black boots. He is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, an orange metachannel FTL communicator, and a small cloth sack. His head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

02:58:42 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]

02:58:42 You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, and a compact purple microwave oven here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow.
You can go up and out.

02:58:46 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:58:47 You sit down on Lily Kaise's lap.

02:58:48 Lily Kaise asks, "Ready?"

02:58:49 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:58:54 You nod.

02:58:55 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:58:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:58:56 You say, "Yep."

02:59:06 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:59:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Seventh Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:59:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:59:16 Lily Kaise giggles at you.

02:59:20 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:59:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:59:22 You ask, "What?"

02:59:25 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:59:26 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise says, "Nothing."

02:59:26 The computer says, "Destination selected. Nine jumps to Teslaworld Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:59:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Deep Wastes."

02:59:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:59:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:59:33 You say, "I'm always innocent."

02:59:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:59:33 The sensors tell you that this area is full of valuable salvage, but all you can see of it yourself is dark smudges that block the light of the stars.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Eight jumps remaining."

03:00:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:00:15 The planet known as Teslaworld rotates below you, the atmosphere looking as impenetrable as that of a gas giant. The thick clouds roil with continual storms, and lightning flashes all across the sky many times a second.

03:00:17 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:00:20 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Teslaworld.

03:00:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "This is to inform SEAS that their acting founder, is always and will forever be innocent."

03:00:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:00:25 Lily Kaise says, "Heh no pirates."

03:00:28 You say, "Nope."

03:00:30 There are no other ships in the sector.

03:00:41 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:00:41 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:00:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Seventh Star. You are granted clearance to land."

03:00:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:00:49 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:00:49 You fall from Lily Kaise's lap.

03:00:54 Lily Kaise says, "Oops sorry."

03:00:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:00:57 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:00:59 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

03:01:00 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:01:01 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:01:03 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:01:10 You press a button on an AEU Combat Universalist, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

03:01:11 [Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

03:04:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hear, hear!"

03:04:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:05:09 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

03:05:22 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:05:23 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:05:32 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

03:05:34 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:05:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:05:38 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:05:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Seventh Star, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:05:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:05:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:05:57 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:05:58 Lily Kaise says to you, "If I can get enough to work with us, are you up to cleans Old Frontier?"

03:06:01 You glance at your communicator's screen.

03:06:02 15,387,105.45 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:00 17 July 2317 GST]

03:06:03 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:06:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:06:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:06:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:06:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:06:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:06:10 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:06:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:06:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:06:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:06:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:06:16 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:06:18 You say, "Sure."

03:06:18 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Seventh Star! Welcome to home space!"

03:06:26 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:06:28 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:06:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:06:44 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:06:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok who is up for cleansing Old Frontier? I'll ask here first."

03:07:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I suppose me, myself and I are."

03:07:09 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:07:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:07:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:07:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:07:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Seventh Star. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:07:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:07:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:07:31 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:07:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm in."

03:07:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Let me dust off my plasma suit."

03:07:53 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:07:54 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok would appreciate some willing to cleanse Old Frontier. I need one plasma thrower and the reste of you well I need a repair suit and doesn't matter what else."

03:07:55 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:07:56 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:08:00 Lily Kaise stands up from your lap.

03:08:22 You say, "I'll bring my EAOS."

03:08:28 Your ship 'Seventh Star' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:08:33 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah need a repair suit and if can get that."

03:08:45 Lily Kaise says, "Bue no response so far unfortunately."

03:08:49 You nod.

03:09:37 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:09:37 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok one more call. Need an EAOS and an aEU Suit to cleans Old frontier and any others can come along for fun!"

03:10:32 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:10:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sorry I don't think we could manage with just the three of us. I'll try again around midnight tomorrow."

03:10:47 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:10:51 Lily Kaise picks up a compact white refrigerator.

03:10:52 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:11:00 Lily Kaise puts a compact white refrigerator in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:11:03 Lily Kaise picks up a small red insulated cooler.

03:11:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We should only need one more person, right?"

03:11:07 Lily Kaise puts a small red insulated cooler in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:11:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's disappointing."

03:11:41 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:11:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah well sometimes it's not an easy configuration to find."

03:11:51 Lily Kaise glides up.

03:11:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

03:11:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone sighs.

03:12:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "More of the mediocre beer at the New Phoenix Cantina, I guess."

03:12:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah I think my wine decanter is over there too!"

03:12:48 Lily Kaise glides in from above.

03:12:49 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Lily Kaise.
A personal hoverpallet floats in behind Lily Kaise.

03:13:16 Lily Kaise says to you, "Ok love going back go dove."

03:13:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, we need to get her decanter beore the bari over there become alcoholics."

03:13:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it seems like no one likes to use EAOS suits."

03:13:39 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:13:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:13:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I would but I'm glyphing."

03:13:47 You scramble to your feet.

03:13:47 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Airlock]
You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:13:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah those jerks may drain."

03:14:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "May drain the darn thing."

03:14:02 You exit the ship.

03:14:03 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the spaceport.

03:14:08 Lily Kaise exits from the two-person Accord gemini "Seventh Star".

03:14:08 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Lily Kaise.
A personal hoverpallet floats in behind Lily Kaise.

03:14:13 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:14:13 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and Mischief the large black felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:14:14 I don't understand that.

03:14:16 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:14:17 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

03:14:19 I can't find "sofa."

03:14:21 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:32:42 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

03:32:43 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:32:46 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:32:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:32:52 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:33:45 Lily Kaise says, "Did Vernos write to you concerning the question or questions he had? I didn't receive anything from him."

03:33:59 You say, "Nope, I got nothing."

03:34:14 You glance at your communicator's screen.

03:34:15 There are no notices.

03:35:02 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok oh and ineed to check the range office concerning the ateroid processor in 285. I am not sure I can stay awake for it to just go down. So are you ok to go out there with me soon to go deploy the new one Love?"

03:35:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:35:19 You say, "Ok."

03:35:22 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

03:35:22 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:35:23 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:36:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah it won't go down until like until around 0600. I can't stay awake that late."

03:37:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Neither can I."

03:37:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok then want to just go put it up? I'd prefer to get back before we both have to sleep for a little while at least Love."

03:37:51 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:37:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure."

03:37:55 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:38:08 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

03:38:24 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:38:27 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:38:33 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:38:35 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:38:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:38:38 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:38:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:38:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:38:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:38:54 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:38:55 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:38:56 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

03:38:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:39:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:39:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:39:02 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:39:03 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

03:39:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:39:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:39:08 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

03:39:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:39:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:39:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:39:12 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:39:13 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

03:39:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:39:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:39:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:39:17 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:39:20 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

03:39:42 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:39:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Constantine. We both can't stay awake until the current asteroid processor goesoffline so we'll go ahead and deploy it. We'll catch you on the next one and on other stations though."

03:39:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:39:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

03:39:56 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

03:39:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:39:57 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:39:59 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

03:40:02 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:40:25 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:40:25 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:40:29 Lily Kaise stands up from your lap.

03:40:30 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

03:40:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:40:33 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:40:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:40:43 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

03:40:43 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:40:46 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:40:46 You're already standing.

03:40:47 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:40:48 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:40:48 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.

03:40:53 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:40:55 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:40:56 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:41:25 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:41:30 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

03:41:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:41:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:41:45 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:41:47 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:41:47 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:41:48 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

03:41:51 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:41:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:41:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:41:54 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: :;H`IJTz)MMc#K'#;*1^FU87Vq1%6m:E%WF(DWzy
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

03:42:24 Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

03:42:25 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 179,356.64 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

03:42:25 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:42:35 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:42:35 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:42:36 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:42:37 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:42:39 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:42:45 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

03:43:00 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:47:48 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:47:56 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:48:35 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:48:35 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

03:48:38 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Thank you for travelling all this way for your asteroid hauling needs. Please enjoy the supply of asteroids while they last. Beware of pirates, IFS, and other such hostile ships. If at all possible get ship class information when you report over tactical and land on one of the stations to be safe. To get home just travel back to Home beacon alpha 286. There is currently no charger available so if you plan to spend the night remember to power down your ship."

03:48:39 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:59:46 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:59:50 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:59:50 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

03:59:51 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

03:59:51 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:59:53 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Passively Beaconed Solar Autonav Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:59:53 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Solar Autonav Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

03:59:55 There are no other ships in the sector.

03:59:56 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

03:59:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:00:09 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

04:00:12 The starship transitions into another sector.

04:00:16 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

04:00:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

04:00:19 Starships In Sector:

04:00:19 
I'm No Angel............................(9, 15, 3)

04:00:20 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:00:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:00:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:00:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

04:00:23 You say, "Wait."

04:00:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:00:25 The two-person medium transport "I'm No Angel" has fired a grapple into a small comet.

04:00:26 Ships in this sector:

04:00:26

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

04:00:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:00:27 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as another starship is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

04:00:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:00:29 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

04:00:30 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:00:31 You say, "It is a pirate."

04:00:31 Lily Kaise asks, "Huh?"

04:00:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:00:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:00:36 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

04:00:37 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:00:38 You say, "I was scanning that transport."

04:00:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:00:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:00:40 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:00:41 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but we're not going to fight it in this."

04:00:41 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

04:00:42 You say, "But I got it."

04:00:42 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:00:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:00:45 You say, "I know."

04:00:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:00:45 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:00:48 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

04:00:50 You say, "Not in this."

04:00:51 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:00:54 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

04:00:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:01:07 Lily Kaise asks, "Well go back and get your sout ok?"

04:01:14 Lily Kaise asks, "Scout?'well go back and get your sout ok?"

04:01:18 You say, "Sure."

04:01:20 You grin.

04:01:22 Lily Kaise grins.

04:01:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:01:28 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:01:30 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:01:32 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

04:01:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:01:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:01:44 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:01:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:01:45 Lily Kaise glides out.

04:01:46 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:01:47 You scramble to your feet.

You can go northeast, southeast, and up.

04:01:49 Some lights on the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" flash as Lily Kaise boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

04:01:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:01:51 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:01:52 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

04:01:53 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

04:01:55 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:01:58 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:01:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:02:02 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:02:05 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:02:10 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

04:02:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:02:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:02:25 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:02:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:02:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:02:52 Lily Kaise joins your group.

04:02:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:02:53 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:02:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:02:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:03:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:03:08 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:03:09 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:03:14 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:03:20 Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.

04:03:20 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:03:26 Lily Kaise is already in your group.

04:03:33 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Hello Kim,
Shule and I are following in the convoy to Andy's which leaves tomorrow at 0200. At this time, we don't plan to return with Johann and Sean as we want to go to an artifacting field near Tom Town called Sea of Fears. SEAS has nearly 1500 Exploration so we'll each artifact to add to that balance.
While we're away, as of this date and according to the Range Office, the Asteroid Processing station in Alpha 285 will go offline in just under 5 days and the Salvaging Station will go offline in about 9 days. I know we won't be back before the Asteroid Processing station goes offline and may not have returned to deploy the replacement Salvaging station.
We'd really appreciate your assistance with deploying the replacement stations. I have built both stations aboard Herding Cats, my constructor so all that needs to be done is to fly the constructor out to Alpha 285 and to deploy each station when needed. I have enclosed a key to Herding Cats for you to use for this purpose.
Thanks for your assistance and we'll be more than happy to return a similar favor when needed.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived
at Famous Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long
time since we drifted off course en route and it required about
another day to get our bearings and to correct our course. When
melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would likely want
to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back
in Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to
prepare a written statement as well albeit I didn't ask permission
to do so but I really wasn't given the time to ask very many
questions.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda into the Control Room of the ship and the
exchange began like this. I asked? 'so Melinda do you have a
letter from Nissi?
Melinda Michaels says. "I do not, she is, um, unavailable."
Melinda then says, "So we are running without either voice
currently."
I nodd to Melinda.
I then asked Melinda? 'so who did she appoint to act on her
behalf?
"She did not appoint anybody," Melinda says. "I took it upon myself
to come out here and make sure you guys knew."
I then said to Melinda. 'well first off, I want to thank you for
your efforts in traveling out here.
Melinda next said. "Since she is not available, I will probably
take it upon myself to send whatever letters are needed," Melinda
says. "Somebody has to."
I then went further to state. 'Second, I want to express that i am
very troubled by the news. However, do consider that crime happens
to all citizens of all alliances.
'I am not happy with what has occurred.
Melinda then nodded in agreement.
I then said to Melinda. 'Still, I am not the Military. I am not
the aEU Government. My job is to be a messenger to our Government
Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and nothing more.
I added with another question? 'So too, did Ather Jammoa send you
here?
"Nobody sent me," says Melinda.
I then said. 'ok well Akemi was acting rather hysterical saying
that I was wanted back there so I'm just trying to understand who
wants me back there.
Melinda, obviously not hearing my question says. "You are the
voice," says Melinda, "troubling times are at hand and here I am."
Melinda says, "We want some kind of word, people are getting
upset."
I responded with. 'yes but if our government felt I should be
there, they have the means to dispatch that request to me. I
informed them before I left of my plans as well.
Melinda asked the following which I hoped would be a good faith
effort on her part to convey my need for clarification. "So," asks
Melinda, "this is what you want me to tell people if they ask?"
She cut me off you see as I wasn't finished with what I had to say
which was. 'Even if i were there, I am not the party who can
control the behavior of aEU citizens.
Melinda says, "Of course you can't."
She continued with. "So, since you weren't asked for in an
official capasity, you will remain on said trip," Melinda says. "Is
this correct?"
I concurred by saying. 'well it's very much out of my hands. They
need to understand that it's not within my power to control AEU
Citizens. It is our government's responsibility to deal with those
issues. You can certainly convey to them in o uncertain terms that
I am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical over-
emphasis on the partof the media and related to recent elections no
doubt.
Melinda says, "Okay I will do this."
Melinda says, "All right."
Melinda Michaels then stood up to leave without repeating anything
back to me as well as she didn't let me finish what I was saying.
I just went on by stating. 'If I were back there, there really
isn't anything I could do.
Melinda then says, "I just hope nobody else dies."
She still wasn't allowing me to complete my statement. so I went
on to say. 'AEU pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to
me as well.. "That's fine," says Melinda.
Melinda says, "I tried."
'Thank you for doing so.
Melinda waved. Then she says, o very unceremoniously, Melinda
says, "Yup."
Melinda says, "Later."
I waved back rather amazed that she seemed both not interested in
what I was trying to gather from the scant information I had as
well as nothing official from the leadership from the league nor
Ather Jammoa or from any other AEU pilot back in Comms.
Melinda Michaels then rather rudely walked out. There is certainly more that I would like to have discussed or to have asked if I could prepare a written statement or even asked for a brief period of time to consider a request which didn't come to me in an official capacity. Still, I would have. I took time to consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the AEU seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann in his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went on to Tom Town to charge overnight. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship was charge onto Sea of Fears the next day. After a rather sleepless night, when I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and very apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at Sea of Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better grasp of the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann was very gracious and he
said that he understood my concerns and that we could return to
Comms. Since there was no other means aboard Johann's Galleon to
communicate that we were returning, it is unfortunate that a hasty
decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf. I further find
it regretable that Melinda was in so much of a hurr
11:36:15 y not to allow
me to prepare a written statement which I couldn't have prepared
before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on. I apologize
to you all though as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation was in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the plans of
others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that Ather Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't have hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison office.

Dear Mr. Lambeth,
I am providing a statement to you below which concerns my interactions with Melinda Michaels after she arrived on Famous Andy's Trading Post whereby she demanded my return to Comms. In addition, i want to share my own perspective and that I never absolutely refused to return to Comms.
I am very sympathetic to others and especially when the news related such horrific crimes towards humanity, why, then didn't any of our own pilots support this? It seems that they only did so when it became apparent that it was a problem for the AEU and i didn't act immediately on Melinda Michael's request.
Also, i want to point out to you that Kim Saunders who you have just appointed as Voice of the Corps, yesterday evening, related confidential information which was posted on our AEU Debate board over the General Channel concerning what I wrote. Kim Saunders often confides in Melinda Michaels and others from the League rather than to her own allies. How can we possibly trust someone who is going to discuss every communication or otherwise which transpires on the AEU message boards or over the AEU communications channel? Since I'm not able to do so, I hope your office will, remind AEU pilots of the confidential nature regarding AEU business and other issues is and how it is to be treated confidentially and not shared outside of the AEU Pilot Corps. I certainly thought that this related to what is posted on the message boards within the AEU, discussions which take place on the aEU communications Channel as well as during meetings and other exchanges which are specific to the AEU Pilot Corps.
Thank you and please see below.
During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived at Famous Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long time since we drifted off course en route and it required about another day to get our bearings and to correct our course. When melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would likely want to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back in Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to prepare a written statement to send back via Melinda Michaels. However, I didn't get the opportunity to ask permission to do so. I also really wasn't given time to ask very many questions. After Melinda Michaels abruptly exited the Galleon, she went to the Bar and so I also went to the bar. Just as I was about to ask her if she would consider discussing the situation further with me as well as I also wanted to prepare something in writing, she bought food and then said her goodbyes.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda Michaels into the Control Room of the ship and the exchange proceeded. I asked? "so Melinda do you have a letter from Nissi?"

Since we were traveling with Johann in his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went on to Tom Town to charge overnight and Johann obtained an upgrade for his Galleon. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship was charge onto Sea of Fears the next day. I still tried to understand why I hadn't heard anything from the AEU. There were too many unanswered questions. After a rather sleepless night, when I noticed that Johann w
11:36:23 as awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and very apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at Sea of Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better grasp of the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann was very gracious and he said that he understood my concerns and that we could return to Comms. There was also no other means aboard Johann's Galleon in the way of a Quantum Entanglement Device to communicate that we were returning. It is unfortunate that a hasty decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf as I had every intention to do my job. I just felt that the League were controlling things without the AEU's involvement. I further find it regretable that Melinda was in so much of a hurry not to allow me to prepare a written statement which I couldn't have prepared before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on.
I apologize to you, as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation was in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the plans of others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that Ather Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't have hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison office.
As you can see, I never directly said that I wouldn't return. I didn't say a lot to Johann Rowan because if his being a member 
11:36:23 of the League, there were certain aspects which I didn't consider that he should be privy to. From my own personal perspective. I'm not insensitive to other individuals from other alliances but it seemed rather odd that the League were so intent on me when their own leadership isn't performing. I so wish that Ather Jammoa would have at least sent a statement or a request via the Hyperwave which we tried to monitor during the times they can be typically used to transmit from the Torus. I was also not aboard my own ship and didnt feel that i had total control over another pilot's vessel. Johann Rowan was, however very gracious and did openly indicate that it was my judgement call to return or not. Therefore, he is not to blame for the delay.
I want to state that I deplore any and all acts of intimmidation, violance, destruction of property or otherwise harm that has been inflicted upon any individual, regardless of which Alliance, clan or where they are from. If those acts which i have read about in the news are verifiable as a true representation of fact, I urge the AEU to take immediate actions to seekout, prosecute and punish those involved. No matter what has been expressed of others, I do not hate nor wish any harm to be directed towards any human being from any part of this universe. The AEU must absolutely uphold a zero tolerance to crimes against humanity or any living being for that matter.

Hi Love, I'm writing this because I may forget to ask? The current Salvage processor in 777 will go offline around 2245 on 12-25-2316. Unfortunately, I won't be available from around 2000 on this date until approximately 0200 on 12-26-2316. Will most likely have the station ready to deploy from Herding Cats though. If you're available and can deploy the replacement in Asteroid Alpha 285 around the time the current one goes offline, it would be a tremendous help. Otherwise, I'm sure that it won't cause much of an inconvenience to others if the new Salvage processor is delayed for a few hours. Thanks for anything you can do to assist. Love you, - Lily

11:36:56 Hi Lily and Shule,
I have just put up the new Starseekers scooping station. I am sorry that this was a bit later than you may have expected, but you will be happy to know that SEAS is in on it now. Please let me or Morris know whether you are happy with the megacredit income it gives you.
It will be up for 16 days regardless, and we can then see whether having you on the station is benificial to both of our orgs or not, so, please let us know how it goes.
Take care,
Kim

11:37:07 Greetings Melinda,
I discussed the Org rotation idea with Shule for the Grade 80 Debris Field. My concern was that during the week, I am only available for a few hours during the early morning from about midnight until around 0300. Then on Weekends, I am generally available some of the time. Shule won't be working much, if at all, during the first week in June. So we wouldn't want our rotation to occur during that particular week. Otherwise, I feel confident that I have Shule's commitment to back me up if our rotation turn occurs on a weekday or that the beacon chain needs replacement when I am not able to work.
So, ccount on SEAS to commit to a rotation slot to help to maintain the Grade 80 Beacon Chain.
With kind regards,
Lily Kaise

Kim,

Below is a copy of the letter I have just sent off to Sir Wellington concerning this Allied Pirate issue.

During the course of the salvage op event that many pilots partook in, there was an understanding. Mutuality pilot Pierre Louis as well as AEU pilot Eli Gray brought us some information. We were told that the Allied Pirates would steer clear of the area seeing as Mutuality friends were in the area.

Due to the large number of IFS and Outsiders in the area, Mister Kelsey says that he had a group out there ready to defend. The incident that I recall is the following: Myself, Morris Corlew and Nicolette Lawrence were salvaging. Jason Rat, Bryan Stout, Emily Ford, Damien Goss and Shule Elemmire were aboard the gunship. I believe it was my gunship, "The Storm Petrel." The issue is that Mister Kelsey believes a cease fire was broken when the gunship fired upon his area defenders. I was waiting in the neighboring sector with the op can so have no idea who fired first or anything of that nature. I do believe that this was the op in which they had to switch ships to, a pincer called, "The Wolves have Claws," so that AEU pilot Kim Saunders could be added to the defense. I also believe that most of the pilots thought the pirates would not be getting involved in ops but did not realize they wouldn't be causing issues otherwise. At any rate, I am inquiring as to whether or not we can find out who fired first on behalf of
11:37:15  the Mutuality pilots. I plan to ask the pilots aboard the ship about this incident as well.

The other incident that I recall was during the early morning hours, I saw a couple of pirates come into the sector. I did launch my corvette and they promptly vacated the sector. I did not fire and was not fired upon.

If the glyph at the door flashes black, we cancel it. If white, we match it. So if we get a red one, it'll flash black, flash a blue and a yellow. If we get an indigo that flashes white, we first make a violet glyph, then a blue one. If that indigo flashes black, we cancel it by making a saffron glyph (make an orange glyph, then add yellow).

Note - there may be some mistakes in spelling, etc here but I found these notes concerning Ifs.
Target priority for IFS beacons or invasions
For IFS, you basically want to take out the heavy hitters first.
Almost all of them are able to constantly hit you, and the quicker
you can reduce the rate of damage you're taking the better off
you will be
1. Hades. These just fire constantly and do a lot of damage.
2. Poseidons. Not as bad as Hades, but pretty bad.
3. Artemises. Basic long range attackers, they'll hit you
steadily but not very quickly.
4. Ares. Like Artemises but they can't take a hit.
5. Apollos. No long range attacks. Save them for last.
a few special notes --
Hestia - If you see one of these and you're not in a cruiser...
you should probably leave it to someone who is. They hit very
very hard and they can launch fighters.
Chronos - A very dangerous IFS flagship. Avoid unless you're a
very good pilot. Very good pilot is an understatement these are wicked to deal with and you will likely lose.
Deployment Apollos - These are about to drop a forward assault station.
But you have some time to take them out before they do. If you see
one of these jump in and you're nearby, drop your current target and
go after it.
This may be the Ifs that looks like a carrier.
Researchers weren't noted but I am pretty sure they would be targeted after the Poseidons and Ares are destroyed. I'm pretty sure you will s
11:38:26 ee Researchers mostly on a Beacon or you will see an Ares and a Researcher show up sometimes. I need to ask Ather.
Interdiction does occur and I thought it was the carrier class but when that Chronos jumped in on Blake's beacon that time we were interdicted. I was too busy to check all of the ships and since I was engineering, I couldn't access other details.

Shule, Just in case I fall asleep and am not awake by the time we're supposed to leave, please can you do the following? If you don't see the aquariums still sitting around in William Dove, put them all on a hoverpallet and take them with you? Also, the little pink bed is on a hoverpallet in the airlock of William Dove, please put it on your hoverpallet and take it with you? Also, all five pet felo are still in william Dove. Please ask Nissi if it's ok to put them aboard her Imperator as I do have food bowls for them and please keep those two bags of chow which I asked you to buy for them. I hope I will have managed to get the food together. If not, we'll have some day old pizzas and things and there is a vending machine which has food aboard the Imperator which is the same as the Galleon so we won't starve! I'll have Asteria with me. There's just a situation which may cause me to have to sleep unexpectedly. If I'm awake, I'll have taken care of all of these things. I just want to be sure that the fish aquariums which comprise yours and mine are taken along with us. If Nissi doesn't want the pets aboard, they will be fine in William dove for probably a few weeks as there's 15 bowls for 5 felo so even if Purr isn't around to mind the bowls, they will be fine. Also, Kim can put her pets in with mine in William dove if Nissi says no pets. I will still need to get with you to put the two robots aboard your ships. Again, hopefull
11:40:21 y I'll have taken care of everything. Just being precautionary. Hugs! - Lily

Shule,
I know Tatiana Krupin will seek you out now after our last two exchanges. I am copying in my final post to her below. Although I won't go out of my way to approach her, one aspect that she needs to accept is that she is not permitted to silence our outrage. If she can speak out, so should we be able to. I also wasn't harrassing her but applying peer pressure but it's without a doubt that she is beyond reason. I know too that you must be careful in your own approach with Krupin but as a peer, I can certainly express what I want and I have. If I were in your position, for professional reasons, I certainly would have to phrase differently. If you do ask her to resign it should likely be moreso that you remind her of our positions as holding a leadership role and how her own conduct is also scrutinized by other alliances and that our respective behavior can and will affect diplomatic relations. Of course this is up to you and you know exactly how to word it. If I wer her though, I'd much prefer to resign than to have the whole of AEU civilian pilots voting against me. This obviously doesn't phase her though. It's very surreal that reality simply does not register with this woman.
This is my very last post to Krupin -
Tatiana Krupin, I daresay that you have far more to deal with concerning your own reputation and behavior than I ever will. The reason why I disliked you early on was for behavior and arrogance exactly lik
11:40:32 e what you just exonerated through your recent actions. I am a reasonable person and if, for a moment, I felt that your case was valid, I would be supportive and this would be regardless of my own opinion of you. i believe in justice and your attempts to effect unfounded injustice towards our own who have endured far more than you could ever imagine, worked hardest for us, discovered wonders and are the very core of our Core vallue. You are truly a poor excuse for a human being and for your dishonorable abuse. You will indeed pay for your offenses against civilian pilots. I promise to be there to cheer on the judges. I shall speak to you whenever I so desire as well. You cannot silence me nor can anyone. I'll likely not waste my time with writing to you further however as you are beyond worthwhile of my time and effort.

11:40:49 --

11:40:49 Hello Takana and shule, I am concerned about how you both were treated by Joel Kringle today. If this was a practical joke, it's ok and I hope both of you are the better for it. If it wasn't, then please take any concerns such as these to our Voice of the Corps, Annie Lynn. While she can't force other pilots to treat you fairly, at least she is there to talk to and through her leadership, encouraging some level of fair treatment amongst pilots would be in order. Pilot life isn't the easiest. There will always be those who will are rude and treat more vulnerable pilots unreasonably. For you both, please don't let your guard down ever and be careful concerning what you say to other pilots, particularly to those who are not in our alliance and what you ask of them. Hang in there! - Lily Kaise

11:41:25 We have a couple of options or to do both:
Go to GMG
Or
go to Hall of Pain as shown below to artifact for Alien Artifacts as there's perhaps a week to ten days left on the stations along the way which I imagine are up for recharging purposes.
I have time available through Monday but Tuesday I'll not be working much except that i'll be around on a limited basis until about 1500 to 1600. Tuesday would be an ok day for traveling in the rift to or from Hall of pain provided you're comfortable with flying solo. i'd be around later on Tuesday between 0200 and 0400.
So we can go to GMG and then head for Hall of Pain sometime this weekend or so or go straight out to Hall of Pain and do GMG befor Tuesday or later next week?
Here is the Hall of Pain info --

Starseekers expedition Information
 
Hello,
I write this letter to you to confirm that you are on the crew list of the expedition I am organizing. this letter also contains some information about the trip.
 
- we wil be traveling aboard Akemi's science vessel, which she kindly has made available for this occasion. akemi will hand out keys just before departure. we will bring a few other ships along, keys for these will be handed out if and as needed.
- We will start gathering for departure on the first of June at 23:00 GST. we wil meet on Old Earth in the coffee shop. this coffee shop is located in the spaceport, between the landing pad and the south point exit. We are aiming for a departure time of 23:59 GST.
- You should be prepared for a trip that will take roughly 2 weeks. Melinda has made various food and drink dispensers available, but it might be nice if you brought a small amount of food for greater variety.
- to keep it fair for everyone, and to make sure we can bring a full crew, everyone is allowed to bring only 1 pet felo. If you choose to bring one, you are also required to bring a felo spacesuit for it.
- we will have a few crew members who have never been on an expedition like this. If you do not have any rift drive repair tools yet, do not worry. akemi has spare tools available and we will still have time to craft more of such tools.
- As of the time of this writing, the crew for this expedition is 
11:42:37 as follows: Akemi, anfisa, Melinda, Lillian, shule, Lily, Nissi, Liam, Michael, Blake, simon, Nathaniel, Morris, Sakura, Zandria and myself. 
 
should you have any questions that I have not answered in this letter, feel free to contact me and ask. also if you are not sure you are still awake during the gathering and departure time, talk to me or Akemi and we will make arrangements with you.
I am sure we are all looking forward to a fun expedition, and see you tomorrow!
take care,
Kim (Starseekers founder)

Date -- 1/4/2317
Liam,
This is one more attempt to provide an accomodation for your organization on organization sponsored temporary space stations.
I have room for an Ejecter on a Salvage processing and an Asteroid processing station. The Salvage processing station is currently located in Asteroid Alpha 285 and alternates with Artifact Alpha 777. The Asteroid processor is located in Asteroid Alpha 285 and provides fairly consistent Megacredits and an occasional Command point as well as reasonable cash flow. The Salvage processing station will expire early Saturday morning or 1/7. The replacement will be placed in Artifact Alpha 777 which has grade 20 to 40 Shipwrecks. This obviously isn't extremely high grade debris but pilots do find there is a consistent occurance of grade 40. Still, alternating the salvage processor is an experiment to determine which of the two areas pilots prefer for obtaining salvage. Therefore, for the time being, we plan to alternate placing the salvage processor between Artifact Alpha 777 and Asteroid Alpha 285.
I am enclosing a key to my Module Transport, Building Capital. We use the least expensive Ejecter which is the Unmanned Pickup. These cost one Megacredit or 5 million EAOS credits. If you would like to participate, please place 2 to 4 of an Unmanned Pickup ejecter module aboard Building Capital and we will accomodate Eternal Freedom. At this time, I don't have another organization who i
11:43:05 s seeking a slot on these stations and if I don't obtain parts from Eternal Freedom, then one organization will have to double up on providing parts which works but unnecessary duplication.
Best regards,
Lily Kaise

11:47:48 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed.
