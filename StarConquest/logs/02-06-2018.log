-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

01:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:56 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:56 Board what?

01:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

01:56 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:57 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

01:57 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked. A small light near the hatch is dark and unpowered.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:57 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:57 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:57 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:57 You peer out...

01:57 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Oblivion" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

01:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:57 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:57 The ship is already moving.

01:57 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Oblivion" has launched from New Earth.

01:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:57 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:57 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:57 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:57 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:57 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:57 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:57 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:57 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:57 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

01:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:58 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:58 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:58 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:58 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:58 You scramble to your feet.

01:58 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:58 You exit the ship.

01:58 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]

01:58 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:58 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:59 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:01 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

02:05 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

02:05 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:12 You can't read a secondary pilot command access unit.

02:12 You put a secondary pilot command access unit in a leather briefcase.

02:12 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:12 1,852,161.80 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:00  6 February 2318 GST]
There is one board post.

02:17 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.
