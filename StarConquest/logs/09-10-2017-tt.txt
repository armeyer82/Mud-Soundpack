-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic

[AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl
Orbit is now online!
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
contributed to a new AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station in Olivia's Pearl
Orbit.
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its
many tendrils.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch
with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and
pushes it slowly away from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for
launch clearance.
Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight
control board.
The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove!
Welcome to The Torus!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's
navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship,
William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully
charged.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident lies down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think I dozed off,
sorry Constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't
sweat it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm
going to land real quick and see if that was even a merchant transport."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It looked like one."
A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims
around a plastic flower with red petals.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've
never seen an EAOS one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Right one. I saw some
earlier today actually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hm, it's
not at the pad. Maybe its journey concluded here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, must have. Strange
place for an EAO transport to end up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Say, I
was just thinking, you don't think there's a way to entice merchants to leave
using a message beacon, do you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like
what if the message beacon asked them to leave for their own safety."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't nkow. I mean we
sorta tried that before. But it can't hurt."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I don't think that
will work, no. When we use the pregroamed transmissions it comes as a specific
signal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah,
okay. I figured."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
I'm drinking at Cicero's in between scanner beeps."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Bikura."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders

Shine the big white glowing felo rubs up against a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, purring softly.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It
totally works."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
question is, would that have any further-reaching implications."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like
would navy ships see that signal and jump out?"
Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, so
I tried packing the message into a larger one about not trading in our ports."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which
didn't work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So the
message has to come on its own."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But
maybe we could set up two beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Actually, punching that in as the text message might just be getting recognized
as the standard signal and transmitted as such."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So
message beacons might not be capable of transmitting it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I
wonder if there's a way they could be made to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ti's possible, though
when I tried to type it out myself in the sector, it didn't seem to work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I just
did it twice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe
when Lily's around we can ask her if she'll test it on one of her beacons."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah. I'd like it if she
changed the Riverway one myself. It's kinda funny, but funny isn't really what
we need."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils

Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is
that creche fund closed off now?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I took it all and put it
into a chip."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The folks didn't trust
that anyone could withdraw from it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
okay. I'll send you some bread to add to it later."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've
been meaning to contribute."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Not like
I need my billions to buy cool ship upgrades."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So I'm going to try and
either just purchase a bunch of creches directly and send them off to medical
centers across the worlds. Or if that's not a viable option, ew'll put it in an
account that pays for people to use the existing creches."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That
sounds good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Using pilot money for
things is tricky, but since it's a humanitarian donation I'm hoping it will be
different."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I
hadn't thought of that."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
in from the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And.. well, we're usually
supposed to go through the liaison office for stuff like that too, but I don't
particularly trust the crooks currently running our government."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So if I get in trouble,
it'll be fine as long as the creches or otherwise paid for medical care gets to
the people it needs to get to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't
think of that either, but I think you're right not to trust them. They would
probably just say they took the initiative to take something the pilots have
been keeping to themselves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And i'm making sure that
ti's on bhalf of civilian pilots."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. on behalf."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah I was actually
just transferring a donation from Lexie, did you want to donate something? We're
already got a butt ton more than I would have expected."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure,
give me a sec."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that
going to be enough? Do we have a rough idea of what this is going to cost?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, just getting as much
as folks will give I guess and then using it to try and do something about the
creche issue."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Anything
better than nothing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And
they'll need those creches if the Outsider's come knocking after we leave the
Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You should use the
terminal, and perhaps see if you can get a donation terminal set up that Voice
can set donation funds on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We have that one box, but
maybe there's something better we can have. Something you can actually set up
like a voting machine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Good
idea."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So
here's a dumb question, how did you have the fund set up before? Did you just do
it at the fund center ATM?"
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
in from the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So if
I'm understanding this right, the fund center terminal lets anyone open a fund,
but the funds in question are accessible to anyone, for both donations and
withdrawals?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can set it to
alliance, private, or set it to certain people."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay. So
what functionality do I want to ask for in our special fund machine."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
south.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I notice
that the donation box fund is different from the funds I see at the fund
center."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So you
are just thinking I should ask for a way to set anything I want to collect
donations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Just a machine that lets
you set up a donation fund for whatever we need to donate for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
okay, funds don't let you set people who can only deposit and not withdraw."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Making
the donation box special."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I see
now."
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself
through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its
claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh damn,
I didn't realize the planetary surveyor was a farport upgrade."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think you can actually
get it on the Torus now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
okay. I knew they sold probes at least."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's
good to know."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a
yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Torus confirmed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's also some real
great racks on the Torus."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was
thinking my plans to set up an exploration ship were basically ruined by the QSA
thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Racks?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Like,  real big racks.
Bigger than you can even believe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They are a bit ruined to
have some very useful things at the moment. But doing a bare bones expidition is
just another way to say fuck you to Best."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
figure I won't be going very far, but no reason I can't use the tech available
to go as far as I can."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I may be joining you soon
enough... I have a cuople of mor eplans but after that well... It will have
either had a big effect, or none at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And at that point.. I
don't know Constantine.. I might be through."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I can discuss plans with
you in a bit to see if you want to participate, but I doubt that you will, if
I'm being honest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
I'd like to hear them all the same."

Ather jammoa,
You are certainly are assuming a lot. Eli asked me if I would be available at
20:00 on the 4th and I affirmed I would be. on the 4th at 20:00 and he did not
call to organize nor did he anything additional and I was available and ready.
Eli didn't notify us of his change of plan so that I could have at least let him
know I wouldn't be available but for about an hour on the 5th and I wasn't
available for but about a similar amount of time earlier this morning. I had
asked Shule and Constantine to keep an eye on the Range office for the temporary
stations we support. Shule, for personal reasons, isn't working much right now
as am I not able to work but on a limited basis particularly during the weekdays
and weekday evenings. I have no idea why Constantine didn't take care of his
assigned duty as a Trustee for SEAS without properly notifying me. Otherwise, I
would have made other arrangements to have someone else deploy the Beacon as it
went offline while i was away. So on the 5th and earlier this morning, I
couldn't be available. I will have some time around 22:30 this evening and will
sho if I can come into work sooner.
So, this has nothing to do with a willingness to support our cause. I know that
some would be just as angry if I didn't put up their Beacons and related but I
made a commitment to Libertarians maintain certain stations. Johann has not been
happy when i couldn't immediately deploy other stations at times so the pressure
was coming from more than one direction Ather and not that I really wanted to
spend the little time I had in the Rift. As I so would have rathr been there
with you and Eli. So did you ask all of the others why they weren't there?
Communications are key if you want to organize for a cause and especially this
one so Eli or yourself were certainly not effective with letting us all know
when to assemble and especially that the original time was postponed. Given my
own limitations, I for one was very sad and disappointed that we did nothing on
the 4th when this was originally planned. I have already been supportive through
being on hand for Eli's public broadcasts when I could. I have personally chased
off traders and supply ships and will continue to do so. I will also, as I said,
be on hand for as often as I can to protest or otherwise.
I was hopeful that the trip out to 777 wouldn't require as much time as it did
and I had to leave while the ship was in the Rift for most of the time so it was
flying on its own and obviously at risk but it was the best I could do.
I'm sorry that you have been so judgemental. It's obviously true that you and
Eli are indeed placing hostile pressure upon AEU pilots as well. Think about
your behavior and your own actions Ather. Also, ask questions before you make
assumptions of others. If you want others to be available, notice needs to be
given or other arrangements which were notified to us should follow through as
well. For shyer pilots, you are likely intimmidating them and this is not the
right time to behave in this manner as we need to work together but you are
already causing hostility amongst us when we need to come together and be
supportive of one another instead. So this is not a rant. It is merely an
expression of my disappointment in you Ather Jammoa.
As for the revocation of other organizations to SEAS Warehouse, it's
disappointing. However, I have such little time to be at work, that the
responsibilities often don't afford me much time for anything else while I am
able to be here and I am currently not seeing others stepping up to assist.
After their respective modules are depleted, I will revoke other organizations
access to SEAS Warehouse in kind. If they want assistance in the future and
restore SEAS, then we will return their status.
This letter will be distributed to all Organization Founders.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not
sure if they respond to those transmissions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, that would be
bad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not
even sure this is even doing anything. A day or two after we started, there was
a headline about trade being down 7%."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We've
heard nothing since."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What did you do with
your belt personell? Are they still working for you? Or didn't you have any to
begin with?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've
done nothing with mine yet. Some are still paying them, I think. As long as you
don't collect points you don't contribute anything, I believe. But confirm that
with Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If you
want to stick to the strike rules, that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Unfortunately I
collected a few weeks back while I was here for a day, not realizing the strike.
I will not do that again though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh
yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, no
worries."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do not believe belt
points make a big impact or help our economy much. A load of salvage would be
much more useful to our government than that, I would think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's
probably true, we're just been trying to completely shut things down."
A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Of
course we haven't come close."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yep. I understand."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
strike has been on for a month today, actually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Whoever came up with
the idea of those temp stations, I do like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli and
I built the first three a long time ago."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We let
them sunset without replacing them because we didn't feel they were doing much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I also
feel like we were discouraged from doing it by a few people."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily has
set these up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I get it. Well, maybe
we should build so many they get a bit harder to ignore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
originally we set up one in each hub sector."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Providence, Riverways, and what not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It might
make more of a statement to have one in each planet sector."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That
gets pricey though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At least
for me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, I can spare
quite a few credits, and Starseekers certainly can."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well I
just confirmed that the navy doesn't care about the standard leave the sector
transmission."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So when
Lily wakes up I may ask her to experiment with one of those beacons to see if it
can transmit one."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a
plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when
it can't break the toy.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess
I could do one now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, you also got a
capsule?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah,
I use it mostly to move quickly to the bubble."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No more
capsules for us, though. Now that we've lost QSA access we can't buy anything at
farport, I don't think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, yeah, I never did
that, because leaving ships there never seemed like an idea I'd like."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
it's not the most ideal solution, but it does save me time. Before the strike I
was going out there every day."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a
sienna glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Losing QSA access is
bad on more fronts, what do you think about GMG? A ton of exploration upgrades?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
losing that stuff is a serious blow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
haven't been to GMG yet and now I don't know when or if I ever will."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wanted
to lead an expedition next term, and I will, but my range will be limited."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "In the
wake of the negotiation meeting, I collected statements from all the pilots that
were involved."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Including the Mutuality pilots."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We're
not getting access back any time soon, basically."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Why did it fail?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The Negosiation?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
it failed for a few reasons. We basically had nothing to offer them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
what they really wanted as an offer was an assurance that our navy wouldn't use
the QSA to attack them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which we
don't really have the authority to offer."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a
yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
cool!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What is, my
constructor?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
thought it was a beacon at first."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is not really
mine, but Starseekers's."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man,
if this works."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That
would be so great."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Proof I have not done
this in a while."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon at New Earth Orbit

A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils
and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings
itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it
withdraws.

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "No one is
doing anything? Someone must have an idea!"
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo jumps down from Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's lap.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm,
okay, he went to Hoyt. The beacon wouldn't have transmitted when he launched,
right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So we
have to just hope he comes back to New Earth orbit. He'll probably go to
Endymion though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I
should set one up in Endymion orbit to test."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
let's see where he goes."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a
violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic
kelp.
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Want to
grab my clipper?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Not very effective
though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What's
not?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "A Clipper."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh sure
it would be. Why not?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Rats do a lot of
damage and it has no one in engineering with 1 gunning and 1 flying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well
want to use one of your ships? I don't have any 2-person ships."
A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles
around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay,
got a full repair, should just take a few seconds."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "We might
inadvertently suggest that wea will make this sector unsafe for, everyone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And thanks for the
repair."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This is
true. I thought if it does work, we might set up two message beacons -- one to
say why we don't want trading, and one to say to leave."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But we
can run this idea by the others."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I just
wanted to test it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It
probably won't work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is too general
that way, not very specificly targeted, if you ask me. But yeah, we will discuss
it."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels
itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So why
did Morris quit Seekers?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, because he
wanted to try running an org himself, or so he said."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
that makes sense."
[AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon at Hoyt Orbit is now

A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself
through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it
doesn't work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, well, then you
can change it into a protest sentence, so many get to hear and see it."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee
dispenser here.

[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "What are these merry band
ships doing?"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably something nefarious."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Stuff we'd rather they
didn't."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "They're more
likely planning their next theft."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Feel free to
open fire, as long as you're not within Mutuality borders. In fact, I encourage
it!"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Unless they're in Mutuality space,
then they're probably just patrolling."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "But Ather, the felo are so cute
and cuddly! Especially when they've latched onto your arm!"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Fucking
adorable."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I heard they were pirates, so
i've been paying special attention when I see them on flight control. Any ideas
on what sector they could've jumped to from the museum? It's been one of their
favorites recently."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "If you're not comfortable
doing that. At least warn them out of the sector."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "One of the
league salvaging spots."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably Clarkson's Push, or
Masterson's Bend, or one of the adjacent beacons."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Probably salvaging along the
league's corridors along where they said."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "They've been hitting the Tesla
corridor a lot too."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Any idea where I could go to
learn more about intersector geography. I know relatively little, even after my
training."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's a shame we
can't fine-tune our interdiction technology to keep the medium transports in the
sector so we can destroy them, too."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Beacons book. Space market."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There is a
beacon handbook on the market, I believe."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Thanks."
[Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Go get 'em James. Be advised
though. I fyou fire on a transport it will jump out and call in backup."
[Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "There not in the two places
that were mentioned over general. They either jumped out, or went somewhere
else."
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yeah, be ready to run like
hell if you're not careful."
[Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Check your jump destinations,
there should be a couple of numbered beacons around there."
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There's a whole string of
beacons along that line. Go get that book that's my suggestion."
[Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'll keep that in mind."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm going to get that beacon
book, and read it to."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Do both."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "If you ever want to go after
the pirates, I'd be happy to join you."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I always see them when I'm not
in a good ship to pursue it. I usually warn them off unless I'm in something
where I have control of my weapons from the control room. I'm not acrobatic or
talented enough to run between two rooms and fire and fly and engineer all at
the same times."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I know what you mean. I've
practiced with the cruiser simulator on AFW Command."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "This is grandly
useful skill to possess."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Thinking about Kelsey gives me
headaches."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh, I wouldn't
necessarily recomend doing it on a cruiser."
tra gen Agreed Ather.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Agreed
Ather."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Gunship or
smaller."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'm getting there at some
point Ather, but I am not that confident yet. I still get my ships blown up when
I try to fly them in combat with multiple enemies, so I wanna try and focus on
one thing first."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well, I didn't know better,
and it did give me a feeling for what that would be like, and why it isn't wise
to do something like that in a cruiser."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I don't have general unmuted. What did
Ather say?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I need to practice flying
again honestly. But I am not doing that tonight."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Mmm. Flying. I wonder how much
I've lost..."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "What."
'We're talking about running between rooms during combat and how it's a good
skill to have, but not to practice it in a cruiser.
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, in ships."
You say, "We're talking about running between rooms during combat and how it's a
good skill to have, but not to practice it in a cruiser."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You never stop
losing ships."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "We're at war on
multiple fronts."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I can't find a book on beacons
at least at the market on old earth."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I know. I just need to get my
good night's sleep. My ship. And a capable crew."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "James try a bookshop in one of
the cities then. It's still available, I know we had it in one of the fringe
bookshops on chetumal."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Oh, that's what I'll occupy
myself with. Anyone feel up for Tesla?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've never been, but I may
have just enough credits to register."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Can you wait a little while
I'd like to get this scoopful."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "20 million EAOS
credits."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I know."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Scooping should also go on my
list of things to do."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Scooping is the
second best industrial activity."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "It's pretty ace."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In any case. I'm about 30 or
40% full on this run, so I shouldn't be too long."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Want me to pick you up in my
gemini since I need to go and get mine anyway?"
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I can head over myself. What're
you in?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Fringe 1.5."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm also in fringe, tier 1."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Hmmm."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yeah, not ideal."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Tell you what. What are you
in? If needbe I'll make the supreme sacrifice and go get an AEU suit."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras coughs.
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Your maternal
figure."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I know."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Seeing about switching to a
League."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "We could still probably use
the AEU though."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "You bet they're headed to deal
with pirates?"
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Remind me, other people who know
better. Is tier 1 to 2 Tesla doable without a League?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Depends on what
suits you're taking."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "It is but it hurts like a
mother. I did it with a fringe 1.5 and a AEU 1 but we popped and it took us two
runs to do the squad leader."
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Pirate transport in orion."
[Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Understood. Shoulder, or
belt?"
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Belt."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Current outline would be Fringe
1, Fringe 1.5, and Rental 2."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Iffy but possible."
[Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "On the way."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Heh. I could switch to my Tier
One Syrup suit."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Heh don't."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles. "If I took more than one my
ship would probably attack me in protest."

want one but can't necessarily afford them on their own."

happened to that pet because they went away...yeah."

Outsiders and was nearly destroyed."

some really pissed off outsiders visit us."

it's gonna be great."

thanks again. I'll do a great job. Spread the word!"

they were lying to them, but who knows."

making a movie."
[Hyperwave Relay] Damien Goss transmits, "We're almost home Morris. Sorry about
your ship."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I think you have to do that from
the relay station. I can do it though, I'm already there."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Goss...I don't think we put
a relay on that station, so you'll have to go yell at him from the hypercaster."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Or it would go through if the
Torus was activated, hence why I tried cause I didn't know if it was rented for
this time period."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Valid point. I forgot the
obvious."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Message relayed."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Thanks."
[Hyperwave Relay] Unknown Contact 224524683 at South and Very Slightly Up from

[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Just to retrieve my ships."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've heard about the salvage
opp."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Should I tell them when they
should expect y'all back?"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Five hours give or take."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Probably 90 minutes for
me."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Did you all see any allied
pirates out there?"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "I have not, but I haven't been
out there much."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Pretty sure we saw some
Lambdas once at least."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I mean the merry band
people."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Oh, no, not that I saw."
[Hyperwave Relay] Unknown Contact 224524683 at South and Very Slightly Up from
the Torus relay transmits, "Ok. Is Mel bringin the other folks back or Goss?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I have a political question
about the merry band. Are they officially protected by the mutuality? And if so,
does the league's alliance with the mutuality council effect our policy towards
these pirates?"
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Tanny, if you are still
there, let them know Goss is bringing us back."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Tanny, it's gonna take Goss
5 hours to get out there."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Not that he is leaving in
5."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I don't think protection is
what you'd call it."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Then, what's the more
appropriate term for the relationship between the mutuality council and the
merry band?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "They said they'd abide by
the free port doctrine and the mutuality said okay good."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Oh I see."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Isn't Kelsey part of the Tandem
Pact now?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Mutuality is just part of
the Tandem Pact. Mutuality isn't the boss of everything."
peer out
Not much to see out there.
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Not that I'd mind it."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Not what I meant in my
question, it's just that yesterday someone said they were fare game to shoot at
unless they were in mutuality space."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "If that's your relations
with them, then whatever."
[Hyperwave Relay] Unknown Contact 224524683 at South and Very Slightly Up from
the Torus relay transmits, "Got it. Thanks. Things ok back home?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "And yeah don't shoot them if
they're in our space, that's bad because they belong there and a lot of other
people would get mad."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Understood. I just wouldn't
want to do anything to jeopardize my alliance's alliances."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I mean, I'm not telling you
what to do but incidents like that can get bad."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "But anyway, if somebody
shoots at you, you have the right to defend yourself."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've seen them jumping around
in League space, and even warned them away from orion once yesterday. They seem
to like salvaging."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Yeah they do that."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Even pirates need
resources."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Salvaging isn't bad."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I mean it's not aggressive."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Nah it isn't, but I'm always
curious when I see known pirates jumping around through my alliance's space."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "They do it everywhere."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Pretty cocky."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So this is probably not as funny as
I thought it was, but one time Ijumped into Farport and the guys were like
"We're under attack!" And it was just a pirate transport breaking up a chunk."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well, you know what I meant,
I'm not claiming the presidency or anything. I've just noticed them more on
flight control in league space than anywhere else."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "You would if you have your
scanner tuned to your alliance only."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Hey Eli, I heard something
like that on the scanner once."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Yeah they're fucking taunting
us."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "My scanner picks up
everything, from fringe to league to eaos to aeu, and still when I have it on, I
mainly notice the merry band in league space. I guess I never have it on at the
right times."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well transports aren't
aggressive, that's all I can say, they're just doing some work."

of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

there?"

whenever I go to an AEU planet I think okay, who am I gonna piss off over here,
but I go anyway."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Or I did until Aisling got
attacked over there."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "That was a load of shit."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I bet they wouldn't have a
go at her if it was one on one."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They were doing htat before the
Tandem pact thing though."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The pirates, I mean."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And no, they would not have likely
gone one on one with Aisling, not if they knew what was good for 'em anyways.
That's why they just stood back and threw rocks like cowards."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Eli, how's it going?"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Hey Eli did you get my credit
chip?"
[General Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "Going as well as can be expected."

[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And on behalf of the citizens of
the Union, I thank you as well as all who donated."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Welcome."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What did they donate for?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "So, maybe a stupid question,
but can someone tell me the difference between hyperwave broadcasters and
quantum linked entanglement communicators?"
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Not stupid, one is text
based, the Quantum link one is, it can go further than a hyperwave broadcast
can."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "The Hyperwave has a limited
range, but can go pretty far, the QED can go anywhere without needing to be
directed, it just,  works, the hyperwave communication need to be boosted and
directed where to go, or the ywon't reach the target."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Think of the qe as
like...The way to make contact with a ship anywhere. the hyperwave is a bit of a
convenience, because you can talk directly to ships or stations if they're close
enough. A qe message takes ages, because each character takes a while to send."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "For example: sending even
the code H4, takes like 2 minutes."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "The QE takes forever as
well, so messages need to be shortened down as much as possible. Th Hyperwave
lets you communicate past communications range and pretty far, but it can be
intercepted by anyone with the tech to recieve them too, but it's more or less
instant, so no need to shorten messages."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "What would you say the tr g I
know about the intercepted part, I can hear moris's side of his comms from the
salvage opp, I think just on my ftl comm without trying."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's because what you're
hearing, is being bounced back by the torus hypercaster. It's the big mama
hypercaster that can reach further than anything we can build."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "How does someone use it?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The one on the torus can
only be used when it's being rented by an org. Or at least. Aimed at that time.
But when it's being used. Anything you say over your comms hyperwave frequency
will be heard."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And the stuff i'm not hearing?
Is that hypercasters from ships or temp stations?"
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "The stuff you aren't
hearing is from the Hyperwave station aimed away from the relay, likely."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Right now, you're only
hearing one side of the conversation because they're using a temp station
hypercaster."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sorry for the slow response Cheri,
I couldn't get to my communicator. While folks were out protesting they heard
about a problem with less fortunate citizens not having access to medical
creches. They spontaneously busted out into a fit of donations to help."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Haha, nice."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Stuff like that gives me hope for
humanity."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It was like a donation
flood. We all started tossing credits at Eli."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Has it increased at all since
yesterday's update Eli?"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's like get these people some
creches, shit."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We've got miracle healing beds, let
folks use 'em."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That was kinda how it went.
We had people running to machines to exchange credits, and donations flying."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And of course the Patriots have
only made it more expensive by reducing the government subsidies."
[General Communication] Eli transmits sarcastically "You know, because they care
about the citizens oh so much."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Reformers live in houses just
as big as they can afford."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, sounds like just as big
as they can afford with public funds."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee
dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee
dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We need to
get something going out there. Who's got a plan?"
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Sup."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I swear that's the only word I
ever hear you say these days."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "It's the song of my people."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "The only one?"
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "We're not super diverse."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "My work is done."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I thought y'all were going back
to the thing out there. Is that over now?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I haven't been over at all,
but I didn't see any ops in the last 24 hours."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Hello."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Oh, I thought you were one of the
people who got blown up with Damien."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nope, not me, last time I
found I wasn't awake enough when ops happened, so this time I didn't go, always
too quiet for them at this time of day."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Who got blown up where?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nasty sounding attack on one
of the salvage ops on the trip."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Nine Outsiders, lots of warpers,
and interdicted."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And I heard you were flying,
and I know how good an evader you can be, and that you would have tried to get
the interdictors if you could."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I don't know what warpers and
interdiction means, but it sounds really bad."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Interdiction means no escape."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Yeah, except we didn't know
exactly who the interdictors were. The rapid wouldn't leave off Johann's
transport and so we spent the first part chasing that fool around the sector."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, rapids have to go first,
they are a royal pain."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It was you and Johann, two of
our best for that kind of situation."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "We think however that the one
interdicting was the martial fighter. At least we were allowed to leave after it
was destroyed, but all the warpers were gone by then too, so we are unsure about
that point."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We seem to be seeing more and
more warpers."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Egil, to explain here,
interdictors prevent ships from leaving the sector by any means, and assault
warping is a nasty upgrade some Outsider ships have where they teleport right
next to you guns blazing."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "That's cheating."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Sure is."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Wait till you meet the IFS,
with their long range lasers."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Real fighters get up close and
personal, no less than a couple of kilometers, tops."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "More, even."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I wouldn't say things like
that if I were you, everybody has different ways of fighting."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I was just joking about
distance. A fist fight equivalent in space would still have the ships really,
really far apart."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Alright, let's see, what to
do..."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Tesla?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I can't do anything right
now."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Lame."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Tesla?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You need a battlesuit plus 20
million to register."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I can afford that."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Do you have a battlesuit yet?"
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I have a tier 1 AEU suit."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Cool."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Teslaworld, to explain further,
is a planet ravaged by crazy radiation and electrical storms. It also happens to
have valuable resources underground and a fuckton of tunnels."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Ohh."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "It's pretty neat."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm half dozing doing a mine
right now, so if I go quiet, you know why."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "How's the pay?"
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "We use our battlesuits to mine
those resources and do battle with illegal poachers who want the stuff for
themselves. Pay is decent and versatile, you get to choose whether you want more
points or more credits."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "And like many activities, the
more you do it, the more lucrative it gets."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Sounds convenient!"
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Even better, you can do it alone
or with others."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I get the feeling Tesla is one
of your favorite things."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "It's pretty great."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I'm also bored and tired and thus
prone to rambling."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad laughs.
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Informative rambling! Thanks."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on,
we're not even on the board! Let's do some piloting!"
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I know how confusing pilot talk
is at first, and there aren't a lot of people who take the time to explain all
the terminology and such to cadets."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "At least not in the middle of
conversation."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I appreciate it. There's a lot
to take in."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Have I asked whether you've done
all your SVP missions yet?"
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad laughs. "No, but Ted has."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I haven't yet, by the way."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "If you need help with any of
those let me know."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "...provided I'm not already
curled up in bed."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I will. I can't do anything
that needs even a bit of focus right now, though."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I'm taking you up on that offer
one of these days, though!"
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Kay."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "In that case, fuck being awake
right now. See y'all later."

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

sanity on a cupcake I was freaking out for a second. never mind me."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'll assume you had a good
reason."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And, you didn't think to bring
a smaller craft along to make your escape? It'd probably have been better than a
rescue pod."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They seem to think that they can
just ignore what we're doing, so I thought I'd give them somethign ot notice."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Pod rides. I avoid those
whenever I can."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It was a very short pod ride."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "At least it was a short pod
ride."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well it does get one's
attention."

all later."

[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You crazy regs."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Our goals are lower than they've
been in a very long time. Somebody somewhere's gotta be pissed about that.
Especially with all the ops going on."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Um Eli, there's only one
problem with this action."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I told Evangeline she could
teach me all about explosions. You apparently didn't get the memo."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh sorry, you're saying I should
have invited you to come watch?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yes among other things."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Oh, I thought you were going
to say something like shutting down the pilot corps, ending subsidies, something
like that."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sssh, cheri. Do'nt give them any
ideas."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's not the reaction we want."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well there is a danger."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I'm not saying that you are
wrong. You are surely right that there's risks we're taking over here."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "But then, there's always
danger."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And being in a war while the
Outsiders are just waiting for the right moment to take us all out is a much
greater risk."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Agreed. That's the part that
worries hell out of me."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well good luck with all
this, not much we can do without somebody saying it's a provocation."
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Rats fighters in orion, about
5 of them."
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'll come back with my
fighter once I have dumped this load of salvage."
[General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey."
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I must have missed someone
getting orion?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "But one thing I noticed was
on flight control they didn't even seem surprised when the ship blew up, so they
might be getting used to it."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hiya Hakeem."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well I have hit two small
plateaus, but neat nonetheless. I just cleared 1 k industry and 1500 aggregate."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nice job Lex."
[General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip cheers for Lexie Amarras!

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The advanced scout "Celtic Rose" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are
landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[MTTS] atherj: I am actually kind of disappointed that no one got the perfectly
plausable babylon 5 reference that I was using in my character's little joke.
[MTTS] usfolks: Just because our chars don't doesn't mean we don't!
[MTTS] Butchulla: I did, but I didn't mention it. It was glorious though.
[MTTS] atherj: Woo Sci-fi fans.
[MTTS] atherj: Anyone who watched B5 is totally OK in my book.

[MTTS] usfolks: It's been a long time.
[MTTS] Ulias: I've actually been trying to find a descriptive version for a

[MTTS] atherj: To be perfectly honest it's probably my favorite Sci-fi series
ever. Just because of the way it was so brilliantly done.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Apparently I must look it up.
[MTTS] usfolks: It was a very good series. I should go back and watch it all
over.
[MTTS] alc_71: It's a great series.
[MTTS] atherj: I was told that the ending was pretty much decided on right at
the very beginning of the series, and they tied everything together so
effortlessly and perfectly.
[MTTS] Butchulla: It's amazing.
[MTTS] something: How old we talking?
[MTTS] atherj: Nineties.
[MTTS] atherj: Well actually I think that the last episode of the series aired
in like 2000 or 2001.
[MTTS] usfolks: Part of why I need to re-watch it. I think I missed the last
season, maybe 2.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Yes, I think you're right, because I think it aired just
after I got Sky, in the UK at least.
[MTTS] alc_71: If memory serves, it was 2000.
[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Clearing dictors in the tesla
pipe, no ships here though."

"Pro-government supporter got stabbed on Hyperion."
[MTTS] something: I may have found an AD version.
[MTTS] something: I could be wrong, though.
[MTTS] atherj: I was always told that there was only like a couple episodes of
the first season described or something.
[MTTS] something: I found the entire first season in a single file folder so
unless it just stops half way through.
[MTTS] usfolks: That's quite possible, actually.
[MTTS] something: Which yeah.
[MTTS] something: It was clearly marked as AD though, so shrug.
[MTTS] atherj: Could have been the entire first season, who can know?
[MTTS] usfolks: Even if it wasn't, I'd mark mine like that. So would make sense.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Wasn't
there a headline recently saying Best had 73% approval?"

you relaly believe those?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And yet
this happens on our second most populous planet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, don't
forget though that's the same way the attack on Aislign was reproted on at first
too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder
if we should be trying to give a voice to the dissidents on Hyperion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er..
Aisling."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
can't rely on those surveys to give you accurate results. Even if the
participants were chosen at random, you don't know what the fuck the randomizer
could've chosen for you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And
if memory serves, they tried to make it look like it was Aisling's fault at
first, no?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah,
I agree. Clearly there are people who aren't being heard."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, all they
reproted on was tha ta foreigner shot somebody."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So it's
possible the Best supproter was being violent and the others acted in self
defense, but there's no way to really know."

season.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage

Aisling."

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Hello? Anyone
there?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im honestly a bit
unnerved about the lack of news about outtcord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
it's weird that it's been multiple weeks since van Dannikin was removed, and
nothing has been said about his replacement yet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
negotiations were supposed to end a week ago."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You
would think they would be in more of a rush."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Maybe Best is having
bureaucratic problems."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I dunno, I doubt many
people would want to be the negotiator for outcorrod, if Dannikin did what he
did, how would other possible negotatiors be feeling about this now?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Good
question."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't
know, I'm sure there are some people who might want to legitimately negotiate."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like
Kaisa Rebane, maybe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "She has
said in the past that we're getting a raw deal and should renegotiate it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
if there were a way for us to stay in she would find it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's the
clear compromise at this point, I agree."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We stay in,
but renegotiate the treaty is all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah but remember
she's opposing best. Best wants us right out. Its unlikely he'll chose her
unless he has no choice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sadly I don't think
there'd be anyway for us to legitmately manipulate what choices he has."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
if Best truly wanted us right out, we would just be out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How
could anyone force negotiations on us?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She means
from the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's
what I mean, too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like if
he legitimately had no intention of staying in under any circumstances, what
would be the point of negotiating?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Who
knows, though, I'm not in his head."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Best wants to kick
millions and millions of people from AEU space too, Con. People who migrated to
our space. I doubt he has second thoughts about leavig the accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Going
through this charade for no reason just doesn't make much sense."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well if we
pull out without negotiationg a withdrawl, then we are in violation."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er, without
negotiating a withdrawl."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But what
can an organization we're not part of do to us to get us back for being in
violation?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Stop
trading with us? If they're smart that's on the table anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Restrict
our navy movements to Union space? Again, this should all be part of the
Accord's plan for us if we leave."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I
don't know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's just
it, if we just pulled out and started doign whatever, we would still be
contractually part of the Accord and thus in violation of the treaty."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe
it's not for us to understand."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
but if we want out, why would we care about being in violation of anything?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like
what would they do?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Tell us
we can't have the benefits of being in the Accord? Isn't that the point?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not sure
exactly, but if we get out then the Accord won't get invovled unless we become a
threat to humanity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You mean
they might take their weekly money by force if we quit without negotiating a
withdrawal?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
maybe that's true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's
posturing, if I'm using that term correctly. They do'nt want to appear to be the
bad guy in anything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "You've got the right
term."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I consider posturing
basically political bluffing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's
interesting. You're right, but we definitely appear to be the bad guy in
everything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's why
they blame the corps for the Mutuality tensions too, and why they try to make
them sound liek super evil."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Interestingly, the Mutuality also blames the corps for that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well yes, but
not from the QSA thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
what I meant both Aisling's and Anfisa's statements highlighted that the issue
was that we had nothing of value to offer for access."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The most
recent tensions though, have been about that flotilla."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, the
QSAmeeting not going well was totally our fault, more specifically my fault
probably."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "As did
Frolov's statements, relayed by Anfisa."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, it
wasn't your fault."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "For sure, but
that's not why the Mutuality is on edge about war though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
the blame rests on Vernos or on me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't
remember if I had taken office by that point."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I dn't
remember, but I should have at least probably fully passed the torch on that one
to one of you guys instead of trying to coordinate it while doing the other
stuff. I certainly got some of Aislings messages mixed up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a
small matter, from the statements I collected, I doubt any agreement could have
been struck, or will be struck any time soon."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's
shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its
surroundings.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm pretty
sure I have an greement that would work, but I dno't think folks would go for
it, we'd have to all agree fully."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What is
it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably nto
something for comms."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. probably
nto something for comms."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Enacting
a plan as a corps that we can't discuss within earshot of the government?
Juicy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
I'd love to hear it sometime."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's just an
idea based on what I heard and what I read in those reports."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Some of
the statements allude to a plan of a similar nature."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, what you
said about the statements."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't
think that's going to work. I have to admit, I'm not 100% comfortable promising
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean
right now it works because they're the good guys and we're the bad guys, but
what about six months from now?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think
most of our pilots would be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would
wager that the League and Fringe don't need to promise anything for access."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
the problem is that they just don't like us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "For a
variety of reasons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I'm sur
ethey have their own agreemtns, just probably nothing like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. I'm sure
they have their own agreements, I mean."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think it
could be worded carefully though, to at least move closer to avoiding what you
are saying about the future."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And then
what if our government found out?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder
how they would take that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If I
were Best, I would fire the entire corps immediately."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Though
maybe he doesn't have the stones for that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's
worded carefully, they'd have to be willing to admit something their not willing
to admit to do anything about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll write
down what I mean for you in a bit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm,
okay. Is QSA access worth this can of worms, though?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'd
be happy to look at it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There you go
constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's
definitely somethign we should all have a meeting about first."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We need to
get something going out there. Who's got a plan?"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The plan is
striiiiiiiike."
[Tactical Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Did anyone call for beacons?"
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Long time ago."
[Tactical Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Ah, that's too bad."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks heavily and then dozes off.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's
shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its
surroundings.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I tried
sniffing around the garage but it smells fantastic down there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "My
morbid curiosity has instead fueled a desire for waffles."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You sure, you
can smell it if you take a closer look around."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's neck.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hmm, I
guess maybe someone cleaned it up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It must
have been cleaned."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And sprayed
with delicious waffle smell."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah man, I
still smell it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
this agreement is so general that I think it would be okay. I guess if they
would agree to it, I would."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It would
surprise me though. There are what, about half a dozen of us who are active in
any sense? We can't really promise what this implies."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This
would basically just be for their peace of mind."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I
guess if they're fine with, I'm fine with."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We need to
get something going out there. Who's got a plan?"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've got a plan,

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Now,
I do want to tell you something, Jacob. In telling you, I'm not expecting you to
participate, just understand the mindset of the pilots in the corps at present.
Most of us are on a full strike; we will not do anything except defend alliance
space from enemy invasions. I would encourage you to be on that strike with us,
but ultimately, the decision is yours. I understand how empowering it feels to
have your full pilot license and all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The
reason for the strike is to stop President Best's attempts to remove the
alliance from the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I understand. And I
think I might just join you on that strike. Even though I've always been told to
be productive in some way. I feel kinda weird if I don't do at least some form

the President's mind, then we can all return to full productivity in no time."

itching to do something. I'ts funny, because the alliance is probably going to
have quite a payday when this is all over."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I know what you
mean. I do hope that he changes his mind."

You're assuming quite a bit here Lily.
For the first thing, like I said, Ather asked the orgs to remove Seas. You can
go ahead and ask anyone you like.
We are an org, and so we did what he asked.
It was me who physically removed the parts from your warehouse, sure, but that
again, was going along with what Ather wanted.
Just because I physically removed the parts, doesn't mean I should get the blame
for this situation at all.
And do you honestly think after all the time and effort I've put into 777 that
I'd be putting it aside? Well you didn't ask, you just assumed, so let me
clarify.
I definitely plan to continue building, but I have managed to convince cats to
join this.
So if your concern is newer pilots, well it's going to be even better for them
now, because of the better speed getting there etcetera.
But you didn't think to ask, you just abused me and lost your patience.
Sometimes asking questions gets you much further.
Like I said, I have no drama at all with you as a person, or with the members of
your org.
So you can say I'm stabbing you in the back all you want, but that's not the
case.
I know that you clearly need to get your facts straight, and again, I'd be happy
to help you do that.
But name-calling doesn't get you anywhere.
I haven't called you one nasty thing after all you've said, and I could have.
But unlike what you seem to think, I don't have a problem with you.
But hell, if you thinking that makes your life easier, go ahead.
The fact is I'm trying to better 777.
But of course you didn't give me the chance to explain that.

Evenia,
All of the excuses for which you didn't bother to present justifications prior
to the current issues will buy you nothing. I raised issues in plenty of time
for you to justify caving into ather Jammoa who has lost a tremendous amount of
credibility and you also allowed him to back-stab me and SEAS. So how do you
consider that to be very supportive of someone you ... uh considered to be a
friend. None of what you claim has any credible sensibilities. So how did you
think I was to be able to put up the Transmitter, the Recharging Station, The
Watchtower in 777? Oh yeah, we can certainly afford the modules but LIBS and
SEAS agreed to work together and very little out there yields much income so
what you are trying to use as a poor excuse has no basis whatsoever. So when
LIBS quits, then good riddance. We won't have a Rift Inserter but we shall
survive without you being the two-faced and dishonest person you are. No thanks!
As for Cats, Melinda blows with the wind. If she thinks it's ok with the
bullshitters out there, she's cool with it. As you are now. Otherwise, it's not
so I don't trust her as far as I can toss this pull tab that I have in my
backpack for some silly reason!
Yeah now you've cozyed up to Melinda you will say anything and it's not
surprising.
You have lost all of my respect Evenia. I sure did admire you when you stuck up
for what was right rather than what someone like Ather Jammoa wanted because he
is excessively jealous of me for reasons that I would rather not relate right
now but mostly because of reasons of his own undoing. So it's this game of I've
fallen, so I'll pull down anyone who seems to possess anything akin to what I
once had. So it's been nice knowing you Evenia. Ifever SEAS is able to
participate with stations again, I won't give you access to anything we own.
You've already betrayed us. You are not trustworthy. If seas must put up their
own income-producing Temporary Space Stations, we shall and we've been planning
to do so.

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

Melinda, you apparently missed my prior post. Sometimes we can't be in more than
one place. I am just not able to work as much as I used to and if I'm here
during the early mornings at times at all, it's for a very short time. Last week
was one of those weeks when I was available on Monday, not long on Tuesday and
then not until the weekend. So below is what I said.
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure
the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen
needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to
circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there.
Unfortunately, i was unable to be on hand last week with the exception that I
was available on September 4th when eli said that this protest would begin that
day.
i apologize for putting up the Beacon in 777 but i was concerned that Johann
would be annoyed and it has nothing to do with personal preference.
i'm adding that Johann has called me before when I wasn't available to put up a
station. He denies that he was annoyed but that's not how his tone sounded so
that's just how it was.
I most definitely abhor what the WORST administration is doing to the entirety
of AEU citizens and especially to those who are from other Worlds and
Territories.
i was caught in the middle of wanting to be there for others and especially less
experienced pilots which was the original intent of Artifact Alpha 777 I only
had a little time and I couldn't be in both places at one time.
I certainly will continue to fight the fight to debunk Outccord when I am able
to. I will have time off and on over the weekend so if anything in the way of
new protest activities are organized, I'll be there!
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure
the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen
needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to
circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there last week.
i have done as much as I can to oppose Outccord. I have sponsored signs in
Providence and in Riverway. I have attended Eli's broadcasts whenever I could
and I have chased away Merchants when I could and will continue to do so. If
another protest occurs, if I am available, I will be there. If not,then just as
many other AEU pilots weren't on hand for their own reasons, then this is how it
is.
I apologize again but I but you also jumptd to a hasty conclusion based upon
what Ather said without knowing what i was really doing regarding opposition to
Outccord. Eli spoke up for me as well. So I know you will do what you will do
regardless of what I say.
If SEAS is never allowed on stations again, we shall build our own and yes move
on. We are qualified to obtain sufficient modules to build all of the
income-producing stations including Xenology. We would prefer to work with
others but when we have stopped Outccord, then if you all don't want to be
reasonable, then we'll manage. So in order to prevent the competition that you
all don't like, then common sense says we ought to work together.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both
biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist,
both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both
feet are left uncovered.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Apparently you missed the point. A simple apology goes a long way. You didn't
have to point fingers at Johann, Ather and Eli. I understand stuff happens so go
with it and stop putting blame on others. Anyway, no one person made this
decision. Since this issue had to do with the AEU, I am going to let the AEU
pilots make the call as to when work with you is continued.

Lily, I think the point you're missing here is that we all want you to just take
responsibility. Stop pawning it off on Eve (who had literaly nothing to do with
it and doesn't deserve your vitriol), Johann, Melinda, Ather, and whoever else.
All it would have taken was, "I messed up, I'm sorry." When I was a boy I was
taught about something called natural consquences. When we do something there
are always consequences. Some kids get whooped, but my parents believed in what
we do making its own consequences. What's happening now is exactly that. We're
not punishing you. You did this to yourself. And if you can own up to what you
did instead of blaming everyone else, it'll go a long way. You may not have sent
me one of your nastygrams, but I got to read it and read what was on the board.
Take some responsibility. Stop trying to spread the shit around and just admit
you screwed up. It would go a lot farther than maybe you think. Everything we do
has consequences, and you can't blame the word for what happens. Learn from your
mistakes. You'll be a lot happier that way.

Lily, I have never been annoied because a station wasn't put up on time. If I
ever ask it's to just make sure that it's being covered, and if not, then I am
happy to do so. In that regard, this protest was a relatively important thing
for everyone, but especially the AEU. I think anyone would have understood a
late station in this instance.
We would have loved to see you at the protest, and hopefully you are able to
make any future activities regarding Outccord.

Evenia is my assistant coordinator. We will be working together to keep stations
running as smoothly as possible and with as little issues as possible. She will
handle things when I am away and if both of us are away, you all will survive.
As always, if you have any station issues, gripes or changes you would like to
see made, shoot me a letter and we'll see what we can do to sort it out.

Hey there,
I just wanted to explain this station thing for Lily. I chose to make this
public because she took her rant public.
Lily, while most everyone was at the protest, something important for your
alliance, you were building stations. Some of us even took rock shots in the
heads by your all's crazy antipeople groups. So, while I don't care and don't
need to hear the why for's, you just weren't there, it's done.
An apology would have worked out nicely rather than trying to place blame on
others, which seems to be your pattern. Ather was very let down and upset by
your not being as at the protest, were we all. He threw it out there for you not
to be on stations and we all agreed. So, if you want back in on stations, this
is how I feel it works, put a real apology up on the public boards and we'll
talk to Ather. Yes, that's me making a demand but I don't think I am asking
much.
And one more thing, stop blaming everybody for what went wrong, it happened, you
didn't make it, suck it up and try to move on.
Melinda

Melinda, you apparently missed my prior post. Sometimes we can't be in more than
one place. I am just not able to work as much as I used to and if I'm here
during the early mornings at times at all, it's for a very short time. Last week
was one of those weeks when I was available on Monday, not long on Tuesday and
then not until the weekend. So below is what I said.
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure
the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen
needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to
circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there.
Unfortunately, i was unable to be on hand last week with the exception that I
was available on September 4th when eli said that this protest would begin that
day.
i apologize for putting up the Beacon in 777 but i was concerned that Johann
would be annoyed and it has nothing to do with personal preference.
i'm adding that Johann has called me before when I wasn't available to put up a
station. He denies that he was annoyed but that's not how his tone sounded so
that's just how it was.
I most definitely abhor what the WORST administration is doing to the entirety
of AEU citizens and especially to those who are from other Worlds and
Territories.
i was caught in the middle of wanting to be there for others and especially less
experienced pilots which was the original intent of Artifact Alpha 777 I only
had a little time and I couldn't be in both places at one time.
I certainly will continue to fight the fight to debunk Outccord when I am able
to. I will have time off and on over the weekend so if anything in the way of
new protest activities are organized, I'll be there!
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure
the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen
needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to
circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there last week.
i have done as much as I can to oppose Outccord. I have sponsored signs in
Providence and in Riverway. I have attended Eli's broadcasts whenever I could
and I have chased away Merchants when I could and will continue to do so. If
another protest occurs, if I am available, I will be there. If not,then just as
many other AEU pilots weren't on hand for their own reasons, then this is how it
is.
I apologize again but I but you also jumptd to a hasty conclusion based upon
what Ather said without knowing what i was really doing regarding opposition to
Outccord. Eli spoke up for me as well. So I know you will do what you will do
regardless of what I say.
If SEAS is never allowed on stations again, we shall build our own and yes move
on. We are qualified to obtain sufficient modules to build all of the
income-producing stations including Xenology. We would prefer to work with
others but when we have stopped Outccord, then if you all don't want to be
reasonable, then we'll manage. So in order to prevent the competition that you
all don't like, then common sense says we ought to work together.

Citizens of humanity, Outccord is currently on hold but it must be stopped
completely
If the Union pulls out of the Accord, it will weaken our best fighting chance
against the alien threats that want to destroy us
President Best wants people to think that the Union doesn't need the rest of
humanity, he even wants to kick folks out just for being born in other alliances
the Union pilots have been trying, but the one thing we haven't done is asked
the rest of humanity for help, or to show that they want the Union to stay in
the Accord
so, today starting at 20:00 we will begin protesting outside of the old AEU
headquarters, straight north from the New Phoenix spaceport
this is your chance, as members of other alliances, to come out and show the
citizens that you don't want the Accord to lose the support of the Union
Please come and join us, help show the people of the Union that we all stand
together
i will likely be staying at the site for a couple of days, I do not however
expect anyone else to do so. 
We can end this madness together if we try

The trip is delayed for a couple of days, maybe more. I will post again Friday
with more details. Sometimes we just have to put our personal work related
things away and stand up for humanity.

So, keeping all these temp stations and builders together might seem easy but at
times it can be a bit of a job.
I am looking for an assistant coordinator. Their job would be as follows:
1. stand in coordinator in the event of my absence for any reason. This would
entail both long and short absences from work.
2. Have the ability to discuss decisions that need to be made with me so that I
don't miss a possible solution.
3. Be willing to put personal views of others aside for the continued station
building work relationship of the organizations.
If you are interested, send me a letter by September 12th. Please explain why
you are interested and your station building experience whether it be none,
minimal, mid-range or extensive.
One final note, I do not usually just make big decisions on my own. Getting a
feel for what other organizations think is how I have decided to run the show.
You must also be willing to do that.
Thanks in advance,
Melinda

I have been informed that the op should be good to go. So, I will be leaving to
build this afternoon. People can decide whether to go out tomorrow or later
tonight. For me, it will probably be tomorrow. Or well after midnight at least.
Those who need a lift, holler. If people can't salvage that debris grade, which
is 80, they can go haul some roids, defend the ops and hang out in the lounge.
Note that we will be setting up broadcasters in case we are needed or people
just want to talk to us from home.

thanks to everyone who showed up to show their support for the Union staying in
the Accord.
I hope that we at least got through to some folks on the ground. We showed
people that the pilots of humanity stand together no matter what alliance we are
from
we also raised 14.5 billion credits to help get creche access to citizens of the
Union that don't have them. this was not part of the protest, however it was a
subject that came up during the course of it, and pilots of all alliances jumped
at the chance to help their fellow humans
I am filled with hope by the number of you that not only showed up, but stayed
so long to show their support. do not give up, Outccord still has not happened
and yet and we must do whatever we can to try to stop it.
we've all come to know each other a little better over the last few days and I
hope that we all continue to do so.
for now though, the protest is over. thank you all once again for coming out
May you all find peace and joy in your lives

Subject: Re: Say no to Outccord
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 01:58  9 September 2317 GST

I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure
the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen
needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to
circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there.
Unfortunately, i was unable to be on hand this week with the exception that I
was available on September 4th when eli said that this protest would begin that
day.
i apologize for putting up the Beacon in 777 but i was concerned that Johann
would be annoyed and it has nothing to do with personal preference as I most
definitely abhor what the WORST administration is doing to the entirety of AEU
citizens and especially to those who are from other Worlds and Territories.
i was caught in the middle of wanting to be there for others and especially less
experienced pilots which was the original intent of Artifact Alpha 777 I only
had a little time and I couldn't be in both places at one time.
I certainly will continue to fight the fight to debunk Outccord when I am able
to. I will have time off and on over the weekend so if anything in the way of
new protest activities are organized, I'll be there!

Lily, I have never been annoied because a station wasn't put up on time. If I
ever ask it's to just make sure that it's being covered, and if not, then I am
happy to do so. In that regard, this protest was a relatively important thing
for everyone, but especially the AEU. I think anyone would have understood a
late station in this instance.
We would have loved to see you at the protest, and hopefully you are able to
make any future activities regarding Outccord.

Evenia is my assistant coordinator. We will be working together to keep stations
running as smoothly as possible and with as little issues as possible. She will
handle things when I am away and if both of us are away, you all will survive.
As always, if you have any station issues, gripes or changes you would like to
see made, shoot me a letter and we'll see what we can do to sort it out.

Hey there,
I just wanted to explain this station thing for Lily. I chose to make this
public because she took her rant public.
Lily, while most everyone was at the protest, something important for your
alliance, you were building stations. Some of us even took rock shots in the
heads by your all's crazy antipeople groups. So, while I don't care and don't
need to hear the why for's, you just weren't there, it's done.
An apology would have worked out nicely rather than trying to place blame on
others, which seems to be your pattern. Ather was very let down and upset by
your not being as at the protest, were we all. He threw it out there for you not
to be on stations and we all agreed. So, if you want back in on stations, this
is how I feel it works, put a real apology up on the public boards and we'll
talk to Ather. Yes, that's me making a demand but I don't think I am asking
much.
And one more thing, stop blaming everybody for what went wrong, it happened, you
didn't make it, suck it up and try to move on.
Melinda

Melinda, you apparently missed my prior post. Sometimes we can't be in more than
one place. I am just not able to work as much as I used to and if I'm here
during the early mornings at times at all, it's for a very short time. Last week
was one of those weeks when I was available on Monday, not long on Tuesday and
then not until the weekend. So below is what I said.
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure
the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen
needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to
circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there.
Unfortunately, i was unable to be on hand last week with the exception that I
was available on September 4th when eli said that this protest would begin that
day.
i apologize for putting up the Beacon in 777 but i was concerned that Johann
would be annoyed and it has nothing to do with personal preference.
i'm adding that Johann has called me before when I wasn't available to put up a
station. He denies that he was annoyed but that's not how his tone sounded so
that's just how it was.
I most definitely abhor what the WORST administration is doing to the entirety
of AEU citizens and especially to those who are from other Worlds and
Territories.
i was caught in the middle of wanting to be there for others and especially less
experienced pilots which was the original intent of Artifact Alpha 777 I only
had a little time and I couldn't be in both places at one time.
I certainly will continue to fight the fight to debunk Outccord when I am able

circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there last week.
i have done as much as I can to oppose Outccord. I have sponsored signs in
Providence and in Riverway. I have attended Eli's broadcasts whenever I could
and I have chased away Merchants when I could and will continue to do so. If
another protest occurs, if I am available, I will be there. If not,then just as
many other AEU pilots weren't on hand for their own reasons, then this is how it
is.
I apologize again but I but you also jumptd to a hasty conclusion based upon
what Ather said without knowing what i was really doing regarding opposition to
Outccord. Eli spoke up for me as well. So I know you will do what you will do
regardless of what I say.
If SEAS is never allowed on stations again, we shall build our own and yes move
on. We are qualified to obtain sufficient modules to build all of the
income-producing stations including Xenology. We would prefer to work with
others but when we have stopped Outccord, then if you all don't want to be
reasonable, then we'll manage. So in order to prevent the competition that you
all don't like, then common sense says we ought to work together.

Apparently you missed the point. A simple apology goes a long way. You didn't
have to point fingers at Johann, Ather and Eli. I understand stuff happens so go
with it and stop putting blame on others. Anyway, no one person made this
decision. Since this issue had to do with the AEU, I am going to let the AEU
pilots make the call as to when work with you is continued.

Lily, I think the point you're missing here is that we all want you to just take
responsibility. Stop pawning it off on Eve (who had literaly nothing to do with
it and doesn't deserve your vitriol), Johann, Melinda, Ather, and whoever else.
All it would have taken was, "I messed up, I'm sorry." When I was a boy I was
taught about something called natural consquences. When we do something there
are always consequences. Some kids get whooped, but my parents believed in what
we do making its own consequences. What's happening now is exactly that. We're
not punishing you. You did this to yourself. And if you can own up to what you
did instead of blaming everyone else, it'll go a long way. You may not have sent
me one of your nastygrams, but I got to read it and read what was on the board.
Take some responsibility. Stop trying to spread the shit around and just admit
you screwed up. It would go a lot farther than maybe you think. Everything we do
has consequences, and you can't blame the word for what happens. Learn from your
mistakes. You'll be a lot happier that way.

Lily.
I am going to be quite blunt. the letters you sent to Evenia crossed a major
line. We are professionals, not junior high school students. Decisions made in
professional situations are not indicative of personal feelings towards
individuals. If you want to be angry at me, Evenia told me what she did on
Ather's behest, and I approved it. You can send me all the hate mail you want
because after I see the first one isn't worth reading, I'll just go camping and
roast marshmallows with the rest.
Regardless of future involvement by anybody, 777 will remain up for new pilots
to salvage and artifact, and Allied Libertarians will always be involved. If you
wish to go your own way, you are of course free to do so, but if Seas ever
wishes to work with Lib again, there will be an appology made to my station
coordinator, and a promise to at least be able to conduct civil discourse.
all the Best,
Johann Schraft, Allied Libertarians Founder

Morris,
You fail to recognize that theres a difference between natural consequences
and peoples choice in the way they react to something. I am sorry for feeling
the urgency that there was a beacon that had expired. It's a natural reaction to
feel the urgency that others depend on a beacon or otherwise and to rush into
action.
I don't know how else I can express that I'm sorry for making this choice. You
all do have your own agenda though as you would have recognized this in lieu of
my other very dedicated efforts to oppose Outccord and to express my outrage
towards the violence towards non-citizens of the AEU.
I apologize for chosing to do what I did but I felt caught in the middle of
feeling responsible for both situations. I didn't even know that there was a
protest going on as well until eli spoke to me over the AEU channel and I was
already en route. Yes I could have turned around as well.

Wow! What did I come back to? As AEU pilots hopefully knew, I have not been able
to be very active for about a week and a half. I understand that misunderstandin
gs happen and apparently, some drama took place while I was unable to be at work
consistently.
From my understanding, a multi-day protest against Outcoord took place on New
Earth sometime around the 4th in which civilian pilots from more than one
alliance participated. I applaud those who were available and took the time to
take a stand against such a terrible thing. Had I been available, I would have
enthusiastically joined those in the protest.
I would like to emphasize that from the very beginning of all of this, going as
far back as the first broadcast, taking a stand against Outccord has been a
highly encouraged, but ultimately volunteer affair. I have chosen to stand with
my fellow pilots and have attended every event that I could, including going so
far as to self-destruct my transport over New Earth. Since then, I have honored
the strike and continued to join Eli and other fellow pilots in broadcasts and
alike. I am deeply sorry that I was unable to attend the protest.
Now, I was not there during the protest and therefore am unable to give a
firsthand account as to who did what. However, it seems that Lily, being short
on time, made a choice to go put up a beacon out at 777. This choice, triggered
a string of events that Morris calls "natural consequences."
And here is where I would like to share my two credits if I may. First of all,
there is a difference between "natural consequences" and the choice that people
make in reacting to a situation. For example, if one touches a hot stove,
obviously getting hurt is a "natural consequence". However, how people choose to
react around you is their choice and only theirs. For example, the AEU has been
on strike now for over a month. Is it a "natural consequence" that the AEU
government has not really responded to our demands? No, I say that it is their
choice.
*
Despite common belief, when someone is asked to do something, ultimately it is
the person's choice to agree to their request or not. We are all sentient beings
with the ability to make choices. It is the ability to choose that we fought for
against the outsiders and cherish daily. When Eli asked me to stand with him
during broadcasts, it was ultimately my choice to join him or not. Think about
that any time anyone asks you to do something. Whether or not you take the
action that they requested is solely your responsibility. We are all ultimately
responsible for our own individual actions. Saying that someone asked me to do
it and failing to take responsibility for following through with that person's
request does not relieve you of that responsibility.
I understand that Ather was very upset that Lily was unable or in the opinion of
the people, chose not to attend the protest. I'm not saying he was wrong to feel
that way. I understand that it was an important event. However, Lily did offer
an explanation and did express that she wishes she could have been there.
However, not allowing SEAS to participate in stations, not only punishes Lily,
but also punishes all of the rest of the members of SEAS. People who have been
very supportive of the AEU's actions to take a stand against Outccord. While I
understand that many of you were upset that Lily didn't attend the protest, how
you react is still your choice to make and for now, it seems your choice is to
punish all of SEAS, including me. This went from a personal issue and became an
org issue. Seems rather unfair to me.
I have always been as helpful as I can be to all of you and though I have been
angered by some of the actions people have taken in the past, I have always
strived to be understanding towards all of you. We all make mistakes and I'm
sure all of us can do a better job apologizing when we offend people, but as
someone once told me, the only way someone can offend you is if you let them. 
*
*
*
*
Having said all of that, let's just drop this issue and quit beating a dead
horse into the ground. Believe me, there have been times in the past when I
could have created just as much drama over something that someone did to me, but
again, my choice not to and I accept that choice. So, how you all respond is up
to you and only you. Take care all of you and fly safe.

obviously getting hurt is a "natural consequence". However, how people choose to
react around you is their choice and only theirs. For example, the AEU has been
on strike now for over a month. Is it a "natural consequence" that the AEU
government has not really responded to our demands? No, I say that it is their
choice.
Despite common belief, when someone is asked to do something, ultimately it is
the person's choice to agree to their request or not. We are all sentient beings
with the ability to make choices. It is the ability to choose that we fought for
against the outsiders and cherish daily. When Eli asked me to stand with him
during broadcasts, it was ultimately my choice to join him or not. Think about
that any time anyone asks you to do something. Whether or not you take the
action that they requested is solely your responsibility. We are all ultimately
responsible for our own individual actions. Saying that someone asked me to do
it and failing to take responsibility for following through with that person's
request does not relieve you of that responsibility.
I understand that Ather was very upset that Lily was unable or in the opinion of
the people, chose not to attend the protest. I'm not saying he was wrong to feel
that way. I understand that it was an important event. However, Lily did offer
an explanation and did express that she wishes she could have been there.
However, not allowing SEAS to participate in stations, not only punishes Lily,
but also punishes all of the rest of the members of SEAS. People who have been
very supportive of the AEU's actions to take a stand against Outccord. While I
understand that many of you were upset that Lily didn't attend the protest, how
you react is still your choice to make and for now, it seems your choice is to
punish all of SEAS, including me. This went from a personal issue and became an
org issue. Seems rather unfair to me.
I have always been as helpful as I can be to all of you and though I have been
angered by some of the actions people have taken in the past, I have always
strived to be understanding towards all of you. We all make mistakes and I'm
sure all of us can do a better job apologizing when we offend people, but as
someone once told me, the only way someone can offend you is if you let them. 
Having said all of that, let's just drop this issue and quit beating a dead
horse into the ground. Believe me, there have been times in the past when I
could have created just as much drama over something that someone did to me, but
again, my choice not to and I accept that choice. So, how you all respond is up
to you and only you. Take care all of you and fly safe.

Subject: Death and Avarice is calling all pilots. Preliminary post
Author: Johann Schraft
Posted: 15:23 16 September 2317 GST
--
Hello all! allied Libertarians is planning an artifacting trip out to a virgin
field called Death and Avarice. Departure date is still up in the air, but plan
on in the next couple weeks.
Here's what we know so far.
the field is out down Feng Wo way, and is most likely alien artifacts. Nissi is
kindly providing Future Crimes for ship transport, and Lib will be setting up
the beacon, watchtower, and recharger. We will be artifacting close to two
weeks, plus travel time add on a possible week for a total of three weeks gone.
Procedures are as follows.
Those who can, bring your smallest artifacting ship. If you have siteseers or
runabouts those are preferred. On the watchtower, if you encounter qi clan
ships, don't fire at them unless they lock on you or another pilot.
It's possible some people won't have the requirements for a ship out there, so
if you are willing to take someone, please do so.
AEU people, you are welcome to come if you so desire, although we know you are
striking, and if you feel it violates the spirit of the strike, you should by
all means stay back.
If you are interested in going, please either send me a letter, or reply to this
post because I'll probably forget it if you tell me verbally.
If I am forgetting anything, please use common sense, don't ping, and I will
update you as we finalize the departure date and any other things to expect.
thanks,
The Allied Libertarians Team

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm.. Well I
don't nkow Constantine, you are the Voice, but the liaison office hasn't really
been very good about communicating with you anyways at the moment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
sorry, I was distracted for a second, but you're right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Two
weeks is a long time for me to be gone."

Between the windows on each side of this section of corridor are two arches
perhaps twenty feet high, each one containing a small green tree with lacy
leaves. The trees grow from beneath the floor, their slender, dark brown trunks
emerging from decorative circular grates. While most of the illumination here is
provided by the lighted walls, tiny star-like lights twinkle from the boughs of
the trees. Three doorways on the outer side of the corridor lead to small shops,
one selling souvenirs, the second identified by a brightly lit twinkling sign as
'Holiday Ornamentation,' and the third named 'The Ontological Felo,' which has
articles of oddly shaped clothing in a small display window next to the doorway.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Stay put."
[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Beta.
You see a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold

Shuttles:
One-person runabout (gotten from SSN)
Point requirements: none.
Weapons: two turrets
Stock cargo: 10000 units.
Stock charge: 8 hours.
While this ship is findable on SSN, you can if you're so inclined check to see
if other pilots might have tickets that they might be willing to part with,
saving you from needing to watch SSn until tickets redemable for the ship come
up on sale! That is one of the reasons I didn't put a price for this ship down,
though expect to pay a minimum of 170 million EAOS credits for it. More if you
get your ticket from another pilot. Once you have your ticket, just redeem it at
any ship store. This ship is attachable to a tactical platform like other
shuttles. However, the bonuses it gives to the tactical platform are presently
unknown. It also does seem to get a minor max drive velocity bonus.
One-Person Interplanetary Shuttle 5,000,000.00 (Old Earth in the city of
Cherise)
U-1A UNITED FREIGHT D'INTSEC INTERPLANETARY SHUTTLE
Class: Shuttle
Requirements: 100 industry points
Model number: U-1a                      Designation: Interplanetary Shuttle
Turret hardpoints: 0                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 17500        Standard battery hours: 6
Docking bay size required: 23
This ship is mainly useful for intermediate levels of trading. You cannot
salvage with it, but you can attach it to a tactical platform if you're so
inclined. Note: this ship does not have an FTL drive.
One-Person Luxury Sightseer 105,000,000.00 (any hermes branch)
H-07 HERMES COMMUNICATIONS TWO PASSENGER LUXURY SIGHTSEER
Class: Shuttle
Requirements: 2000 industry points      1750 exploration points
Model number: H-07                      Designation: Luxury Sightseer
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 2500         Standard battery hours: 18
Docking bay size required: 5
You might be asking yourselves, "Why didn't Ather leave this in the passenger
ships section?" Wel, this ship is only capable of delivering two passengers, so
it really isn't in a specific tier level because of that, and because of the
number of required points. However, it is equipped with exploration-grade
sensors, which would make it a fairly useful ship for exploration, especially if
one wishes to install an impeller on the thing. Even better, it can be hooked up
to a tactical platform, adding benefits to that particular ship in its own ways.
So, this ship has uses that would probably be geared towards anything other than
delivering passengers. However, if you want to use it to deliver passengers,
well, it can deliver passengers. Enjoy.
One-Person Long-Range Sightseer (approval required) (any Hermes branch)
H-07B HERMES COMMUNICATIONS TWO PASSENGER LUXURY LONG-RANGE SIGHTSEER
Class: Shuttle
Model number: H-07b                     Designation: Long-Range Sightseer
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 2500         Standard battery hours: 20
Docking bay size required: 5
This ship has a living quarters, and can be attached to a tactical platform. It
is a passenger ship like the above-listed ship, so you can use it to deliver
passengers if you really want to. However, with its twenty-hour battery life it
would probably be more suited for the bonuses it has to offer the tactical
platform like the other sightseer.

Sorry, the phone was acting up. Here's the update.
We will be departing on Friday, September 22, at 23:59. Please respond if you
are going at least twelve hours before departure so we can organize who's going
in the carrier and who is going with me in the transport.
Thanks,
Johann Schraft

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.
The current civilian term started on 21 August 2317 GST. Time remaining: 15
days, 3 hours, 31 minutes, and 38 seconds

Lily:
The blame for this doesn't belong with Evenia or Johann or even really with the
person who asked us all to leave your org off stations after that incident
during the protest. That was just the final straw. Many had been kicking around
the idea of making others responsible for your stations for days before that.
And that is completely because you've made it as difficult as possible for
certain other people also involved in station building to work with you. If
you're going to blame something, blame that.
You know I have always trusted you on my expedition crews and so on, that I've
never had any serious issue with you or been much for the bashing of you that
goes on sometimes. So I hope you can trust me when I say that given what needs
to happen with stations on a regular basis, this will just work out better for
everyone. I'm sure things can return to normal once you show you can set aside
differences to work with people professionally, but your posts here aren't the
way to do that. Until then this is the best way to keep stationbuilding going
smoothly. That's it. There's no conspiracy against you.

Johann,
Thanks so much for being so gracious as to allow us to come. You know i'm not
into starting up heated disagreements with a bunch of other pilots around and in
a confined space. In fact, I've called Morris down on his behavior as he and
Aisling kept going at one another on one trip to the point where it just
disrupted everything. Nobody could get a word in with others and it created
horrible negativity. On this last trip, he and Sarah finally had their final
falling out and oh my gods that was too much drama. This was destined to happen
but it's always Morris and something to do with him.
As for Evenia, well it takes two you know. I didn't know what was even going on
for two days until I went to check mail and as I was posting a letter, I suppose
ather handed me a letter then I noticed it a little later as I wasn't looking
up. I wrote yu both asking what was going on with the salvage Station, no
response and then I was told by Constantine how she had removed modules from our
warehouse without even a word. I can forgive and forget when people treat me and
those who work with me fairly. People had told me that evenia can be your friend
to the extent that it serves her. I honestly didn't believe them because there
are so many really evil pilots out there and I felt they were merely spreading
dirt and because they get away with it. I'd like to still hold Evenia in a
higher regard than others do but what she did came across as betrayal when I
thought out of all other pilots, that LIBS would stick with us and not give into
Ather who, as you know is extremely bittered. I sympathize with ather's
situation as what he did was not at all deserving of being rogued nor Eli.
Still, i will do my utmost to get along with evenia on this trip but it will
take me awhile to sort this out as I was deeply hurt by her actions.
As for your approach towards me when I might have been late with putting up a
station, I will accept your word. I just felt put off because I already felt
badly that I hadn't been able to put a station back together. Now that I have
Constantine on board with building, he is a tremendous help and I know he was
pleased to continue to help out with 777. Shule does also but he's just not much
into building. He will go deploy stations but I have to do the assembly work
ahead of time.
I'm sorry Johann for what I've said. I considered you to be a friend before but
I felt that you turned your back on me for Ather's hate on Lily action. He found
a means to exploit something and he got away with it for all of the wrong
reasons.
As for the starship we'd like to bring, It may just be Shule and myself because
Constantine is concerned about being away from his post too long. I respect his
decision but he already has expressed a keen interest in Exploration and i so
wanted him to be a part of this. I wanted our members to be able to launch and
go artifacting if I wasn't available. But as long as i'm in the Sightseer,
anyone can launch as it's a Long-Range. We have other smaller ships but they
don't have Hyperwave and we can't go across the Skim to get upgrades so we
couldn't get them upgraded. I haven't seen Tara around a lot over the past
couple of days. I posted a Comm notice for everyone to be aware of and so
hopefully, it will be that we can bring her along with us. So my answer is yes,
a Sightseer and if Tara joins us, if there is room for her Scout or a Runabout
for her, then fine. Otherwise, Shule and I will take her artifacting in the
Sightseer as we don't want to prevent others from going who want to go as well.
As for maintaining 777, please reconsiderworking with us again. I know Nissi
mentioned problems with stations but the only station I was involved with out in
the other areas was the Asteroid station in 285 and it's been all Morris.
Melinda wrote me a letter and explicitly told me that he wasn't to be added to
the Asteroid processor so here I get caught in the middle because Morris is
pressuring me and so my response to him was that if Joel didn't provide a module
or we could figure out a Module that he could obtain, then I would certainly
accomodate him but as per usual, this wasn't enough for Morris so I'm sure he
put up a big fuss with Nissi and got his way. I really didn't care one way or
the other but when he was pressuring me, I had to tell him what i was asked to
do and I still accomodated him. So this is no reason for us to be taken off of
stations. If I had room for Morris, I'd accomodate him even though I am truly
not over-fond of him. I consider this to be a business arrangement and liking
someone isn't what always makes business evolve.
Johann, we'll be ready on the 22nd. If there's anything we can do, please don't
hesitate to call on any of SEAS to help.

Lily. I don't have a problem with Seas coming along at all. I can't speak for
everyone, but I hope that everyone going can at least be curteous while confined
in a small area. Hopefully us all being in the same place will help everyone
settle things down, although I do know that Evenia is still quite upset by some
of your accusations, and an effort to positively communicate would go a long way
towards mitigating that.
I appreciate your offer to provide stations, but we are actually already stocked
up on stuff and the stuff we need is the stuff I need to get from cats. Since
the only station that's providing money is the repair station, and probably only
a few hundred thousand credits at most, no org will be missing out on much if
any.
As a side note, I am sorry you took my tone about stations going down as me
being upset. Generally when I ask about stations it's generally just me making
sure people are aware it's down or almost down, and if they're not able to put
it up what I need to do to help out. The only times I can picture being abrupt
is if there's a pilot trapped somewhere, but that's more I want them to get home
safely as soon as they can.
Also, clarification, if the four of you are going, you're bringing the scout? Or
are you bringing the siteseer regardless?
thanks,
Johann Schraft

Johann,
Thanks so much for being so gracious as to allow us to come. You know i'm not
into starting up heated disagreements with a bunch of other pilots around and in
a confined space. In fact, I've called Morris down on his behavior as he and
Aisling kept going at one another on one trip to the point where it just
disrupted everything. Nobody could get a word in with others and it created
horrible negativity. On this last trip, he and Sarah finally had their final
falling out and oh my gods that was too much drama. This was destined to happen
but it's always Morris and something to do with him.
As for Evenia, well it takes two you know. I didn't know what was even going on
for two days until I went to check mail and as I was posting a letter, I suppose
ather handed me a letter then I noticed it a little later as I wasn't looking
up. I wrote yu both asking what was going on with the salvage Station, no
response and then I was told by Constantine how she had removed modules from our
warehouse without even a word. I can forgive and forget when people treat me and
those who work with me fairly. People had told me that evenia can be your friend
to the extent that it serves her. I honestly didn't believe them because there
are so many really evil pilots out there and I felt they were merely spreading
dirt and because they get away with it. I'd like to still hold Evenia in a
higher regard than others do but what she did came across as betrayal when I
thought out of all other pilots, that LIBS would stick with us and not give into
Ather who, as you know is extremely bittered. I sympathize with ather's
situation as what he did was not at all deserving of being rogued nor Eli.
Still, i will do my utmost to get along with evenia on this trip but it will
take me awhile to sort this out as I was deeply hurt by her actions.
As for your approach towards me when I might have been late with putting up a
station, I will accept your word. I just felt put off because I already felt
badly that I hadn't been able to put a station back together. Now that I have
Constantine on board with building, he is a tremendous help and I know he was
pleased to continue to help out with 777. Shule does also but he's just not much
into building. He will go deploy stations but I have to do the assembly work
ahead of time.
I'm sorry Johann for what I've said. I considered you to be a friend before but
I felt that you turned your back on me for Ather's hate on Lily action. He found
a means to exploit something and he got away with it for all of the wrong
reasons.
As for the starship we'd like to bring, It may just be Shule and myself because
Constantine is concerned about being away from his post too long. I respect his
decision but he already has expressed a keen interest in Exploration and i so
wanted him to be a part of this. I wanted our members to be able to launch and
go artifacting if I wasn't available. But as long as i'm in the Sightseer,
anyone can launch as it's a Long-Range. We have other smaller ships but they
don't have Hyperwave and we can't go across the Skim to get upgrades so we
couldn't get them upgraded. I haven't seen Tara around a lot over the past
couple of days. I posted a Comm notice for everyone to be aware of and so
hopefully, it will be that we can bring her along with us. So my answer is yes,
a Sightseer and if Tara joins us, if there is room for her Scout or a Runabout
for her, then fine. Otherwise, Shule and I will take her artifacting in the
Sightseer as we don't want to prevent others from going who want to go as well.
As for maintaining 777, please reconsiderworking with us again. I know Nissi
mentioned problems with stations but the only station I was involved with out in
the other areas was the Asteroid station in 285 and it's been all Morris.
Melinda wrote me a letter and explicitly told me that he wasn't to be added to
the Asteroid processor so here I get caught in the middle because Morris is
pressuring me and so my response to him was that if Joel didn't provide a module
or we could figure out a Module that he could obtain, then I would certainly
accomodate him but as per usual, this wasn't enough for Morris so I'm sure he
put up a big fuss with Nissi and got his way. I really didn't care one way or
the other but when he was pressuring me, I had to tell him what i was asked to
do and I still accomodated him. So this is no reason for us to be taken off of
stations. If I had room for Morris, I'd accomodate him even though I am truly
not over-fond of him. I consider this to be a business arrangement and liking
someone isn't what always makes business evolve.
Johann, we'll be ready on the 22nd. If there's anything we can do, please don't
hesitate to call on any of SEAS to help.

Subject: eath and Avarice is calling all pilots
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 22:56 16 September 2317 GST
--
Death and Avarice is calling all pilots is an Artifacting trip to a field of
shipwrecks very far out there near Feng Wo Station in the Feng Wo Trading
Collective. We may even get our hands on those rare remote Artifacts. I only
have perhaps one of those rare Remote Artifacts out of the hundreds of artifacts
that I have collected. So this is so exciting and it is an uncommon opportunity
albeit since artifacts out over 30 Light-Trade Cycles don't even yield much for
those of us with higher Exploration experience anymore.
Let's coordinate so that any of you who want to go are with Shule and me prior
to leaving and so on.
Here are the Departure Details from Johann:
We will be departing on Friday, September 22, at 23:59. Please respond if you
are going at least twelve hours before departure so we can organize who's going
in the carrier and who is going with me in the transport.
The Carrier can accomodate 120 Units of docked starships. If a lot of scouts are
docked, it means fewer people can go so take this into consideration. I am
taking a Sightseer which only requires 5 Units of Docking Bay space whereas a
Scout requires 12.5 Units. Our AEU Scouts are a bit smaller than League because
of the League's larger Cargo Hold. Constantine or Tara, if you both want to go
and bring your own ships, remember that Hyperwave communications is essential
out there particularly with situations whereby the Sector where the stations are
becomes hot with Pirates, Ifs and let's hope no Outsiders. You certainly don't
want to be on your way in if the Sector is hot and end up in an escape Pod. A
Runabout requires 6.5 Docking Bay Units so that's not a bad choice provided you
have a Autovector Drive as you won't needa Rift Drive either. Shule and I are
fine to accomodate you both in the Sightseer. It will be a bit cozy in there
with 4 of us but we will make it work! It's just that I have to be on board to
launch it which I certainly can be most of the time. So it just depends on your
own preference. If Johann can accomodate you, then bring whatever ship you
prefer but nothing larger than an exploration Scout and you need to clear this
with Johann Schraft prior to arrival to dock your starship.
This trip's duration is about three weeks of time as it will require a few days
to travel out to this Field. I would think we will likely go to Andy's and
perhaps onto tom Town and although it wasn't mentioned, perhaps to Feng Wo
Station.
If you can join us, this is truly going to be one of those memorable trips and
it will definitely be worth your time to participate.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.

Johann, I will apologize to evenia but she isn't being as forthcoming as you'd
like. I know for a fact, that she made advances toward Shule and it made Shule
extremely uncomfortable as we are and have been an intact couple for over a year
and a half now. We'd be married now if the aEU Government would allow AEU pilots
to marry. It's like this Johann, we all meet others throughout our lives and
careers who we are attracted to. It's how you approach thos attractions or how
you choose to remain silent for personal or for professional reasons. You don't
express such to another person who is in an intact relationship as it's an
obvious ploy to cause interference. I knew this and thankfully, so far as i
know, Shule has been faithful and I was willing to let this go since he is the
one who sleeps with me. So based upon some other information i have which has
certainly been expressed by other pilots, again, I was not in agreement with
them as I thought perhaps Evenia was mis-understood, and yes, even knowing what
I know relative to my own personal relationship with someone. So I didn't refer
to her behavior specifically as being promiscuous but it certainly isn't
appropriate behavior. Then when she didn't even inform me of her intentions and
took the modules out of our warehouse, this sounded lots of alarms. It also
created an atmosphere of a serious breech of trust. As for Morris, I didn't
realize what he had done until Constantine informed me of Evenia's actions and
so I took a look at the log and of course Morris was having a party out there
obviously! I unfortunately will probably never trust Evenia to the extent that I
did so she must agree to at least one condition before I apologize to her. That
condition is that ifever she is to remove more than certain Modules from SEAS
Warehouse, that we discuss it first. Yes those Modules belonged to LIBS.
However, in turn, she tied our hands to the point whereby we have already lost
the Transmitter in 777 which I was going to put together that day as I certainly
wanted LIBS to be included in spite of not making a single credit on anything
but the Toll Station Still, I am willing to apologize to her but she must agree
to be more forthcoming about things in the future. I would not allow anyone from
SEAS nor do that to LIBS without your having some knowledge about what was to
take place and the reasons why. I really don't think this is too much to ask as
it's merely asking for common courtessy towards the party to whom you may no
longer to do business with. They should at least have an understanding as to the
circumstances of the breech of contract or other business arrangements. If a
Trustee of mine did this, I would demote them. I don't dictate to my members but
I hold them to a high ethical standard and so far, I believe in all of them. If
I could divide up SEAS into shares, each would have equal ownership because I
look to them as having their own Organization which I was able to provide
startup costs and other aspects for but it's theirs as much as it is mine. So
this is another reason why I take this personally as although others wanted to
inflict harm upon me, they didn't stop to consider that there are three others
besides me. Therefore, if they have an issue with me, then they should address
it with me and not SEAS. I am personally disappointed that I couldn't
participate in the protest as I would have but personal circumstances kept me
away for which I don't believe I owe an apology for except that I regret that I
couldn't be available. This sort of harsh treatment was not warranted as I have
done far more than the majority of AEU pilots to oppose Outccort and I won't
stop for as long as I am able to. Our Liaison office is so not responding to us
too which gives me the impression that we have made progress. I'll probably put
up some more signs before I escape out of Comms too and if they catch me, then
good luck to them! So yes, Evenia isn't perfect, nor are all of us but she needs
to communicate her intentions especially when they are as drastic as what
occurred the other day. If I receive your acknowledgement of this, I will
restore yours and Evenia's access to SEAS Warehouse. I never revoked Nicolette's
because, ironically, she has been one of the few pilots who have been reasonable
and fair when we worked together on the Asteroid station in 288 and otherwise.
we've also had our differences. However, I've seen a lot of very positive growth
in Nicolette and so you see, I am always willing to forgive others when they
make an honest and concerted effort to correct their behavior. I am sorry that
Nicolette's own organization didn't go forward. However, I find some humor in
what she was doing and perhaps this is what her intention was all along! As
oftentimes, I would love to express something very similar and especially to the
Morris's in the Universe! Take Care, Lily

Lily. I don't have a problem with Seas coming along at all. I can't speak for
everyone, but I hope that everyone going can at least be curteous while confined
in a small area. Hopefully us all being in the same place will help everyone
settle things down, although I do know that Evenia is still quite upset by some
of your accusations, and an effort to positively communicate would go a long way
towards mitigating that.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow

still working. So I'm not technically on strike."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You
definitely have a point, Ather. I was hoping having billions of credits they
knew they couldn't get at until the strike ended might entice them to play
ball."

that only really makes sense if we're all committed to never working again if we
don't get what we want."

like being on strike any more than the next pilot. I feel like I have to do

no reason to do it in this dingy office."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well,
I know that I am. The rest of you, I know that you're trying to shoot high, and
you're pretty fresh out of pilot training. I understand that your priorities are
different. The administration is probably counting on that though, and waiting
for you guys to just say fuck it and start working. Which we can't stop you from
doing, but I'm doing what I can by cautioning you."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Ather is correct up to a point Constantine but you should do what you want to.
We never have to turn in those artifacts at all either! We could also turn them
in on other alliance ports and aEU really wouldn't benefit."

--
Johann, I will apologize to evenia but she isn't being as forthcoming as you'd
like. I know for a fact, that she made advances toward Shule and it made Shule
extremely uncomfortable as we are and have been an intact couple for over a year
and a half now. We'd be married now if the aEU Government would allow AEU pilots
to marry. It's like this Johann, we all meet others throughout our lives and
careers who we are attracted to. It's how you approach thos attractions or how
you choose to remain silent for personal or for professional reasons. You don't
express such to another person who is in an intact relationship as it's an
obvious ploy to cause interference. I knew this and thankfully, so far as i
know, Shule has been faithful and I was willing to let this go since he is the
one who sleeps with me. So based upon some other information i have which has
certainly been expressed by other pilots, again, I was not in agreement with
them as I thought perhaps Evenia was mis-understood, and yes, even knowing what
I know relative to my own personal relationship with someone. So I didn't refer
to her behavior specifically as being promiscuous but it certainly isn't
appropriate behavior. Then when she didn't even inform me of her intentions and
took the modules out of our warehouse, this sounded lots of alarms. It also
created an atmosphere of a serious breech of trust. As for Morris, I didn't
realize what he had done until Constantine informed me of Evenia's actions and
so I took a look at the log and of course Morris was having a party out there
obviously! I unfortunately will probably never trust Evenia to the extent that I
did so she must agree to at least one condition before I apologize to her. That
condition is that ifever she is to remove more than certain Modules from SEAS
Warehouse, that we discuss it first. Yes those Modules belonged to LIBS.
However, in turn, she tied our hands to the point whereby we have already lost
the Transmitter in 777 which I was going to put together that day as I certainly
wanted LIBS to be included in spite of not making a single credit on anything
but the Toll Station Still, I am willing to apologize to her but she must agree
to be more forthcoming about things in the future. I would not allow anyone from
SEAS nor do that to LIBS without your having some knowledge about what was to
take place and the reasons why. I really don't think this is too much to ask as
it's merely asking for common courtessy towards the party to whom you may no
longer to do business with. They should at least have an understanding as to the
circumstances of the breech of contract or other business arrangements. If a
Trustee of mine did this, I would demote them. I don't dictate to my members but
I hold them to a high ethical standard and so far, I believe in all of them. If
I could divide up SEAS into shares, each would have equal ownership because I
look to them as having their own Organization which I was able to provide
startup costs and other aspects for but it's theirs as much as it is mine. So
this is another reason why I take this personally as although others wanted to
inflict harm upon me, they didn't stop to consider that there are three others
besides me. Therefore, if they have an issue with me, then they should address
it with me and not SEAS. I am personally disappointed that I couldn't
participate in the protest as I would have but personal circumstances kept me
away for which I don't believe I owe an apology for except that I regret that I
couldn't be available. This sort of harsh treatment was not warranted as I have
done far more than the majority of AEU pilots to oppose Outccort and I won't
stop for as long as I am able to. Our Liaison office is so not responding to us
too which gives me the impression that we have made progress. I'll probably put
up some more signs before I escape out of Comms too and if they catch me, then
good luck to them! So yes, Evenia isn't perfect, nor are all of us but she needs
to communicate her intentions especially when they are as drastic as what
occurred the other day. If I receive your acknowledgement of this, I will
restore yours and Evenia's access to SEAS Warehouse. I never revoked Nicolette's
because, ironically, she has been one of the few pilots who have been reasonable
and fair when we worked together on the Asteroid station in 288 and otherwise.
we've also had our differences. However, I've seen a lot of very positive growth
in Nicolette and so you see, I am always willing to forgive others when they
make an honest and concerted effort to correct their behavior. I am sorry that
Nicolette's own organization didn't go forward. However, I find some humor in
what she was doing and perhaps this is what her intention was all along! As
oftentimes, I would love to express something very similar and especially to the
Morris's in the Universe! Take Care, Lily

Subject: Letter to Nissi Valdaire in Defense of SEAS
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 23:00 17 September 2317 GST
--
Hi nissi,
Up until 'know-it-all' Morris formed his own organization, I did fairly well
with station building. I was only maintaining the Asteroid Station in 285 but
Morris kept clamoring for it which I mentioned to Melinda as I really was ready
to let him take it over. Melinda kept saying that he shouldn't always get his
way and not to cave- into him. However, Morris has been excessively jealous of
SEAS since its inception and done everything possible to prevent our growth. So
when Morris left starseekers and when he established his organization, Melinda
wrote to me as follows:
hi,
Morris is not yet in a position to earn anything from stations. However, as I
have done for every org, including Seas, when he is able to begin earning
megacredits, he gets preferencial treatment. He is planning to vassalize so
we'll want him to get megacredits quickly. Joel even got this done for him when
he was starting out.
Melinda
Therefore, when I was ready to build the next Asteroid Processor in 285, Morris
started pressuring me to include him. I wrote him and informed him that Melinda
had specifically specified that he not be included just yet. However, if I had a
slot, that I would be more than happy to accomodate him which I did from day
one. I know he likely pitched a fit with you Nissi. Still, please understand
that I was following Melinda's directive and had to be straight with him. I did
accomodate him and never left him nor anyone off of the processor who I could
obtain Modules from. Joel has been very difficult to deal with because he
wouldn't provide modules so I had to hunt for them. So recently, he finally
loaded a couple of Cores into SEAS Warehouse and then ather had his Tantrum. So
I know that you want to hear everyone but I honestly believe that SEAS nor I
have been given a fair deal here. Morris, as you know makes a lot of clamor
about everything. I realize that you should listen to your own Alliance pilots
first. Other than this, I certainly would appreciate knowing what the other
issues were as I have worked diligently to maintain the Asteroid Processor in
285 and to be certain that there was little downtime. I've had my Trustees
available to deploy the Asteroid Processor whenever I couldn't.
I have worked very hard, per the available time that I am at work on the effort
to obstruct and to campaign against Outccord, far more than the majority of AEU
pilots. So it's unfortunate that the time which Eli planned the protest effort,
I simply could not come to work. When I had already started out to put up the
Beacon, I had no knowledge, whatsoever, that the protest was ongoing as Eli
didn't post anything to other aEU pilots. I frequently mute the General channel
too so if he announced it there, then he left out the rest of us but still, i
wasn't at work so I wouldn't have heard anything and known. Had I done nothing
up to that point to work towards Outccord, I would consider what Ather claimed
to be justified but it's clear he did this for spite without any consideration
for what I have already accomplished towards this end.
Thank you Nissi
Kind regards,
Lily Kaise

Given the latest news headline I am going to have to decline this artifacting
trip for the time being. This is the second headline about violence in a few
days. While I am fully aware that these issues will have to primarily be dealt
with by the AEU, something may come up that would require others assistance. I
apologize for any inconvenience this causes anyone but feel it's the right
decision for me at this time. For those who go, enjoy and have a prosperous
trip. I just feel that the waters are growing more turbulent here at home and
cannot, in good conscience, make the trip.

[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily will
probably more than likely end up complaining more about the artifacting trip
getting canceled, instead if you all are going to do all that."

Subject: Death and Avarice postponed
Author: Johann Schraft

Due to the AEU situation, lots of people are dropping out just in case.
rather than going with a limited crew, the trip will be postponed until the
situation is stable.
Everyone who has spots on the trip will have them reserved, should you wish to
go at that time.
thanks,
Johann Schraft

Thank you Johann.
I'm glad you chose to do this.
I would have had to stay behind even if you'd decided to continue the trip.
This is just the wrong time to go away.
But we'll go eventually, and the artifacts will still be there.
To the AEU people, keep the faith, an" we're all behind you one hundred percent.

Thank you Johann, contrary to the nay-sayers out there, I had already posted a
Comm message to SEAS requesting that they stand by as we would drop out based
upon the need to serve our AEU citizens. Sorry to disappoint your assumptions
Melinda as well but I do certainly consider our responsibilities over an
artifacting trip. Thank you Johann for holding our spots on the crew list and we
will see how circumstances are at the time when the rescheduled trip occurs.

Hellow SEAS, based upon the most recent News reports as of 9-18-2317, we will be
observing developments over the next few days. Contrary to the nay-sayers of
Melinda Michaels and others, I certainly will not go forward to participate in
the upcoming Artifacting trip particularly we may need to be available to defend
our fellow citizens. So please be vigilent and of course there will be other
Exploration and Artifacting trips in the future.
To add to this, Johann has postponed the trip and this comes as a great relief
as I wouldn't want for you all to have prepared to go and then have to change
plans at the last minute. As you can see, there are some really childish pilots
out there and I don't think I need to name other names! There will certainly be
more trips in the future and i'm not as uncaring about our citizens as some
would like to fabricate based soley upon Ather's recent tantrum.
So stay tuned to your News Reader, the Message Boards and any other resources.
Above all, be ready to defend our aEU citizens and all other humanity.

Johann,
Thank you for taking so much care to postpone the Artifacting trip. Just after I
read the headlines, I was already drafting a comm notice to SEAS as there is
absolutely no way that we would have joined the trip given what may evolve.
It's amazing though as I know that I'm no less disappointed that the trip won't
happen at this time than others Still, it won't likely to be the last trip of
this nature and as I expressed to SEAS, being here for AEU citizens is of more
importance. I'm sure that the drama queens just wanted something to cure their
own childish boredom and to lashout at some target for their own disappointment.
It's sad for them indeed but I certainly know what we must do.
Kind regards,

communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Anyway, I'm glad Johann postponed the trip. I actually was hoping it wouldn't
be this soon but given the circumstances, I'm not happy that this is what
postponed the trip because this is just horrible and we do have to be here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd like to know
what's going through best's head. Why organize a Taskforce? What does he hope to
accomplish here?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
think I wasn't going to go anyway, but at least maybe I'll have to opportunity
to go later."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh
nothing I'm sure but a lot more needs to take place which should have occurred
months ago."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
he means to institute martial law on every planet but New Earth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's
how I'm reading it. That might not be his express intention, but that's going to
the result, starting with Hyperion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob snorts in disbelief. Yeah, that's
totally gonna work. Sure.

insane, and no probably not all the worlds, I would bet just the Cheyenne's Star
ones."

Riverway colonies too? I can't remember where Aenea is."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

scarey stuff and it has more implications i'm sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Aenea is
in the Cheyanne cluster."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, why
a task force for troubled world's? Why not just send support or extra personnel
to Hyperion's law enforcement? This is some crazy stuff to wake up to, I'm glad
I waited a bit before reading it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's all insanity,
Eli."
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yeah, that's how I interpret it."

sorry about that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. in
thought."

wouldn't be very good company anways, I'm still a bit stunned."

I'll get over it."

excitement soon enough."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This is
true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Apparently pilots are meant to be the peacekeeping task force."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Wait.. what?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Way to
not read the room, Best. I don't know if any of us would risk our lives to
protect NaPas."

bit of chatter over general earlier about it."

everyone know if I do."

over general and not through the terminal? Who said that?"

asked if I would be patrolling."

we would be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I
responded."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And
Morris said he wondered if they would be paying us for that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wouldn't
take much stock in that. A Leager and a Mutuality pilot aren't going to know
anything about this."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
you might be right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Wouldn't make
much sense. Not sure what pilots are supposed to do about someone behing
beheaded in their homes. It's not like she lived in a starship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, if they
do though, they're in for what shouldn't be a surprise. I can't imagine any of
us being on board with turning into world police."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Seems like it
to me."

two cadets."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ryo retired?
Whaa?"

he retired a couple weeks back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that
happens a good bit, actually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You will
sometimes get a bunch of acadets and they just go off and we never hear from 'em
again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
figure the attrition rate must be pretty high around here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Especially with what's been going on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's always
been like that though, for some reaso."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. reason."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
suppose it's sort of a different lifestyle."

Lily. I don't have a problem with Seas coming along at all. I can't speak for
everyone, but I hope that everyone going can at least be curteous while confined
in a small area. Hopefully us all being in the same place will help everyone
settle things down, although I do know that Evenia is still quite upset by some
of your accusations, and an effort to positively communicate would go a long way
towards mitigating that.
I appreciate your offer to provide stations, but we are actually already stocked
up on stuff and the stuff we need is the stuff I need to get from cats. Since
the only station that's providing money is the repair station, and probably only
a few hundred thousand credits at most, no org will be missing out on much if
any.
As a side note, I am sorry you took my tone about stations going down as me
being upset. Generally when I ask about stations it's generally just me making
sure people are aware it's down or almost down, and if they're not able to put
it up what I need to do to help out. The only times I can picture being abrupt
is if there's a pilot trapped somewhere, but that's more I want them to get home
safely as soon as they can.
Also, clarification, if the four of you are going, you're bringing the scout? Or
are you bringing the siteseer regardless?
thanks,
Johann Schraft

using hte execution of one of his own party to further his own agenda,
disgusting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "My best

streets."

the streets though? I mean we're pilots, what the hell?"

how it would be portrayed so I'm not gonna do it, but I'm tempted to just say
yes and see what they want us to do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
was tempted to do the same. I guarantee if I had a headline would have quickly
followed though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, for
sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Instead of it
saying "Area pilot asks question" it would say "Brave Loyalist constantine Stone

about that? They already think im some loyalist as it is, joining up might make
your whole campaign harder."

prefer it if we froze him out entirely, but I can't stop you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, it might
make you look pretty bad if you do, but yeah we can't stop you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Personally,
I'd wait a little bit.. I'm gonna look into a couple of things, there might be
others who are asking for your help elsewhere."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
the first thing I tried to see is if there was a guy on each planet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you do
that though, We'll all do our best to make folks understand if they get all
judgey heh. I would recommend not doing it though."

didn't find any anywhere else."

headline, I knew that was coming."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But make
no mistake, this isn't going to assist anyone."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "I really hope
Ihaven't screwed something up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So what
did he say?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn'
tthink he'd be like " Ok yeah, you'r ein." I certainly thought he'd give me a
cahnce to back out or something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well honestly
guys.. I'ts worse than we thought."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hold up, let

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When I said I

sensors right away."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
geez."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Patrolling our streets in suits?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's.. that's going
to make people scared. Very scared."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, this is
sick. And battlesuits can actually kill someone. We're not talking stun weapons
here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "He
doesn't expect you to use suit weapons on civilians?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It doesn't matter,
Con. Its the fact the suits are seen."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I
mean I think he must expect that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You
know, he might have just handed us something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe
you should do a broadcast about this."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Perhaps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I got an idea!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What are
you thinking?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Probably not a good
one, but an idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If you
want to do a broadcast, Eli, maybe you can include footage of a tier 5 fringe
suit or something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And be
like look what he wants to have walking down our streets."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
people definitely need to know about this. I doubt even the NaPas agree with
this 100%."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did I miss
Tara's idea?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't
think so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "A jolly
parade of syrup suits?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, now
when I talk to him he asks me if I'm ready for a mission.. good lord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What if we turned this
patrol thing around and used AEU suit's repair abilities to -help- civilians. I
mean, best might take advantage of it, but theres a lot of places that still
need repairs! Like I said, probably not a good idea, but still an idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Wha?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ha! Not sure
that would work, but I like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
it's an interesting idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not
sure the microdrones are good for fixing anything but suits, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "They aren't, I don't think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "To catch
you up Evangeline, Best wants us running patrols on Union planets in our
battlesuits."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Seriously? Why?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That would be
awesome though. Yeah sure I'll go oppress these citizens, and then just start
fixing up their houses."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "That's rediculous..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think

Eva. Things are getting hot."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Anything but other suits."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "At the very least a
battle suit can carry a lot of supplies or work tools that civilain workers
couldnt."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I agree Eva,
but it's still a cool idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It would be
funny if it worked."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know
I talked to him about it so that no one else would have to. He signed me up but
I'm not going to actually accept a mission."

"Yeah, I'm rather hesitant to go one one of these peacekeeping patrols."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Tried to tell
him to hold his horses, but he just signed me right up after I said I was
interested in what he had to say."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I'm glad I didn't talk to him, then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I probably would have had some choice words, if I could even get
them out of my mouth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Fortunate that I doubt anyone is going to do this. We've had what, two people
killed in as many weeks? If the separatists see battlesuits walking around..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
they're going to move on from amateur status and take things up a notch."

going to talk to him at all, but I didn't want curiosity getting the better of
folks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I read about that hyperion woman who was beheaded in her home."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Best coul
dhave easily prevented that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. Best
could have easily prevented that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Yes, I know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He could have
entered into talks with the sepratists, instead of charging the senators who
suggested it with terrorism."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "So what do you want to do?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I'm sitting in my transport itching to salvage or something to be
honest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I forgot
how to salvage."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Oh, no I didn't say you were aruging."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Angles?
What are those."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok..
hehe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "We've been doing no work at all and our muscle memory is shot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What is this
salvaging you speak of."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We only
try to salvage the Union."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But our
angle seems quite wrong."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Yup, it does."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Basically my idea was
to turn best's intentions on its head. This is clearly a tactic to create fear
and distrust in pilots, I believe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Yeah, but how are we going to turn his intentions on their head if
he's already halfway standing on it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "And did you talk to Best in person, Eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Huh? No no."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's a
naval officer in the security center."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Oh lord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Do you think I should talk to him?"
tr org I have an idea.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"I have an idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
the fewer of us who get our suits fitted with whatever kind of civilian-tracking
sensors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
better."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably not.
He gives you a yes or no question, if you say yes he signs you up. But it looks
like you have to actually accept a mission after that so as long as you don't do
that yo'ure fine."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What's
that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "... Yeah but if we have sensors tracking us..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "At least I
would think, but honestly I wouldn't even sign up in the first place. I'm quite
irritated that I got signed up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I just wanted
to hear him out."
tra org I'm considering signing up for a patrol, just to see what it's like, but
purposefully get my battlesuit blown up. It'd hurt the conquest goals too.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Well... it's best not to feed into it then."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"I'm considering signing up for a patrol, just to see what it's like, but
purposefully get my battlesuit blown up. It'd hurt the conquest goals too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Well, he apparently doesn't care one way or the other."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm.. I
don't know. I really think even a whiff of these machines on our streets is
going to stir up more trouble."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Just read the com notice, Not gonna do it."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Besides, we're striking. If he wants us working there are things he needs to do
first."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I mean not gonna go up to that guy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I hear
ya."
tr org I know he wants us to work, but blowing up a battlesuit hurts conquest
goals a lot!
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"I know he wants us to work, but blowing up a battlesuit hurts conquest goals a
lot!"
tra org Especially a tier 5
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Especially a tier 5."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm very
curious what these missions could be though. It apparently involves some kind of
scanner. This makes it sounds like things are already going down that we jus
tdon't know about."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
that's true. But accepting the job is agreeing to work, and accepting the job
will mean battlesuits on the street."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I wondered about that
too, Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "... You are curious about the mission yet you don't want to do it?
I'm confused."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which
will scare people, and I think escalate this situation."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Are you signed up too Tara?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "No, I haven't signed
up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What I mean
is. If they're deploying battlesuits, and they're all set for it, then what are
they deploying against?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No I get
that. I'd love to know exactly what they want us doing, but I think putting
battlesuits on the street is a bad idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "It's rather hard to move around in the armor."
tr org I want to see what the mission is like. Just curious, but doing it in a
way that will hurt conquest goals and our productivity. It won't help him at all
if I get a tier 5 suti blown up. Our productivity will be worse than if I don't
do anything.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"I want to see what the mission is like. Just curious, but doing it in a way

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I
can't stop you."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Be
careful."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Shule, if you can,
figure out what the guy means by scanning. Eli said his battlesuit got upgraded
with a special sensor system."
\tr org ?Yeah, the security guy told me the same thing. That mine got upgraded
with a scanner.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"?Yeah, the security guy told me the same thing. That mine got upgraded with a

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wish I had
known someone was goign to do that. That's why I talked ot the guy so no one
else would have to."

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings AEU, Regarding the new Ground
combat work available to us, although new work under different circumstances is
always challenging and fun! However, I highly discourage anyone to participate
in this work for the time-being. While I am in favor of helping to maintain
peace amongst citizens and to do whatever it takes to aid and to protect
humanity, I am very much not in favor of anyone's participation in work which
yields income to ourselves and to the Government towards this Peace-Keeping
initiative. If the Government has other options for us to do peace-keeping work
which involves no reward, then this will be acceptable. If you do engage, I will
not be over-concerned though with reports of destroyed battlesuits. I have a big
rubber stamp which will get some much-needed action! Hopefully it won't run dry
on ink! [20:35 18 September 2317 GST]

the fact that you'll have a battlesuit there, with or without weapons is going
to be pretty damning, and keep the citizens firmly against us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed.
Knowing what the missions entails doesn't really help us, but putting suits in
the streets is going to escalate this problem."

A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels
itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Personally I think
best is insain for asking us to do this. While I do not at all mind helping to
maintain peace, I don't want to do it for a guy like him. I'd rather do it for
myself and the rest of the alliance. That's just me though. And as for it being
rewarded, one should not have to accept rewards to feel that they can help to
maintain peace. It should be done of one's own free will."

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey
Constantine, I've been considering these missions and when I can, I am probably
going to see if I can convince shule that we probably shouldn't go for them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
it's probably for the best. I just think undertaking them even as an experiment
might do more harm than good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oops,
miscom, but yeah."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah
I agree. I don't mind a few broken bones but what worries me if those violent
types out may be using all kinds of evil stuff. I doubt it's anything like what
we're acustomed to under typical ground combat conditions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And if
it is indeed combat, I'd be worried about the targets, as well. Surely they
don't have suits."

is true."

if I could patrol the streets with my arachnoid along with me and if I find
someone who is getting out of hand and can stun them a little and get them to a
Security office, that's one thing but having to do this in battlesuits is...
yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed.
Bringing our giant walking weapons platforms into it is going to escalate
things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Civilian pilots have no part, and should have no part in maintaining the peace
on any of the AEU worlds. That's not our job. It is, additionally, not our job
to silence the people. If there is someone committing a crime, it should be
handled via the natural progression of alliance laws, not under marshall law and
a virtual tribunal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's
only going to cast us in a worse light if we start helping the current
administration enforce their new tyrannical policies."

call off Shule if you can, because he's not responding to alliance comms."

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", the four-person light
carrier "You Have Clearance To Launch", and the two-person Accord gemini "Cherry
Cola Float" are landed here.

they're still giving resources to the alliance."
Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "Yep."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "All that's happening is your points aren't
being credited. The alliance is still getting the resources though."

after."

"I thought that'd be obvious!" Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa glances wildly about
in a paranoid manner.

Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The point is to keep stuff away from the alliance."
Morris Corlew says, "It may not break the literal rules of the strike, but it
certainly breaks the spirit."
Ather says to Eli, "Anywya, a strike implies you're not going to do any work. If
you still do work though, in the form of gathering up artifacts to turn in
later, that's not going on strike."
Johann Schraft says, "At least you still have possession of the artifacts until
the strike is over."
Johann says to Eli, "You could give me artifacts, I need the money."
Sarah Bellamy asks, "Did anyone send me mail?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ithought the point of a strike was to cut off the
oppressors from what they want from you."
Evenia Callseah nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "Share. We're nice people."
"Maybe a key from Tobias?" Morris Corlew shakes his head at Sarah Bellamy.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Oh wait, huh? What did someone want?"
Morris says to Eli, "No."
Evenia says to Eli, "All your damn artifacts!"

gonna kidnap."

work either."

We cannot let this alliance turn into a dictatorship led by someone who does not
seek what is good for everyone! First he wants to remove us from the Accord,
which is humanity's last best hope for survival, now he seeks to intimidate our
citizenry!"

later."
Morris says to Eli, "Kinda like participatin in a hobby."

tossed at us."

Alliance or eAOS."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Not unless they meet our demands and I give them to
them, but ok."
Morris says to Lily, "It's still taxed."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Because someone from the AEU turned them in,
they will still share the findings with the AEU."
Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey shrugs. "It's done now, I'm not gonna throw them in the
trash."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "And the AEu will receive a bit of the
credits for the find, and the AEu will be the ones crediting you with the
points."

Nicolette Lawrence asks, "I thought Best had this super-high approval rating?
Who's he having trouble getting to do what he wants, other than his pilots?"
Damien Alexander says, "That's what I keep sayin'."
"We still do'nt know if they are using weapons." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey shakes his
head. "But even if they are spying or something, the suits are still
intimidating."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells,
"Civilian pilots, you have a voice! Don't let the president turn you into an
unlawful police force. You are not mindless machines, and neither are the
citizens of the Union! Speak up against this horrible new "peacekeeping"
taskforce, and speak out against all of the other policies enforced by the
president that you don't agree with!"
Damien Alexander says, "The approval rating's probably faked."
Damien Alexander gestures vaguely.
Morris says to Nicolette, "Whoever beheaded that chairman on Hyperion."
Evenia Callseah says, "Damn right they are."
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a
groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The approval rating is bullshit."
Evenia Callseah absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.
Damien Alexander nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "See, watch this. "seventy percent of pilots think
eli is a pretty normal guy""
Sarah Bellamy grins.
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods northeast.
Nicolette says to Eli, "You're not normal."
Patriot Constantine Stone walks in from the east.
Patriot Constantine Stone walks west.
Evenia says to Eli, "That's so wrong, it's 85.374% of pilots."
Nicolette says to Eli, "You're okay, but you're not normal."
Nicolette Lawrence laughs.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Morris Corlew yells, "Constantine."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Nicolette Lawrence.

You wave to Nicolette Lawrence.
Morris Corlew says, "Ah well."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Constantine, we're by the security office, inside the spaceport."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
oops."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "DON'T EXPLOIT OUR PILOTS TO DO YOUR
WORK FOR YOU BEST! WE'RE HERE TO DEFEND AND TO PROTECT HUMANITY. WE ARE NOT THE

Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
Morris says to Constantine, "We're so loud and creatin such a ruckus...ya just
overlooked us."
Sarah Bellamy laughs.
Morris Corlew grins.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Stop the

Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Katina Faye walks northeast.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Morris Corlew yells, "Battlesuits are
for use against enemies. AEU citizens ain't the enemy!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides east.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells, "We
all can stop this, if we stick together! If we fight for what's right by
standing firm, and launching peaceful protests on all AEU holdings! Don't let
anyone intimidate you! Don't let anyone force you to do something that you know
is so wrong, and using powered armor to threaten the citizens of the union is
wrong!"
Nicolette Lawrence says, "Well we need new shirts now. Only I don't know what to
call these, Stop Outccord was easy."
Katina Faye walks in from the northeast.
Sarah Bellamy grins.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Best

A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey
Constantine you might want to remove your spacesuit so you can hear us or er if
you don't want to?"
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Nicolette Lawrence says, "I thought that one up all by myself."
A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a
groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.
Patriot Constantine Stone removes the components of his spacesuit and places
them neatly into a dark orange flightbag with a white lightning bolt on the
side.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the east.

Nicolette Lawrence says, "I miss that new pilot action figure."
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods southwest.
"It's okay." Evenia Callseah pats Patriot Constantine Stone on the back. "At
least you didn't turn up in your pajamas this time."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Hey, those are stylin'"
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's
shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its
surroundings.
A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a
groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Every inch

Damien Alexander laughs.

Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Nissi Valdaire.
Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire.
Evenia Callseah grins at Nissi Valdaire.
Nicolette Lawrence says, "I'm surprised he doesn't have the sanitation drones
doing what he's wanting the pilots to do already. They could probably be
repurposed."
Damien says to Nicolette, "Don't give him any ideas."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "The Union
is being taken away from it's citizens bit by bit. Asking pilots to police you
with battlesuits is the latest step!"
Evenia Callseah shudders. "That's a seriously horrible thought."
Morris Corlew says, "Probably could."
Johann Schraft says, "Better start campaigning for drone rights if he doesn't
listen to you."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Morris Corlew says, "They used to be programmed to uh...well yeah..."
Morris Corlew says, "Ahem."
Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew.
Damien Alexander says, "Yeah."
Morris Corlew says, "That's nightmare images right there."
Katina Faye raises an eyebrow at Morris Corlew.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Don't

Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "I thought they were repurposed enforcer drones?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Thought I read a headline about that."
Nicolette Lawrence nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.
Morris says to Katina, "You uh...wouldn't wanna know..."
Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Nicolette Lawrence says, "That's another possibility. But at least we can fight
those, if he tries that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As far as I recall, I believe these have
always been sanitation drones but they used to do some terrible things."
Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "That's what I was talkin
bout."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I don't even want to mention it."
Morris Corlew says, "Which is why I didn't..."
Evenia shakes her head vigorously.
Katina Faye takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.
Damien closes his eyes and shakes his head. "I remember..."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "The man
inside wants pilots to patrol the streets in mechanized armor! Is this how the
citizens of the Union should be treated?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But anyway at least they keep the trash
under control. The tourists around here are prone to just dropping everything
especially around the aquarium."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "When I ran past you guys I saw that citizens
are still protesting Outccord by the courthouse."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "So that's something."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Wow that's great!"
Morris Corlew says, "Oh cool."
Katina Faye says, "Sexy."
Johann Schraft exclaims, "Nice!"
Damien Alexander grins.
Evenia Callseah says, "Hell yeah."
Katina Faye takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I wonder if we should be riling them up."
Eli says to Constantine, "Wait, they are?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey exclaims, "Nice!"
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, there's like a throng gathered outside."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I never knew any citizens ever showed up."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "With signs and everything."
Morris Corlew says, "Cool."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll be right back."
Morris Corlew stops leaning against the doorjam of the security office.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides west.
Morris Corlew says, "I wanan go see."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.
Katina Faye walks west.
Morris says to Eli, "I'll take a pitcher."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah I kinda want to too."
Morris Corlew lumbers west.
Eli says to Constantine, "Did you blow up more ships?"
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I meant to ask you the same."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "The numbers were nuts."
Katina Faye walks in from the west.
Morris Corlew lumbers in from the west.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah, I'm not sure how it's even lower than when we
blew up those ships."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I assumed you must have blown something up."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Unless Vernos blew up all his ships in
secrecy."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Nah, not me."
Morris Corlew says to Constantine, "All I see are the anti-Tandem idiots."
Morris Corlew says, "And the signs we hung up."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well damn, that's a shame."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I saw some groups out there."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "And kids handing out signs."
Morris says to Constantine, "The ones hangin up them red signs are the
anti-Tandem idiots."
Eli nods sadly.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I thought the kids were hanging the anti
outccord signs."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves in from the east.
Morris Corlew says, "Nope."
Morris Corlew waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Aww."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'm sure the Kelsey thing has really poured fuel on
their fire too."
Evenia Callseah waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins and waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Allo, I am protestater."
Morris Corlew nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "Unfortunately."
Patriot Constantine Stone asks, "What happened with Kelsey?"
Johann says to Pierre-Louis, "You're a prostate?"
Morris says to Constantine, "He's a provisionary member of the Tandem Pact."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I have at least one of those."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "He's a probationary member of the Tandem Pact."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, right."
Johann Schraft grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Er, yeah what Morris said."
Evenia Callseah smirks at Johann Schraft.
Johann says to Pierre-Louis, "I'll take your word for it."
Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "Be a prostrator."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys asks, "You think the nice fellow over there will
take me as a peacekeeper?"
Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "No."

You wave to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "NQ suit is perfect for peaceful peacekeeping
duty, I assure fine folks of AEU as I drench them in syrup."

Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I actually suggested a peaceful NQ parade
earlier."
Morris Corlew says, "Hey."
Evenia Callseah grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Morris Corlew says, "That uh."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Syrup mods only."

You chuckle.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Yes."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Don't

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys asks, "Which planets is he sending battlesuits on?
Juste Hyperion for now?"
Katina Faye takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I'm not really sure. The officer is stingy with
details, and signing up just to find out wasn't a good idea."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "We thought."
Nicolette Lawrence says, "He'll be enlisting all the soldier felo from the
sanctuary."
Johann Schraft says, "Well, does he want someone in a fringe five with rockets
equipped rollign past his headquarters? I would assume he doesn't."
Evenia blinks rapidly at Nicolette.
Evenia says to Johann, "I know I wouldn't."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "If we knew we could find out,  and abort the mission
without alunching it would be one thing, but they seem to like entrapping folks
into it."
Constantine says to Johann, "Yeah, probably not."
Morris Corlew nods to Johann Schraft. "Don't think he thought that through too
well."

You peer west...
[New Earth; Spaceport East]
This part of the spaceport has a fresh new look. Numerous pilot services are
available from the facilities here, including from the new Unreality Programming
office to the south, where a bold green and white banner announces: 'Employment
Opportunities! Apply inside!' Next to it, the spaceport's ship store competes
with a brand new flashing sign reading: 'Ship Sales! Don't be grounded!' Between
them, nearly hidden behind a potted plant is a wide stairway leading downward to
a lower level of the spaceport. A small sign near the stairway reads: Aerial
Fortresses and Supply. Other areas of interest here are the Fund Center to the
northwest, the pawn shop to the north, and the trading center to the northeast.
You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest,
and down.
Katina Faye finishes off a hot cup of espresso.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup they're busy out there."
'Busy out where?
You ask, "Busy out where?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Eli says to Lily, "Isn't it the same ones as before, the Tandem Pat folks?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well and there's always that one guy who's hanging
up a pro-Garner sign."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smirks.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I couldn't tell. It was a pretty mixed
bunch and more than one group."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.
Morris Corlew says, "It's the same ones that are generally there."
Morris Corlew says, "With those danged red signs."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The plaques are still up too."
Damien Alexander says, "I like starships at least as much as muffins."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Damien Alexander.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "If I could fly a muffin, I would."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But only if it had a lot of failsafes."
Damien Alexander laughs at Patriot Constantine Stone.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

Evenia Callseah says, "Starships and muffins are equal, as long as the muffin is
chocolate chip."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "A Muffin shaped starship would be nice. With a
muffin dispenser button."
Damien Alexander exclaims, "Fire the muffin cannons!"
Katina Faye blushes.
Evenia Callseah laughs.
Damien Alexander grins.
Eli says to Katina, "Don't worry, I think we've moved into general muffin
discussion."
Evenia Callseah says, "No no. What we need is that muffin ship with muffin
cannons, but also choco grapeshot cannons. That shit hurts if it hits you in the
head."
Damien says to Katina, "What, at least we're not talkin' about putting muffins
in boxes."
Evenia Callseah chortles.
Damien Alexander glances around at his surroundings.
Damien Alexander says, "Yet."

Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs at Morris Corlew.
Evenia giggles helplessly.

Katina Faye speaks into her cinnamon brown touch einrophone:
Katina Faye asks, "Join us?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's neck.
Katina Faye speaks into her cinnamon brown touch einrophone:
Katina Faye says, "Okie dokie."
Eli says to Katina, "You have to say it in a hypnotic,  eerie tone."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "OUTCCORD MUST STOP! SMAAAAAASH IT RIGHT
NOW!"
Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator,
"Just the other side of the bridge. Can't miss us."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

Damien Goss steps in from the east.
Nicolette Lawrence says, "So it's possible."
Sarah Bellamy grins.
Sarah Bellamy says, "Yep."
Tanny Hill swaggers in from the east.
Souleater the little striped orange CatBot trots happily in after Tanny Hill
with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.
Morris Corlew says to Nicolette, "Goss didn't. Tanny won't."
Morris Corlew says to Nicolette, "See?"
Tanny Hill asks, "What?"
wave tanny
You wave to Tanny Hill.
Tanny Hill glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.
Morris Corlew says to Tanny, "She said you might miss us."
Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and
watch, "You okay?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "OUTCCORD IS A FAILURE! WELL SO IS
BEST!"
Damien Goss grins at Katina Faye.
Nicolette Lawrence rolls northeast.
Katina gasp and jumps in surprise.
Katina Faye says, "Oh."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Best
wants to use fear to silence you! Stand with us! Don't let him get away with
using lethal weapons to police his people!"
yell Stop Outccord and stop battle suits in the streets!
You yell, "Stop Outccord and stop battle suits in the streets!"
Nicolette Lawrence rolls in from the northeast.
Morris Corlew says, "Guy told me to scram. Wasn't exactly rude bout it...but he
wasn't nice either."
Tanny Hill says, "So I assume we're protesting... yeah."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.
nod tanny
Nicolette Lawrence says, "Well I guess I told him."
You nod to Tanny Hill.
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "the
Best administration wants to use pilots in battlesuits as part of their so
called peacekeeping force. civilian pilots should not be used as police and
citizens should not have to live in fear of these heavily armed machines. If you
are a pilot, then do not take this step towards a dark future. If you are a
citizen then stand up and make your voice heard against this treatment. We must
change the path we are headed down before it's too late".
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "That not nice guy."
Sarah Bellamy glides northeast.
Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet
hiss of hydraulics.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident absently bobs her head up and down like a space
parakeet.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Gonna have to feed my kids folks. Be back in
a bit."
Sarah Bellamy glides in from the northeast.
Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet
hiss of hydraulics.
Sarah Bellamy nods.
Goss says to Katina, "Sorry, I guess it wasn't a very funny joke."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Johann Schraft yells, "The only suits
on the streets that aren't legal but should be are birthday suits, not
battlesuits."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys applauds sedately.
Sarah Bellamy laughs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers for Johann Schraft!
laugh
You laugh.
Evenia Callseah applauds at Johann Schraft.
Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
Katina laughs quietly and shrugs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I am gonna go apply for peacekeepership."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves northeast.
Tanny Hill asks, "Have we confirmed exactly what they want us to do?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves in from the northeast.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Wow. Apparently I'm
now a top conquest performer. Okay then?"
Morris says to Tanny, "Not us. Just AEU pilots."
Tanny Hill says, "I know."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "He called me a lanker. I am unsure what
lanker is."
Morris Corlew says, "Um."
Tanny Hill says, "I'm trying to be all unified and shit."
Sarah Bellamy says, "Wow. He didn't call me anything."
Patriot Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't
sweat it. You probably just turned in a core or something."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah roam the streets in battlesuits as
they throw flaming coctails and bottles and bricks and who knows what."
Tanny Hill says, "Huh."
Tanny Hill says, "Well then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Huh. I did turn in
two earlier today, as it happens."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I sure don't want that shit touching my
battlesuits."
Katina says to Morris, "May I have aplaq?"
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "He also said he did not deal with traitors.
I think there is a link there."
Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Tanny Hill asks, "Can we offer our battle suits to the brick throwers?"
Morris says to Lily, "That 'shit' won't hurt your battlesuit as much as your
battlesuit'd hurt the brickthrowers."
Tanny Hill says, "Wait no."
Sarah Bellamy says, "He just told me to move along and that he was only
authorized to deal with AEU pilots."
Tanny Hill says, "Bar idea."
Tanny Hill says, "Bad."
Morris says to Katina, "I ain't got none."
Morris says to Katina, "Eli made that one. I'd have to make all the
pieces...would take me awhile."
Katina Faye asks, "Could someone make a me a plaq if it's not too much?"
Lily says to Pierre-Louis, "Too bad how sad."
Tanny Hill asks, "Have we as civilian pilots openly condemned the murders and
stabbings yet?"
Johann Schraft says, "Raiatea give workbench."
Raiatea the arachnoid security robot says in a synthesized voice, "Order
confirmed."
Raiatea the arachnoid security robot removes Johann Schraft's workbench from a
compartment and gives it to Johann Schraft.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "He is a traitor to us!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Lost a turret in the
fight though. So I had to buy a full turret repair at new earth. Wasn't too
pricy though. I need to eventually get more done to get an asteroid hauler so I
can make more cash. I like cash. It's good. Helps me get things I need to
survive."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I do dislike random beheadings."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squints.
Tanny Hill says, "I really don't want to get lumped in with those assholes."
Johann Schraft puts down Johann Schraft's workbench.
Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "Better if they're less randomized?"
Damien Goss nods.
Nicolette Lawrence says, "I tried talking to him, got told to move along. So I
suggested an activity he might engage in with himself."
Johann Schraft stands before Johann Schraft's workbench and gathers various
supplies, then skillfully assembles them into an unetched transparisteel plaque.
Patriot Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We're
out protesting the latest whatever the hell if you want to come join us."
Patriot Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just
west of the bridge."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles at Nicolette Lawrence.
Morris Corlew chuckles at Nicolette Lawrence.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Katina Faye giggles at Nicolette Lawrence.
Damien Goss says, "You should never just randomly distribute violence. It should
always be well targetted."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Like sit on it and rotate?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'll be there in 10
seconds. Maybe 30 at the max."
Johann Schraft stands before Johann Schraft's workbench and gathers various
supplies, then skillfully assembles them into an unetched transparisteel plaque.
Evenia Callseah laughs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Nicolette Lawrence laughs.
Patriot Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No
worries, we'll be here a while."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Well, yes, but there has to be better ways
than removing heads."
Damien Goss nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Morris Corlew says, "Absolutely."
Jacob Shields marches in from the east.
Morris Corlew waves to Jacob Shields.
Evenia Callseah cheers for Jacob Shields!
Johann Schraft nods to Jacob Shields.
Lily nods sadly in Pierre's direction.
Damien Goss says, "Of course the security guards would shoot you just as dead if
you just tried to kick Best in the balls."
wave jacob
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "Best
wants to use the pilot corps to oppress you! Show him that you won't stand for
his bullshit!"
You wave to Jacob Shields.
Johann Schraft removes an unetched transparisteel plaque from Johann Schraft's
workbench.
Damien Goss shrugs.
Johann Schraft removes an unetched transparisteel plaque from Johann Schraft's
workbench.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh but I'd like to..."
Johann Schraft asks, "Who wanted a plaque?"
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells,
"Citizens and civilian pilots, speak up now before it's too late! Do your part
to stop the president's new "taskforce" from intimidating our civilian
population into submition!"
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Katina Faye.
Katina says to Johann, "I didd."
Johann Schraft gives an unetched transparisteel plaque to Katina Faye.
Jacob Shields nods.
Katina says to Johann, "Thank you sir."
Johann Schraft picks up Johann Schraft's workbench.
Johann Schraft gives Johann Schraft's workbench to Raiatea the arachnoid
security robot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.
Johann Schraft says, "No problem."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Either way, this whole traitor thing brought
up by navy person makes me curious how close they are to other nice navy person
admiral Janus by now."
Damien Goss says, "I think I have a good slogan, if you want me to etch that one
Johann."
Johann says to Goss, "Birthday suits, not battlesuits?"
Evenia Callseah laughs.
Johann Schraft gives an unetched transparisteel plaque to Damien Goss.
Damien Goss shakes his head.
grin
You grin.
Tanny Hill says, "Hey so."
Lily looks at Pierre and says Hmm well I hope I find her and if I do ...
Evenia Callseah says, "But that might scare them in a whole different way."
Morris Corlew says, "I think Kennedy's the only one mission."
Morris Corlew says, "Err."
Tanny Hill asks, "Has the League considered offering asylum to Hyperion?"
Morris Corlew says, "Missin."
Damien Goss says, "If you feel underfoot, blame Best. He's got multi-ton powered
armor trying to step on you."
Jacob Shields says, "Whatever best is doing is not something I can get behind.
I'm all for helping to maintain peace, but not if it's to help our president."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Deploy tugs to pull Hyperion near different
star."
Damien Goss says, "Or step on your rights."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh a use I have for Annie."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Tanny Hill says, "Or the people of Hyperion."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "That is a lot of people."
Damien Goss says, "If you feel underfoot, blame Best. He's got multi-ton powered
armor trying to step on you and your rights."
Damien Goss nods.
Damien Goss says, "There we go that's better."
Tanny Hill says, "I know it's a lot of people, but if civil war breaks out."
Jacob glares coldly at the entrance to the security center and flexes his
biceps.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Jacob Shields.
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Morris Corlew pats a sanitation drone lightly.
Jacob Shields says, "They want us to do their dirty work for them? Fuck that
bullshit."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "First
Outccord and now martial law? Who is Best working for? Demand accountability!"
Damien Goss says, "It's also a devious ploy to break your strike by getting you
to work in your armor to dissuade people."
Lily says to Jacob, "Yes yes they do and waste our battlesuits on their dirty
work."
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods southwest.
Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.
Damien Goss says, "Because striking isn't just about making profit, it's
stopping all work, period."
Tanny Hill asks, "Also, why did we choose this spot?"
Nicolette Lawrence sighs.
Morris Corlew gives Damien Goss a thumbs up!
Sarah Bellamy asks, "Because it's in front of the security office?"
Lily points to the security office.
Damien Goss says, "The security center is where the pilots go to join the task
force."
Jacob Shields nods.
Damien Goss says, "So, blockade."
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Tanny Hill says, "Aha."
Lily says to Tanny, "Look at that pompous-looking dude in there."
Johann says to a sanitation drone, "Clean up your government, Don't let best
program you the way he wants."
grin
You grin.
Tanny Hill says, "Gotcha."
Evenia Callseah pats a sanitation drone lightly.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's
shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its
surroundings.
Morris Corlew yawns.
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods southeast.
Katina Faye programs an unetched transparisteel plaque with some supplied tools.
A soft hissing sound fills the room as the instaetch compound begins to work.
Jacob Shields begins standing in front of the door to the security center with a
cold gleam in his eyes, his fists clenched and his back ramrod straight.
Katina Faye asks, "Is this okay?"
The hissing abruptly stops, and Katina Faye smiles in satisfaction at a
transparisteel plaque engraved with the phrase "We should defend humanity, and
not tear it asunder with strife. Let us protect each other, let us unite! Stop
Outccord, do what is right! Violence is not the answer, unity is where the
strength lies.".
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "He said I was a traitor, I do not know if I
will be able to fix damage to my psychologicalness."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Jacob Shields.
Jacob Shields nods.
Sarah Bellamy grins at Katina Faye.
Sarah Bellamy beams at Jacob Shields.
Jacob Shields says, "I like that."
Morris Corlew laughs at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Tanny Hill asks, "But okay, let's say that shit goes completely south and
Hyperion descends into civil war. What do we do from there?"
A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger
along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.
Katina Faye considers a transparisteel plaque engraved with the phrase "We
should defend humanity, and not tear it asunder with strife. Let us protect each
other, let us unite! Stop Outccord, do what is right! Violence is not the
answer, unity is where the strength lies." thoughtfully.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Support the revolutionaries and overthrow
Best."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I mean, maybe."
Katina Faye says, "If only."
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.
Johann Schraft says, "Getting outside groups involved in a civil war will not
end well."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Agreed."
Tanny says to Constantine, "What if those revolutionaries are murdering people?"
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "It seems like they definitely already have.
Hopefully they don't all stand for that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah they could be so I'm not into any sort
of violent factions whatsoever."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But that's something we'd have to find out."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I will frown heavily."
Jacob Shields says, "The only option I can see us having to work with if that
ever happens, is to help the people there in whatever way we can, but not to
give best more power. We should do so of our own free will. It is not in my
nature to allow others to come to harm where I might prevent it with the help of
my brothers and sisters in arms."
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Jacob Shields.
Morris Corlew says, "Folks generally die in wars. Civil wars pit brother against
brother, neighbor against neighbor."
Katina Faye hangs a transparisteel plaque engraved with the phrase "We should
defend humanity, and not tear it asunder with strife. Let us protect each other,
let us unite! Stop Outccord, do what is right! Violence is not the answer, unity
is where the strength lies." on the nearest wall. How lovely.
Patriot Constantine Stone nods to Morris Corlew.
Johann says to Tanny, "The best I think we would be able to do is to try to keep
it contained."
Jacob Shields nods.
Jacob Shields says, "Even then we'd have our work cut out for us, I'm afraid."
Tanny Hill nods to Johann Schraft.
Johann says to Tanny, "And again, that's probably not much that we can do as
civilians. That's a navy issue."
Lily says to Pierre-Louis, "Naa just eat lots of beans!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Morris Corlew says, "But patrollin the streets in battlesuits just can't be the
answer."
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods southwest.
Johann Schraft shakes his head.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I think that will only step up the violence."
Morris Corlew nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah it never will besides that is not what
they are designed for."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I think Eli should broadcast about this."
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "The task force, I mean."
Morris says to Constantine, "He's been plannin on it."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "People on our other worlds won't be happy about
it."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.
Patriot Constantine Stone nods.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "I will, yeah."
Jacob Shields says, "I agree. Civilians patrolling just doesn't look right in my
book. If anyone should be patrolling the streets, it's those who have served or
those who are serving now."
Tanny Hill says, "I personally want to press the League to have someplace AEU
citizens can flee to."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Better yet, the Accord."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Patriot Constantine Stone.
Morris Corlew nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.
Jacob Shields nods.
Sarah Bellamy nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah when I in the academy they never
taught us anything about law enforcement."
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods east.
Jacob Shields says, "Of course not."
Jacob Shields says, "If they had, things would be different."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The battlesuits I think were used against people
once. But that was like, terrorists who were full occupying a spaceport or
something."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Tanny Hill says, "Accord could help provide asylum, yeah."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I don't know too much, about that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well no I probably wouldn't have chosen
to be a pilot! Law Enforcement is not what I wanted to do for a career!"
Katina Faye looks at Jacob Shields thoughtfully.
Jacob Shields nods.
Johann Schraft says, "Politics neither, but we seem to be doing a lot of that."
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "Yeah, none of us signed up to be some
vigilante-esque taskforce."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Johann Schraft.
A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then
spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.
Sarah chuckles and nods at Johann.
Jacob Shields says, "I honestly hate politics."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I dislike politics."
Sarah Bellamy says, "I abhor it."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Johann Schraft says, "Poli means many, ticks are blood sucking insects."
Sarah Bellamy nods.
Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
Jacob Shields says, "Exactly."
Katina Faye grins at Johann Schraft.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods and laughs.
"It confuses me somtimes." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smirks. "I think I'm too
innocent for it."
Jacob Shields asks, "So with that being said, best could be a tick, correct?"
Jacob Shields giggles.
Sarah Bellamy nods.
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.
Jacob Shields says, "Aha. That explains why I don't like him."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Though, I don't think of myself as necessarily
innocent, I've been told that I am."
Morris Corlew looks at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey thoughtfully.
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I think it's your blue coloration."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "If you were red..."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "People might think differently."
smile lily
You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
squeeze lily
You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.
Tanny Hill says, "I have a love hate relationship with politics myself."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.
Jacob glances at the door to the security center. Upon seeing the officer
inside, he glares icily and his right hand twitches slightly.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Replicator
nests, bari, IFs weapons platforms, armored thralls, AEU citizens. One of these
things doesn't belong!"
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods west.
Johann says to Eli, "Yeah, now people just think you're depressed. That's why
they keep asking you why you're so blue."
Damien Goss asks, "Replicator nests?"
Evenia Callseah groans.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Damien Goss.
Morris Corlew says, "Rats."
Eli says to Goss, "RATS."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "But I didn't want people thinking Imeant rodents."
Damien Goss says, "No. I was guessing which one didn't belong. Nevermind."
Johann Schraft says, "And not the Jason variety."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh I get it."
Jacob Shields snickers.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "It was AEU
citizens! In case it wasn't clear! Do'nt use battlesuits on citizens!"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Citiznes
are pretty ok, using battlesuits on them is not ok!"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Yeah I wouldn't like to see what they could
do to someone who isn't similarly clad so do they want us to go out there and
murder people?"
Morris Corlew says, "Not all citizens are pretty. But all citizens are ok."
Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.
Sarah Bellamy chuckles at Morris Corlew.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Jacob Shields yells, "It is not we who
should be patrolling the streets! Leave that to the men and women who have seen
the true face of war!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives Jacob Shields a high five.
Morris Corlew says, "Less ya go after 'em in a battlesuit, then they won't be
pretty or ok."
Sarah Bellamy grins at Jacob Shields.
Damien Goss exclaims, "Don't let Best step on your rights with a battlesuit. The
point will definately leave you a little flat!"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "No doubt. I don't want ot think of what a gravitic
weapon would do to a human being."
Damien Goss says, "Shred."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Johann Schraft yells, "Best is trying
to put you in chainguns."
Morris Corlew nods.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "I do wonder
what that scanner is actually scanning for though."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident yells,
"OH GODS CHAINGUNS!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "I mean, it can't detect dissidents, right?"
Jacob Shields says, "Only the dead have seen the end of war. It is a poison,
nay, something far worse than that."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I assume it's some kind of listening device."
Morris says to Eli, "Takes one to know one?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey looks at Patriot Constantine Stone thoughtfully.
Jacob Shields gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Or, maybe you're right."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "More darkley."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'm pretty sure it's not a murderer detector."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Darkly."
Patriot Constantine Stone coughs.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Maybe it's a device Best just loads the
identities of whoever he wants into."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Patriot Constantine Stone. "Yeah."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It coul djust pop up with a designated target."
Patriot Constantine Stone nods.
Jacob Shields says, "By our very nature, we humans cannot have peace between
ourselves. And yet, this is what we strive for. Eventually, unless something
else happens, we will tear ourselves to bits."
Eli says to Constantine, "But I think you may be right though."
Jacob Shields says, "It's a scary thought if you ask me."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa yells,
"Everyone remember, this is not the only protest we have to hold, and is surely
not the only protest that we will be holding in the near future! We must do our
best to stop Outccord, and to stop the opression of Union citizens. We will hold
more protests, and you, the citizenry and other civilian pilots should hold more
protests as well. To a better tomorrow! To a better future!"
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Patriot Constantine Stone yells, "For
the Union!"
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Jacob Shields yells, "To a better
today!"
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Right, folks. I must dash off to bed, alas."
Patriot Constantine Stone waves to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.
wave ather
You wave to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.
Katina says to Ather, "Goodnight, Ather."
Sarah Bellamy waves to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Good night!"
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Best wants
to leave policing our streets to civilian pilots. Don't leave the poresting up
to us too!"
Damien Goss says, "Rest well."
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident yells,
"YES TAKE TO THE STREETS ALL OF YOU1 SOP OUTCCORD AND STOP BEST'S OPPRESSION."
Jacob Shields nods.
You fight the urge to cover your ears as Rogue Pilot Eli Grey yells, "Er..
protesting."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Hold the liiiine! For as long as you can.
Don't have to do a multi-day thing though."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa waves frantically!
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa strides east.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah Imean, I'm not sure I can stand here for days
again."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.
Sarah Bellamy chuckles.
Jacob Shields says, "Neither could I."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Besides, there's other things that probably should
be done."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Probably less chance to get beat up by
random person in spaceport. Is a big plus for the me."
Jacob Shields nods.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Tanny Hill sits down.
Johann says to Pierre-Louis, "Where are ham and eggs?"
Jacob Shields says, "I'd like to exist for a little longer myself."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well just bring a chair!"
Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "If someone tried to fuck with you right now, they'd
be in big trouble."
Eli looks around at the gathered crowd.
Damien Goss says, "Don't' worry Pierre. If they try to attack you, you can
always jump under the bridge."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or a floor cusion but I dunno, a bot might
steal it."
Jacob Shields says, "They can get under the bridge too, I think."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hmm I did some sifting down here a long
time ago and don't remember but I wouldn't be surprised."
Jacob Shields glances around at his surroundings.
Jacob Shields nods.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "There's condoms in there. Free ones."
Jacob Shields says, "I haven't tried sifting yet."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snickers.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Katina says to Eli, "Whuh?"
Lily says to Jacob, "Well there's no points in that but you can pawn the stuff."
Jacob Shields says, "That's lovely, I think."
Eli raises his eyebrows at Katina and looks a little embarrassed.
Jacob Shields grins at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

I will have to see where all of this is going. the last thing I want to do is
leave my brothers and sisters in arms because I don't like something. But if we
all do this together and work with each other it could work. Then I might
consider the offer. But as of right now I want to wait a bit and see how things
develop. No use in self-destructing the ship if you only have one turret that
can't be repaired, is there?

Right so, while it would be grand to take all the good AEU people in, something
like this would have to be done through our political channels. It's probably an
idea you'd want to discuss with government officials. Especially if you are
wanting to do it in massive numbers. While I believe anybody can ask for asylum,
it is up to the government whether to grant it or not.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Personally I think it would be a much better solution to fix the problem instead
of applying a bandaid solution by creating an entire refugee culture from

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

[Starship "Brahms Away"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.

[Starship "Brahms Away"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see

New Scotland Yard Prior to Museum Theft: 'Sorry for all the trouble, but it will

A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many
tendrils.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The museum did."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "The question was what has he
stolen from you?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Don't say it was a cake."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I do remember
that cake."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I'll even drop my accent for a
bit. He's blown up my ships a couple of times. More to the point, I work for an
alliance, which means their enemies are my enemies too."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He hasn't taken
anything personally away from me except for the Scout that Iloved, but doubtless
you'll point out that I didn't own that ship in the first place. I'm only trying
to figure out how stealing from some people, and not others, means someone isn't
a thief. You kinda have to not steal from everyone to do that."
[General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "You do not own any of your
ships. They are, in essence, long-term rentals."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "That's not brainwashing, Cheri,
that's loyalty, and pilots have been thrown in jail for breaking that loyalty."
[General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "This may come as a shock
to you."

Agnarr is particularly honest with his long-term rentalling."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Vote Agnarr."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Agnarr is fun at
parties."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So if they're only long-term
rentals, how long is the period of rent? Aside from it being cut off when or if
we retire, I need a date as to when I can be expected to return the ships I paid
for. Just for informational purposes, you understand."
[General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "They are until you are no
longer useful as a pet to your master, or whenever your master deems fit."
[General Communication] Jacob snickers softly.
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
[General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "It is truly sad that regs
accept all chains, but refuse to acknowledge their presence, as if they will go
away if you think that they are not binding or restrictive."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "No comment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Remind me why stupid
people exist again?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "It all depends on who's
doing the stealing whether it's good or bad."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You're loyal to the
governments that keep you enslaved, wonderful."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Look, I know that y'all have
flipped from being crazy anti-Kelsey to super pro-Kelsey, but what exactly do
you expect us to do?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Open your damn eyes."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm loyal to how I personally
feel about it. I just happen to agree with my government. I make my own
decisions. I don't change 'em 'cause a non-aggression pact is signed."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "If he wants to sit down and have
a conversation with us and the government, by all means, please arrange it."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "My eyes are wide open. Are
yours?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "To infuriate
those who have superior complexes in their own intelligence."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What
the."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm not the smartest
person in the universe. But I'm smart enough. I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I do not agree
with many actions of the fellow, but I am sure he would be great gentleman
during such conversation."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am pressed to
ask, What am I missing exactly? Or... tuned upon?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "For sure."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Yeah, apparently Takana said he
was great to talk to, from what I hear."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws beats
its claws together.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So have a buncha serial
killers throughout history from what I've read."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. either way, I'm
still a little disappointed that the guy doesn't have a monocle."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Why? Should he have one?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It just like..
shattered my whole perception."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You're obsessed with that
image, eli."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Belated greetings, Evenia.
How're you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So... what's
happening? Anyone doing anything of remote interest? I bought a fighter and not
certain I want to... how is that saying go? "...scratch the paint." on it yet."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Unfortunate
limitation of wearing ever changing holomask, maybe."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Not bad Jacob, yourself?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Whatever, he's not hurting
you pilots, think about it."
[General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Who's hurting what pilots?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Stop mouthing the words they
write for you, think for yourself."
[General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Pardon?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think for myself. If the
League signed a non-aggression pact with Kelsey, I'd still detest him. I just
wouldn't shoot at him."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I would be
curious on how many sentient beings Monsieur Kelsey is at least somewhat
responsible for demise of. I would be surprised if number was that high, to be
honest."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Wait wait.. so me saying that
bacon is awesome isn't thinking for myself? whaaa?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yo."
[General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am mildly curious, as
since this seems to be a very public conversation. Would someone care to fill me
in? It's pretty dull painting hulls of ships."
A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles
around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're not up
to much because most of the alliance is on strike against our oppressive
government. We're not pressuring new pilots to join in of course, we all know
how it is when you are fresh out of pilot school."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "They tell you who you can
kill, who you need to hate, and you do it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Care to meet to
discuss this and why? Also... what's the difference between capital insurance
and exploration insurance?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can't even chime in
on any of this because this is kind of how I do actually fel about my government
at the moment."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I am very careful about not
killing anyone."
[General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "And hey, Kelsey's ships aren't
his either."
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many
tendrils.
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I hate killing myself. Killing
is bad."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just 'cause I agree with 'em
bout some things don't mean I'm brainwashed."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wow
this Triggs or twiggs guy or whatever his name is, sounds like Vernos brother!"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok
i'm going to move some soldiers from daisy may into the other ship and wait to
see if they thrive and then in a couple of days I'll put the rest of them in
there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sure, let me
come to New Earth. And captial insurance is basically the best you can get,
exploration I think is much the same, although it will still pay out if your
insurance gets dropped due to you being on an expidition or something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They way it's
still covered if the ship gets blown up in deep space."
tr org Ah, ok. Yeah, he kind of does
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Ah, ok. Yeah, he kind of does."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Huh. It's 3000 in
difference. The capital being more, or course. Which, is funny, considering."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The
exploration one might not payout as much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Claims pay out is
75%, just like the capital. Wonder if there is a loophole regarding the
exploration insurance.."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Question for Cheri and
Pierre... did you guys used to say Kelsey is horrible?"
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a
yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

filling.

division of Accord."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Check um.. dustry Reaches, or even the old
frontier."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah."
Johnathon says to Tanny, "SVP? Accord?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep Space Vermin is the place! But do all
of the tasks that the Liaison wants you to do as well."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Just jump to space vermin command, that's a good way
to do some early pilot work and still be supporting the Accord."
Jacob Shields nods.
Jacob Shields says, "I still do this stuff myself."
Jacob Shields says, "Easy and it gets me cash."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "Where is space vermin command?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then when you are ready to do Ground
Combat, there are books in a box in the Conference Room on Ground Combat."
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Eli nods and grins at Lily and you.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll also be here to answer questions too."
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.
A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then
they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.
Eli sighs at the agnry pilots.
Tanny Hill says, "Space Vermin Patrol Command keeps everyone's space clear of
menaces like giant space bugs and out of control robots, while Accord deals with
things like malevolent aliens."
Lily points toward SShule and says now Shule is our amazing Space Combat expert.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Space bugs and out of control robots?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smirks at Tanny Hill.
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

Tanny Hill says, "I'm just a great pilot translator."
Tanny Hill beams.
Johnathon Triggs says, "I am still not hearing specifics for potential
targets..."
Tanny Hill says, "Sorry."
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.
Johnathon Triggs asks, "Where is Spacer Vermin Patrol command?"
Johnathon Triggs says, "And.. accord."

You sit down on a slim and fashionable couch.
Johnathon says to Tanny, "Not through the stars, in a spacesuit?"

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate
cream filling.

selection of accessible choices, but Accord won't show up on that at first."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate
cream filling.
Jacob says to Lily, "Good choice on the snack."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Also jumping to places like Old Frontier, and Dustry
reaches are good places to look for RATS."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Tanny listens intently to Jacob's melody.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As well as Spinward, C-12 sometimes, Battle
of Mir sometimes too."
Tanny says to Jacob, "What key's that in?"
Jacob continues to play a grand piano with a black finish and slightly moves his
body from side to side as he does so. The music floating through the room is
quiet and somber, yet with a slightly romantic mood.
Jacob Shields says, "I'm playing in d-major right now."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "What if there's none there, when I jump to the sector. I
just wait around?"
Lily says to Johnathon, "You could but I'd move on and check others."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "You can try a different one, or you can navigate out
by flying to an edge and then moving off manually."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "But yeah, probably easier just to jump somewhere
else that there might be RATS."
Tanny begins to pick at a metallic black bass guitar, creating a slow, steady
bassline to underline Jacob.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "And the folks at SVP will tell you where to go on
their missions."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep they sure will."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances at Jacob Shields and glances at Tanny Hill and
grins.
A seagull flaps by the window.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "That damn seagull."

about it all night, in a lounge."

the neck of her guitar as it emits the deep, rich notes.
Johnathon says to Lily, "By the way.. from your prior remarks. I take it you
take care of all the paperwork?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Or insectoid aliens."
Lily says to Johnathon, "Which paperwork?"
Johnathon says to Eli, "I'll hack the robots and make them serve me."
Johnathon Triggs grins at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

rather like that."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I play mostly acoustic and very old music
which our family passed down from way back on Old Earth but I'm not as good with
classical music."
"Those are on Accord Command." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "Might want to try a
rental fighter from Tannhauser Gate if you are goign to try one of those this
early though."
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then
spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "They're a bit more upgraded than the stock fighter."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "Or, are they only granted after so many space defense
points are earned?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And if you get destroyed, they won't affect
our goals as much."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I... don't know? I think you can do them right
away."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Did you all discuss Courier work and Mail
deliveries?"

Jacob concludes his peace and removes his hands from a grand piano with a black
finish's keyboard.
Johnathon says to Eli, "Your recommendations for courier services?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "You can request mail from the mail center, and you
can also get a corporate job doing deliveries as a courier."
Lily says to Johnathon, "Well mail will get you a bit of good cash and Courier
work only pays you a paycheck once per week but it's a good way to earn points."
Jacob Shields nods.
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well, personally, I work for Scientia over in the
Muttering Deeps, on artifact Zeta, but you can work at any of the courier jobs
that you want."

got a Trannsport so now whenever I do courier, I just take freight."

I think one book left on Asteroid Mining but please put it back when you've read
it. I think that book is out of print now."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon says to Lily, "I'll be sure to look into that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "So there is certainly a variety of work
for us to do when we work!"
Johnathon Triggs nods.

or scared the holy crap out of him!"

"The Raven" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.
Jacob says to Tanny, "Also, random thought, but I'd guess that this is at least
a 9-foot concert grand. Maybe a little larger than that. But the sound is just..
wow. such warmth and clerity."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Jacob Shields.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Pretty strong you are to heft that
thing around too!"

Phoenix."
