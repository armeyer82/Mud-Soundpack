01:38 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:38 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

Subject: Where does beacon payout come from?
Author: Something_Wicked
Posted: Thu Apr 19 19:54:09 2018 UTC

I would like to know where all the money comes from when it goes to us, where exactly the money the government gets from our beacons comes from and where that goes, and how this all works with Accord and Steel Phoenix and pilots affiliated to one, the other or both. If I missed anything, feel free to tack on a question.

01:43 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a
01:43  dingling bell, a small dusky pink trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a bag of felo treats, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

01:43 The timekeeping systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

01:44 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Ifts at 285."

01:46 Oh no! You currently do not have any proteges!

01:46 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

01:46 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:46 You exit the ship.

You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

01:46  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a stormy pair of trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

01:46 You are carrying nothing.

01:48 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]

01:48 The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The two-person Accord gemini "Battlesuits Not Birthday Suits", the augmented explorer "Oracle", and the two-person Accord gemini "Hummingbird's Glory" are landed here.

01:48 You wave to Damien Alexander.

01:48 Damien Alexander waves to you.

01:49 You say to Damien, "So where's everyone garthered at?"

01:49 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

01:49 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

01:49 The two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 712" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

01:49 You say, "I mean, gathered at."

01:49 The vostok-class capsule "Highland Flyer" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

01:49 Damien Alexander says, "Liaison Lounge. It's around the northwest bend."

01:49 The reactionless drive of the vostok-class capsule "Highland Flyer" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

01:49 Ted Warburton exits from the vostok-class capsule "Highland Flyer".

01:49 The vostok-class capsule "Highland Flyer" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

01:49 You say, "Ah, ok."

01:49 Ted Warburton says, "Hey."

01:49 Damien says to Ted, "Heya."

01:49 You say, "I'll make my way there."

01:50 [The Torus; South Concourse]

01:50 Here at the southernmost part of the Main Concourse, a bank of large windows provides a view of the opposite side of the Torus. Spacious, well-lit corridors follow the curve of the station around to the east and west, while another wide corridor leads south toward Docking Bay Alpha. Faint jazz music drifts down from a restaurant upstairs, accessible via a circular stairway in the center of the area, and to the side is an unobtrusive doorway marked 'Liaison Office' which you can GO into.

01:50 Though the curving walls and floor of this spacious corridor seem to be made of bare gray metal, the walls, meeting seamlessly overhead in an arched ceiling, glow softly with a pale white light, and the floor is such that it muffles even the heaviest footfalls. On either side of the corridor is a row of tall windows that provides on one side a glimpse of the inner curve of the opposite side of the Torus and, on the other, the sight of the starry black space beyond the station.

Ali Candan is dozing on a soft black leather sectional sofa. Keegan Wantz, Cheri Lindbergh, Morris Corlew, Tobias Hawthorne, Nissi Valdaire, Evenia Callseah, Kani Kahakai, and Damien Goss are sitting on a soft black leather sectional sofa.

01:51 The walls glow softly in this small room, casting into great contrast the blackness of space beyond the tall window in the far wall. Around the edge of the room is a long sectional sofa upholstered in buttery soft black leather trimmed in silver, and in the center is a sleek black table. The door is open.

01:52 Cheri says to Pierre-Louis, "Maybe he was avoiding."

01:52 You say to Melinda, "Asleep in her ship apparently."

01:52 Evenia looks as if she's about to say something, then just shrugs, closing her mouth.

01:52 [Tactical Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "No idea, I didn't look."

01:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Probably."

01:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "But let us never speak of it ever again."

01:52 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:52 Melinda Michaels gives Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys a thumbs up!

01:52 Cheri says to Melinda, "I get that feeling."

01:52 Morris Corlew speaks into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator:

01:52 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Could try to land on the watchtower and shoot at 'em."

01:52 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I mean have had that feeling myself before."

01:53 Morris Corlew says, "He seemed more focused on gettin his turtle suit than this stuff...and even then kept gettin me to organize things."

01:53 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

01:53 Melinda Michaels says, "Lets move on."

01:54 Melinda says to you, "We'll give her a few minutes before we fill you in real quick."

01:54 You nod. "No problem."

01:54 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I gotta say I know there's the new decon I think in the airlock, but the idea of coming back and spending ages in quarantine is like, please no."

01:54 Nissi Valdaire says, "One time Damien passed me in a corridor and didn't say good morning, this all leads back to that."

01:54 Nissi Valdaire nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

01:54 Evenia Callseah grins at Nissi Valdaire.

01:54 Nissi Valdaire says, "I've seen enough of quarantine."

01:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "A few cycles ago Nissi bought some tea at lounge and did not say hi to me. The emotional scars from this event might compromise the mission."

01:55 You say, "Ok."

01:55 Evenia Callseah giggles at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

01:55 Melinda Michaels laughs at Nissi Valdaire.

01:55 Tobias Hawthorne stands up from a soft black leather sectional sofa.

01:57 Melinda Michaels shrugs.

01:57 You chuckle.

01:58 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay, later."

01:58 Tobias says to Damien, "Question."

01:58 Melinda Michaels places an indigo slider einrophone into an indigo reinforced plastic phone holster.

01:58 Damien says to Tobias, "Hmm?"

01:58 Cheri says to Melinda, "I have a mutuality brawler 2 if you really really need me to do something in it, I just know for sure there are lots of people better than me at ground combat."

01:58 Tobias says to Damien, "Can you make holsters?"

01:58 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "My exciting League suit setup with no armor should carry us far."

01:58 Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:59 Melinda says to Cheri, "Take it just in case you need it. We do have lower tier crews that are good to work with."

01:59 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Okay then!"

01:59 Melinda says to Cheri, "Thanks."

01:59 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "I can do reverb with the best of them!"

01:59 Ted Warburton wanders in from the southeast.

01:59 Evenia says to Melinda, "Speaking of battlesuits."

01:59 Cheri Lindbergh chortles.

02:01 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Proper use of the thong is vital for mission."

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Sure, will ask next time."

02:03 Ted Warburton nods.

02:03 You nod.

02:03 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "The Outsiders must not see us or they must be destroyed utterly."

02:04 Melinda Michaels says, "If we have to battle the outsiders, the objective is to not let one get away. It could hamper things badly."

02:04 You nod.

02:04 Melinda Michaels asks, "Any questions?"

02:04 Ted Warburton asks, "This is to the thing that was in the news the other week?"

02:08 Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't know."

02:08 Melinda says to Pierre-Louis, "Actually, Nissi will probably need to just get her ship on your suit then someone can land her to launch the galleon."

02:08 Damien Goss asks, "Know what?"

02:08 Nissi Valdaire says, "I mean. Hmmm."

02:08 Melinda Michaels says, "Um."

02:08 Melinda Michaels says, "Her suit on your shp."

02:09 Damien Goss says, "I think I caught all the important parts."

02:09 You grin.

02:10 Melinda Michaels says, "I wish battlesuits could go to temp stations. People would be crazy with GMG though."

02:10 Ted Warburton asks, "Hmm, do we want lasers on my Muty rather than chains then?"

02:10 Cheri Lindbergh says, "You left out the part about the cans, but that's okay."

02:10 You say, "YEah."

02:10 Melinda says to Ted, "Quad laser is great."

02:10 Damien Goss says, "I honestly couldn't make heads nor tails of that part of the conversation."

02:10 Ted Warburton says, "It is, I'll make the switch."

02:10 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Damien Goss.

02:10 Melinda Michaels says, "You can use chains if you like though. We just have to be careful with supplies."

02:10 Damien Goss says, "I prefer bottles, or shot glasses."

02:10 Damien Goss grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

02:11 Ted Warburton says, "That was my thinking."

02:11 Morris Corlew says, "Quad laser."

02:11 Keegan Wantz says, "Pew."

02:11 Morris Corlew nods.

02:11 Damien Goss gives a sheet of white paper to Morris Corlew.

02:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "Anyway my thinking is we'll all pile into Pierre's galleon, or us suit people anyway, then land on the temp. Then I'll shuttle myself back to Earth and get my galleon. Then one way or another we'll get people in the right ships."

02:11 Damien says to Pierre-Louis, "Want one?"

02:12 Evenia Callseah puts a sheet of white paper in a small black leather zip pouch.

02:12 Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.

02:12 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

02:12 Ted Warburton says, "I might need to board a bit early if that's at all possible."

02:12 You say, "Same here."

02:13 Evenia Callseah says, "I did ask Pierre that earlier. I sadly did not get an answer. Till he spoke about my lovely panties."

02:13 Evenia Callseah grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:14 Damien says to Melinda, "Has it been floated to create a minimodule pool?"

02:14 Ted Warburton says, "If I got on the ground ship, someone could move me if they need to."

02:14 Melinda says to Damien, "Nope."

02:15 "I like that idea." Evenia Callseah nods to Damien Goss. "I would be willing to contribute."

02:15 Morris Corlew says, "Me too."

02:15 Damien Goss says, "I think that would optimize our chances should we have to go on ground offensives."

02:15 Melinda Michaels says, "Yo."

02:15 Morris Corlew nods.

02:16 Morris Corlew says, "I've got quite a bit of stuff. Will just shove all the useful bits in my suit."

02:16 Evenia Callseah says, "True. But depending on your crew, you might need a minimod you don't own. Or...I just figure be prepared."

02:16 Damien Goss nods to Evenia Callseah.

02:16 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

02:16 Ted Warburton says, "Sensible I think."

02:16 Melinda Michaels speaks into her indigo slider einrophone:
Melinda Michaels says, "Keep them in your suits though. Just let people know you have them."

02:16 Blake Madison walks in from the southeast.

02:16 You wave to Blake Madison.

02:16 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "You can fully determine how to get back based on it. I can show both of y'all later if you'd like."

02:17 Damien Goss gives a sheet of white paper to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:17 Evenia Callseah says, "I'll bring whatever I have that might be useful. In some cases they're only singles, but a single is better than a slap in the face with a wet noodle."

02:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Oh, hey, thanks."

02:18 Damien Goss nods.

02:18 Ted Warburton says, "Exactly, I'm the same."

02:18 Damien says to Keegan, "Want one?"

02:19 Ted Warburton says, "I'll go in whatever I'm needed in, although I think AEOS would be my favourite of all if this is anything like the Turtle was, but, Muty has reps so."

02:19 "I do." Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "But we can talk about it later. Unless you want it now."

02:19 Melinda says to Evenia, "Later works."

02:19 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "You can also fight amongst yourselves to determine who is best fighter pilotes."

02:19 Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels.

02:19 Pierre-Louis says to Melinda, "Did fightercrafts get selected yet?"

02:19 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I won't be in that argument for sure."

02:19 Melinda says to Damien, "Mail a copy to Anfisa please."

02:20 Evenia Callseah says, "I don't need to compete in that. I'm decent, but not anywhere near most of these guys."

02:20 Damien Goss says, "Ah."

02:20 Melinda Michaels nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

02:20 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Been a while since I saw a bastille."

02:21 Damien Goss says, "Yeah I guess that could have been an important fact I should have added to the notes, sorry."

02:21 Blake Madison says, "I've never flown one."

02:21 Morris Corlew says, "Great ships."

02:21 Evenia says to Pierre-Louis, "Well you see. It's like a fighter. But..."

02:21 Nissi Valdaire says, "There's two bastilles and a corvette in there right now, and room for a bit more."

02:21 You exclaim, "Bastfilles are awesome!"

02:21 Melinda Michaels says, "I've got two to put in."
Ted Warburton says, "They are."

02:21 Melinda Michaels says, "Then our ship for naughty pilots."

02:22 Damien says to Melinda, "Do you need donation ships?"

02:22 Kani Kahakai says, "I do not need a pod ride home."

02:22 Melinda says to Damien, "We don't."

02:22 Damien Goss nods.

02:22 Ted Warburton says, "I should probably get one for mine at some point."

02:22 Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew. "I think I am in love with that plant."

02:22 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Not sure how mothershiping works for the handshake thing."

02:22 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Be sure to not send bad people back in ship."

02:23 Melinda Michaels says, "I think you can unlink."

02:23 Damien Goss nods.

02:23 Damien Goss says, "Hit the mothership button in the control room."

02:23 Evenia Callseah says, "Hit the...yeah."

02:23 Damien Goss says, "Of the mothership."

02:23 Damien Goss says, "Or."

02:23 Evenia Callseah sighs at Damien Goss. "In my head...again."

02:23 Ted Warburton says, "You can select a destination in a pod should you need to as well, I'll never forget that lesson."

02:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Galleon will be mothership of fortress."

02:24 Damien Goss says, "Just amek sure the person you are sending home doesn't link with the mothership as it launchs."

02:24 Melinda says to Pierre-Louis, "With Ted, it looks like we are fullly crewed."

02:24 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys whistles.

02:25 Melinda Michaels asks, "Oh?"

02:25 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "Bikini-clad aliens?"

02:25 Blake Madison asks, "What dream is that?"

02:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Playing ping pong with two galleons and Outsider patrol."

02:25 Melinda Michaels laughs.

02:25 Morris Corlew grins.

02:25 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:25 You chuckle.

02:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Unless patrol is not dumb."

02:26 Morris Corlew says, "Dumb patrols are the best patrols. Unless you're the patrol."

02:26 Morris Corlew grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "We will have to see what fwoof look like."

02:26 Kani Kahakai says, "Fwoof-Foom is a very handsome name for a people."

02:26 Melinda Michaels says, "It is."

02:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Children of the sun simply did not have bikini modeling potential that was hoped for."

02:27 Morris Corlew says, "I keep thinkin the name sounds fluffy or fuzzy or somethin."

02:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Even if they like basking in light very much."

02:27 Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew.

02:27 Ted Warburton says, "I can see this being a word for blowing things up, or popping in the future."

02:27 Blake Madison says, "Popping for havingg a ship destroyed never sat right with me."

02:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I will be very clad if translation device work, trying to talk with childrens was very awkward."

02:28 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:28 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Gonna run out of charge if we have to spend a grand cycle drawing things."

02:28 Ted Warburton says, "I more use popping for suits, and boom for ships."

02:28 Melinda Michaels says, "I hope this all goes well and we make some new allies."

02:28 Morris Corlew says, "Me too."

02:28 Blake Madison nods.

02:28 Damien Goss nods.

02:28 You nod.

02:28 Ted Warburton says, "Me too, any allies we can make are welcome for me."

02:28 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

02:28 Evenia Callseah nods.

02:28 Tobias Hawthorne nods.

02:28 Blake Madison opens a black canvas Fringe gear bag for a moment.

02:28 Blake Madison puts a sheet of white paper in a black canvas Fringe gear bag.

02:29 Evenia Callseah says, "For the record, I'm totally cool with them being fuzzy allies."

02:29 Morris Corlew grins.

02:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I have hard time believing aliens that destroyed a mothership will like us at first contact."

02:29 Morris says to Evenia, "You can't make 'em pets."

02:29 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

02:29 Evenia Callseah laughs at Morris Corlew.

02:29 Blake says to Evenia, "Yes, do not bring any tonic with you."

02:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Unless they are the peaceful but very defensive type."

02:29 Evenia says to Morris, "Friends Morris, friends."
Morris Corlew laughs.

02:29 Ted Warburton says, "This may be true, we might need to show them our good intent."

02:29 Damien Goss says, "I am purposefully trying not to make a preconception of their appearance."

02:29 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah and nods.

02:30 Tobias Hawthorne picks up a copper photocopier.

02:30 Tobias Hawthorne puts a copper photocopier in a white leather backpack with a brushed steel buckle.

02:30 Kani Kahakai says, "Be prepared for anything."

02:30 Damien Goss exclaims, "I mean what if they're bald or something? How ghastly!"

02:30 Damien Goss grins.

02:30 Evenia Callseah shrugs. "I'm not really either, it's more what the name sounds like."

02:30 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

02:30 Kani Kahakai says, "Including them not being fuzzy at all."

02:30 Tobias Hawthorne grins at Damien Goss.

02:30 "Speaking of bald, did you like your gift?" Evenia Callseah grins at Damien Goss.

02:30 Melinda says to you, "No felo, lizards are fine. And, how many aquariums do you guys have?"

02:30 Damien Goss says, "I didn't open it."

02:31 Blake Madison says, "1."

02:31 Blake Madison says, "Nothing's in it."

02:31 Ted Warburton says, "3, but I can make sure they are OK."

02:31 You say to Melinda, "I have two, but Lily has like 4 I think."

02:31 Evenia Callseah says, "Well hell."

02:31 Melinda Michaels pokes Blake Madison in the ribs!

02:31 Blake Madison says, "What."

02:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I just remembered something important."

02:31 Morris Corlew says, "It's just a fuzzy, fluffy name is all."

02:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "This mission does not have blessing of President Best."

02:31 Melinda says to you, "That's a lot of aquariums."

02:31 Damien Goss says, "I lied, I opened it and no. It was girly."

02:31 You nod to Melinda Michaels. "I know."

02:32 "Of course it was." Evenia Callseah nods to Damien Goss. "But I thought the feathers might keep that poor head warm. Just like the bow, you know."

02:32 You say to Melinda, "I could be wrong on the number that Lily has."

02:32 Morris Corlew says, "Awww."

02:32 Damien Goss says, "I have no problem at all heated my head."

02:32 Damien Goss says, "It's usually the other way around."

02:32 Evenia Callseah says, "And here I was, trying to be nice."

02:33 Evenia puts on a fake offended expression.

02:33 Damien Goss pokes Evenia Callseah in the ribs! "Stop that shit."

02:33 Damien Goss grins.

02:33 Melinda Michaels says, "I am thinking people may have to leave some aquariums home. If they won't fit in your rooms because we don't want them crowding the ship."

02:33 Blake Madison says, "Oh."

02:33 You nod.

02:33 Blake Madison says, "I just won't bring it."

02:33 Evenia Callseah grins at Damien Goss.

02:33 Blake Madison grins.

02:33 Blake Madison says, "COnsidering...since it's empty and all."

02:33 Melinda Michaels laughs at Blake Madison.

02:33 Evenia says to Melinda, "My one is all I'll bring. You know the one I always bring. My others are fine to stay home."

02:33 Morris Corlew says, "I have a bot feedin the one on my tug. Will probably have a couple folks checkin my own, so...could probably offer that."

02:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

02:34 Ted Warburton says, "I'll reset my robot on Sunday."

02:34 Blake says to Melinda, "Whose taking care of pets?"

02:34 Morris says to Blake, "I got room. Gel too."

02:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "Just whatever can fit in your quarters, keeping in mind you have a roommate who might also want to bring stuff. Speaking for my ship."

02:34 Melinda says to Blake, "We can put yours with ours since you just have the one."

02:34 Blake Madison nods.

02:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "If we don't come back by time robot stop feeding, we will probably run out of charge."

02:34 Damien Goss nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:34 Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.

02:34 Evenia Callseah says, "I can care for pets as well."

02:35 Ted Warburton says, "Felo are more of an issue, because they need more intervension."

02:35 Evenia Callseah says, "But um, might be better to take Mel up on her offer. She doesn't have the whole felo world."

02:35 Ted Warburton says, "The wild ones."

02:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "You can put one aquarium in the galley of my ship, but the fishes might go missing over time."

02:35 Blake says to Pierre-Louis, "Are you going to eat them?"

02:35 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "That is joke."

02:35 Morris Corlew says, "Mmmm."

02:36 You grin.

02:36 Morris Corlew says, "Fried fish dinner."

02:36 Evenia says to Pierre-Louis, "No eating my fishies."

02:36 Pierre-Louis says to Evenia, "Hard promises."

02:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:36 Melinda says to you, "You can just fill Lily in then."

02:36 Evenia Callseah sniffles.

02:36 Melinda says to you, "You guys will be on Nissi's galleon."

02:36 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

02:36 Evenia Callseah says, "I hope the snappers bite your nose off if you try."

02:36 You say, "Ok."

02:36 Morris Corlew laughs.

02:36 Ted Warburton laughs.

02:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "We will rarely have had this many people for one journey."

02:36 You say, "I'll be sure to fill her in."

02:37 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Even imperator or explorer cannot hold that many."

02:37 Blake Madison says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I like the the other name better."

02:37 Melinda says to Ted, "And I'll let you know which. I need to see who has the who has the seat."

02:37 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Very exciting."

02:37 Ted Warburton nods to Melinda Michaels.

02:37 Melinda Michaels asks, "Everyone good?"

02:37 You say, "Yep."

02:37 Kani Kahakai asks, "Are xenofish safe to eat?"

02:38 Blake Madison nods to Melinda Michaels.

02:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Ewww."

02:38 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:38 Tobias says to Melinda, "Which ship will I be on?"

02:38 Damien Goss says, "Yes."

02:38 Ted Warburton asks, "Anything else we need to know, for, like, first, first contact?"

02:38 Morris Corlew says, "Gotta fry 'em up real good."

02:38 Melinda says to Tobias, "Pierre's."

02:38 Tobias Hawthorne nods.

02:38 Evenia Callseah wrinkles her nose.

02:38 Blake Madison asks, "Keys will go out and all that?"

02:38 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:38 Damien Goss says, "I haven't, but I know someone who has."

02:38 Evenia Callseah says, "I still have one from like...over a year ago."

02:39 Evenia Callseah says, "Pierre is very good at clearing keys."

02:39 Blake Madison says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Whoever that ship belongs to. I think it's the same person anyway. One of them is called hefty pig and it makes me chuckle."

02:39 Evenia Callseah pats Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys on the back.

02:39 Melinda Michaels says, "Just don't be crazy or stupid. We don't know anything about the Fwoof-foom."

02:39 You nod.

02:39 Ted Warburton nods.

02:39 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll be picking who goes out initially."

02:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Sometimes I clear all the keys."

02:40 Evenia Callseah grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:40 Ted Warburton says, "Don't clear your own key."

02:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Well."

02:40 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:40 Ted Warburton grins.

02:41 Lily Kaise does not seem to have an active communicator.

02:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Lizard people really did not like you eating."

02:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I dunno what their fwoofy neurosis will be."

02:41 Morris Corlew says, "Maybe they won't like hair. We'll all have to shave."

02:41 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

02:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Or maybe we don't have enough hair."

02:41 Morris Corlew grins.

02:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Bring a pallet of that hair grow thing."

02:42 Morris lifts his long mass of hair. "I think I'm good."

02:42 Evenia reaches out to Melinda, giving her a squeeze on the shoulder, then petting Zeus gently on the head.

02:42 Cheri Lindbergh stands up from a soft black leather sectional sofa.

02:42 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Later!"

02:42 Cheri Lindbergh waves.

02:42 Ted Warburton says, "Later."

02:42 Ted Warburton waves.

02:42 Evenia Callseah says, "I uh. Think I'm good with the hair."

02:42 Cheri Lindbergh walks southeast.

02:42 Keegan Wantz stretches.

02:42 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:43 Ted Warburton says, "I'll go with the hope they don't care approach and see what happens."

02:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "We will meet them naked in case they're offended by clothing."

02:43 Evenia Callseah says, "I do not wanna have to get all the beads out of this and the braids. I'll just chop it off if it comes to that."

02:43 Ted Warburton says, "Yep."

02:43 Morris Corlew chuckles at Nissi Valdaire.

02:44 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "A very good idea."

02:45 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:45 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Really, though, if they managed to destroy a mothership. They either have some amazing technology, are super warriors or master of subterfuges."

02:45 Kani Kahakai says, "If I have to shave my head to get there I'd rather stay at home."

02:46 Evenia Callseah blinks.

02:46 Melinda Michaels nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

02:46 Evenia Callseah says, "It's just hair. It grows again."

02:46 Morris Corlew pats Kani Kahakai on the back.

02:46 Melinda says to Kani, "Really?"

02:46 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:46 Morris Corlew says, "I shaved mine on a dare once."

02:46 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "We didn't really have any of those things. Just turned some crazy woman's murder suicide into an ambush."

02:46 Morris Corlew says, "Grew back even thicker."

02:46 Kani Kahakai says, "I mean, probably not, but I'd be really grumpy."

02:46 Lily Kaise does not seem to have an active communicator.

02:46 Melinda Michaels squeezes Kani Kahakai affectionately.

02:46 "I'd do it." Evenia Callseah chuckles. "It's not like it can't grow again."

02:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "That is true, maybe they just got lucky."

02:47 You wave. "Later everyone."

02:47 Nissi Valdaire says into her translucent metachannel FTL communicator, "No worries."

02:47 Ted says to Evenia, "You cut loads off at one point anyway, didn't you?"

02:47 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "No problem, glad you could make it."

02:47 Ted Warburton waves.

02:47 Nissi Valdaire glances down at her wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

02:47 Evenia Callseah nods to Ted Warburton. "Used to be around my ears."
Ted Warburton says, "Later."

02:47 Melinda Michaels waves to you.
Morris Corlew waves to you.

02:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "Isn't this meeting about to start."

02:47 Melinda Michaels laughs at Nissi Valdaire.

02:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Gonna assume they have spaceships at very least."

02:47 Melinda Michaels says, "This one got done fast."

02:47 Morris Corlew frowns at a mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator.

02:47 Damien Goss says, "Cliff notes version."

03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "What would you say is better? Filling the cargo bay with pieces of debris, or grappling debris chunks?"

03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Grapling is better."

03:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. I only ask because I get much less chunks of debris when I grapple. For example, only about 5 pieces fit in my cargo bay when I grappled over here, but when I salvaged, I could get about 10 pieces. Does the size matter?"

03:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "The debris that you grapple is worth more credits and points."

03:55 Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

03:56 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

04:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey everyone."

04:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Hello, Constantine."

04:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How's it going?"

04:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Good evening, Constantine. Or early morning, I suppose."

04:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

04:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool."

04:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Just let me know what I need to buy to prepare and not keep us waiting."

04:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure, you'll need a spacesuit and a supply cannon."

04:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. I'll head back to new earth and buy one."

04:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "One of each."

04:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a shop in the New Earth spaceport that sells both. Old Earth has more stylish spacesuits, if you care about that sort of thing."

04:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "I did see an interesting one last sunday. Hmm."

04:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "They sell flightbags in the same store. I recommend putting all the parts of the suit inside the flightbag, as it's quite a bit easier to manage."

04:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "What are flight bags?"

04:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's just a bag that holds your spacesuit."

04:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When it's time to suit up it makes it a bit easier to manage."

04:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Alright."

04:21 The sensor systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

04:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can also toss them into flightlockers for easy suit access while airlocks cycle."

04:24 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a
04:24  dingling bell, a small dusky pink trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo here.

04:26 A long chartreuse soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

04:27 Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo stares curiously up at you.

04:32 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

04:33 You stroke the soft fur of Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo.

04:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alrighty, let's haul a few rocks."

04:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be in the lounge."

04:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "On my way. It took me a while to find the pod station on old earth."

04:52 A small thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

04:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I have an itch to haul as well, presently. As such I think I shall head out west of the station, Constantine."

04:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay. Is the frontier processor open?"

04:58 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with narrow dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

04:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, why don't you guys haul together?"

04:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I fear not."

04:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "On the train now."

04:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "And I got a flight ag as well."

05:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I could take Elijah if you prefer. You might have a little more experience with the matter but it is rather straightforward."

05:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Barely, I've only hauled a handful of times. And like you said, it's simple enough."

05:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "The only thing I didn't get was a supply cannon?"

05:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can grab that on New Earth."

05:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Should I buy a dog repelent?"

05:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No."

05:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, dogs are something we generally wish to attract."

05:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Come again?"

05:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "As the boost asteroid value astronomically."

05:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They, rather."

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Constantine, how many people would you say we need to clear the processing station at the Frontier Cluster?"

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Or Ather. Anyone who's done it, really."

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "4."

05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ideally a tank suit, a repair suit, and two plasma suits."

05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Well, if you come with me and Casen, we only need one more person, right? Think we might be able to do that today?"

05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it would be possible, it just might take a while with the low-tier plasma suits you guys would be able to field."

05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Hmm."

05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Indeed. I think I'm somewhat locked into the AEU suit presently, too, unless I were to sell it and replace it with an EAOS."

05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't you have two slots?"

05:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

05:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Actually, we could probably manage it with a low-tier EAOS. I could bring my four, then we'd just need a tank suit."

05:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm working on something now and probably can't get around to that for about an hour, though."

05:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Ah. Hm. I ought to check. I thought I'd heard on comms that you gain a second slot at 250 license points, then another every 500 points after. I may have misunderstood, though, and never thought to look."

05:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That is true, but I thought everybody started with 2 now."

05:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cadets not included."

05:32 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

05:42 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

05:48 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.

06:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "It does look as though I have access to another suit slot right now, Constantine, you were right. Would you consider the plasma suit worth picking up, then?"

06:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I stand corrected."

06:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it's a pretty good choice for AEU pilots, makes cleaning the vents nice and easy."

06:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And for the time being we don't have tons of other options, since we can't get league suits."

06:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Unfortunately I spoke a little too soon. The option was there, but rather than purchasing a new suit it was to change the manufacturer of my current one."

06:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm."

06:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you try to SWITCH at the battlesuit outfitter you should see if you have an empty slot."

06:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No matter how many slots you have, trying to buy a new one in a filled slot will always replace it."

16:12 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

16:12 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

16:54 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:54 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

16:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

17:01 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:01 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)
