Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a
glass top here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, a robotic chef named Nellie, a small hot beverage dispenser,
and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I may
ask the office if the government would accept our input on van Dannikin's
replacement."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I figure
the worst they can do is just say no."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "No rush on it,
Jacob. Can pass it along next time we meet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Hey, it's worth a
shot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I
suppose it can't hurt."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
agree Constantine we need to keep showing our presence and above all speaking up
for ourselves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Eighty three
sectors traveled.. 3 artifacts found."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And awesome! I'd
just like to have the money in your hand ASAP. I'm back up to 9 mill after doing
some missions. Had to get a battlesuit and all that stuff, so yeah. Also finally
paid off that loan. Yay! Now to wait for my license."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Good
luck on that paperwork Jacob. I know it can seem to be a bit tedious."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Also we aren't doing
too well in terms of meeting our conquest goals."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And thanks, lily. It
sucks, I can say that much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
the bulk of the corps is currently on strike."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "However,
even before the strike, conquests during which we met both goals were rare."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That
is because we're on strike for the most part. Newer pilots aren't necessarily
participating. During better times, we do well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh shit. That I
didn't know."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No
no don't worry about that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just wait
until the strike is over, conquest is gonna blow up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It
sure will heh! If I feel like working again! I've enjoyed being very relaxed and
enjoying more out of life!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Any reason as to why
we're on strike in the first place? I don't have all the details, and I like
details. Details are good."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was
talking to Eli and I've been wondering if maybe we're approaching this from the
wrong angle."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "How so?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
wonder if maybe we should have tried to approach of trying to influence the
negotiations."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like if
we could actually get them to come to a deal, maybe this whole mess could be
avoided."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I've
asked if they'll take our input on the negotiatior, and we'll see."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
am not sure I think we still need to show major opposition. I don't think being
diplomatic will be heard very well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And I've not really
given myself time to relax. I hate being lazy, to be honest, even though it's
good sometimes. I'd rather bust my ass and try to make money to put towards
stuff that the alliance needs as a whole rather than do nothing at all and give
no help to anyone."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Cause
like one problem is that van Dannikin likely wasn't at all invested in reaching
an actual agreement."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know
what you mean, Lily, but I'm starting to worry that we have no actual bargaining
power."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like
what is striking even doing?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Hopefully making a difference, but who knows."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "As of
right now I'm sure it looks to them that no matter what we say, stuff will still
get done."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Our current
president is attempting to withdraw us from the Accord of Free Worlds, a
coalition of the three alliances that defends humanity. We tried official routes
to voice our concerns about this and were ignored and eventually attacked as we
tried more and more to talk about the negatives to leaving the Accord."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which
is unavoidable, but we need to work around that, I think."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Well speak with Eli and get his perspective."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So why does best
want to withdraw us in the first place?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
talked to him about it. I'll start by asking if they'll take our input. I expect
the answer will just be no, and none of this will matter."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But
we'll see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Which just
eventually lead us here, the Accord negotiations are on hold for the moment due
to a scandal, but it was stopped just days away from completion,  so we may
still not have much time."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Because he is a separatist."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh dear god."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The official
reason is that it will be good for the Union. That's about as far as the
explanation goes publiclly."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
real enchilada would be to convince them to send a coalition to lead. Maybe
Rebane, Culwyn, and someone from the NaPas."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This
way a scandal perpetrated by one guy like van Dannikin wouldn't bring the whole
thing to a halt."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But any
discussion on the matter is being completely shut out by those in power. They
won't even address concerns about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Good for the union
for us to leave the acord? Yeah, okay. Sure. I'll believe that when rats start
buying us beers in the local bar."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And the
whole government would feel involved."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "They want to
do this when theres still threats like the IFS, rats, bari, and outsiders too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've heard a
few things that would imply that it would be good for the Union on a very short
term, then get quite bad for all alliances, icluding the Union."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
ideally everyone should be worried it will go well in the short term."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Really, it's my
opinion that we need the accord, and they need us. Same with the other
alliances. We're more interconnected than we realize, I think. Even if we don't
particularly like each other, we still help each other out. So us leaving
wouldn't really be doing anyone a favor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The last
think we need as a species is for the Union to start doing well, and have all
the other alliances start to want to abandon the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Thing, I
mean."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cheers for Jacob Shields!
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Other alliances aren't going to get involved in our issues. The league would
probably rather see the aEU go under."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I mean, lets
not forget one of our military's flotilla got dangerouls close to mutality space
on 'accident', if I remember the headline right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "That can mean
a ton of different things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh man."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, that's
caused a lot of tension too, that they're blaming on us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And I'm guessing we
really didn't have much to do with it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We had
nothing to do with the actual navy movements, but we were involved in some
events following the incident that were influenced by the movements to a
degree."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Us as the
corps didnt. It was a miltary thing, but the thing is, our government treats the
mutuality as if they're still illegal unregs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, they're
blaming it on a meeting we had for skim access that didn't come to a deal. But
part of that meeting was the already present tensions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And the
government won't discuss any effect the movements may have had on anything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Perhaps
I should pass them a note about the siege on the Deep Wastes?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This is
something they might be concerned about."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "A group
of pilots from all alliances wasn't able to fully crew a cruiser to defend."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How
would we fare alone, if such a siege came to our doorstep?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That's not really a
good way to do things. I'll be the first to admit i'm not an expert on politics,
but I do know that what's going down right now is not healthy. It doesn't take a
smart person to figure that out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Probably not too
well, I'm guessing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's even
been a group of sepratists on Hyperion that want it to stop or to be granted
independence, things are certainly not well right now."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
the reason for the QSA failure isobviously not ours. It is because the AEU
Government even prior to Best won't do their job to negotiate with the Council
and it's clear they don't care to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Like I said,
our goverment doesn't want to negotate with 'unregs', most likely. Look what
happend to Lambert. That's one of their scape goats. Hopefully we can get him
reinstated."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But
they want to point the blame back at us when nobody from the AEU government even
bothered to show up when the original meeting occurred."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Which is totally not
cool. If you're going to be in any position of power, the least you could do is
to, you know, do your job. It makes everyone else's jobs, and lives for that
matter, a lot easier to deal with."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "People blame
the easiest to blame usually, Lily."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Playing the blaming
game doesn't help either. But we all knew that already."

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So
yesterday I was flying around looking at some stuff."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I
did find that Ather's book is just missing the long-range scout's speed bonus."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So the
only advantage the void piercer has over our scout is the extra 6 battery
hours."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which
admittedly is a lot of battery time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I don't think
the price is worth that six extra hours."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Oops. That."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Miscomm!"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
suppose it depends on how you want to use it. If you want to explore deep out in
space, I guess it might be."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But
yeah, it's expensive."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Unless
you meant you meant the price of not having guns."
tra org Nah, I don't think so. Especially since the void piercer has no weapons.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Nah, I don't think so. Especially since the void piercer has no weapons."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which
is heavy, indeed."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I also
saw read the Magnetar's description for the first time."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It sort
of makes me think Best financed its production."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which
is interesting."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Why's that?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It's
also interesting that the Magnetar is still up for sale, even though the Arrow
isn't."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
description is all about making the Union great again, and how this ship shows
we don't need other alliances to be successful."
tra org Yeah, it is, but the Explorer Corps no longer exists.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yeah, it is, but the Explorer Corps no longer exists."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
but it's weird that it's still listed at all."

them."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And
work at it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd love to go art
hunting some time. But I need to get more points and all that shtuff before I
even consider doing that."
tra org Yeah, we can certainly try.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yeah, we can certainly try."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
we just need to show that exploration is profitable."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which
is something we can do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "It takes a lot
of patience."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, but so does
living in general. *chuckles*."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
it would really help if we lead an all-AEU expedition."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Even a
small one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I've traveled
a hundred and three sectors, and from that? Four artifacts."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just to
show there are enough people in the corps interested."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ehh. That's not
fun."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It gets
better once you can cross a sector in under ten seconds."

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "To be honest,
if you think about it.. if most of the AEU civilian pilots went on this

[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sean, you want
three sensing arrays?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "We need to
plan ways to keep the crews attention to, since there are definetly slow periods
during expeditions. I learned that well on the expedition with Johann and
everyone. I had things to do, but it was real slow at times."
