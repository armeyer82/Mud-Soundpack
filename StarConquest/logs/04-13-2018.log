04:56 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:58 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:59 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:59 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:59 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

15:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:59 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:59 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

15:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:59 The starship is already moving.

15:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:59 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

15:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:59 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:59 I don't understand that.

15:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:59 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

15:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green.

17:06 You wave to Constantine Stone.

17:06 Say to whom?

17:06 You say to Constantine, "Hey there."

17:06 Constantine Stone says, "Casen was hauling some roids earlier today. Maybe we should think about setting up a station in 285."

17:06 Lily says to Constantine, "How's things?"

17:06 Constantine Stone says, "I'd say pretty okay."

17:07 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ah great!"

17:07 Constantine Stone says, "Melinda invited me on the EAOS trip."

17:07 Constantine Stone says, "She said you guys would be there as well."

17:07 Lily Kaise says, "Oh that's good."

17:07 You smile.

17:07 You say, "Yep."

17:07 Lily Kaise says, "We are going as well."

17:07 Constantine Stone asks, "Do we know when it will depart?"

17:07 Lily Kaise says, "No."

17:07 Constantine Stone nods.

17:07 You say, "Nope, not yet."

17:07 Lily Kaise says, "She jsut said in a few weeks."

17:08 Lily says to you, "Is that what you heard or did I hear incorrectly?"

17:08 You say to Lily, "Nah, that's what I heard too."

17:08 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

17:09 You nod and smile.

17:09 Lily Kaise says, "I'm surprise that as many aEU were invited."

17:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:09 You exclaim, "Me too, but I'm glad!"

17:09 Lily Kaise smiles.

17:10 Lily Kaise says, "It's a long trip. I don't know for how long exactly though so if we're gone for more than 30 days, we'll have to find someone to transport our ships every few days to feed them."

17:11 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, that is long."

17:11 Constantine Stone examines a shiny waterfall blue Professional Chef hot pizza synthesizer with chrome accents for a moment.

17:11 Constantine Stone presses a button on a shiny waterfall blue Professional Chef hot pizza synthesizer with chrome accents. The machine rumbles and whirs, and small blasts of excess heat escape the vents on the top, filling the air with the aroma of a pizza restaurant. Eventually, the dispensing area lights up with a cheerful ding, and a hot personal burger pizza slides into view. He removes it, and the light clicks off.

17:12 You nod to Lily Kaise.

17:12 Lily Kaise says, "Well obviously, if we can't repair a blast Chamber or set up a midway recharge station or stations, we'll have greater limitations on how far we can travel."

17:12 You say, "True."

17:13 Lily Kaise says, "We managed that really long trip down in the Feng wo Trading collective a couple years back because we stopped at Feng Wo station a couple of times to repair and recharge."

17:14 You nod to Lily Kaise.

17:18 I don't understand that.

17:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:19 Constantine Stone says, "I wonder what cool ships Melinda, Damien, and Pierre can get in the EAOS."

17:20 You say, "They can get an EAOS cruiser apparently."

17:20 Constantine Stone says, "Oh nice."

17:20 Constantine Stone says, "I wonder what that's like."

17:20 You say, "Me too."

17:20 Lily Kaise says, "I only have two pets currently and they can probably survive for a few months in the Platform but the other felo would probably run out of food in their food bowls a few weeks because the robot will stop feeding them after 30 days.nod."

17:21 You nod to Lily Kaise.

17:21 "Yeah, I am curious about that eAOS cruiser." Lily Kaise nods. "Before Pierre couldn't get a Cruiser becasue there is none for Mutuality."

17:22 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, they don't have one?"

17:22 Lily Kaise says, "No."

17:22 You say, "Nope."

17:23 Lily Kaise says, "They are a bit weaker in terms of defense than the other alliances."

17:23 Lily Kaise says, "But they do have other tech so."

17:23 You nod.

17:23 Constantine Stone asks, "Couldn't he have rented an AEU cruiser through invaders?"

17:23 Lily Kaise says, "Like the Stealth for the Galleon and other tech which I don't know much about."

17:23 Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, I've seen him mention that."

17:23 Constantine Stone asks, "What does the stealth do?"

17:24 Lily Kaise says, "I think it is like a cloak which may mask the signature of a starship."

17:24 Constantine Stone asks, "Is that the cloaking that that one tracking array can see through?"

17:24 Lily Kaise nods.

17:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

17:37 Constantine Stone says, "I've still never progressed to using deep borers and improved processors."

17:37 Constantine Stone says, "I would also have to get the next tier of transmission tower."

17:37 You say, "I use them all the time."

17:37 Constantine Stone says, "And build at least 8 more drones."

17:37 Constantine Stone says, "It seems like a hefty investment."

17:37 You say, "Nah, it helps."

17:37 Constantine Stone says, "But, my sites take 4 hours, so I guess it would make it faster."

17:37 Constantine Stone laughs.

17:38 Lily Kaise says, "I use enhanced processors only after just one Basic and 36 drones and up through the third tier everything but I don't go beyond the Deep Borer for drillers."

17:38 You say, "Mine take that long and I use bores and such."

17:38 Constantine Stone says, "You probably have way more metals than I do though, I imagine."

17:38 Constantine Stone asks, "You get more and more as you get more industry, right?"

17:38 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I have about 51k for Rocky and 60k to 61k for metal rich and so on."

17:39 Constantine Stone says, "Oh wow, that's twice as much as I get."

17:39 Lily Kaise says, "But I've been using this configuration for a long long time."

17:39 Lily Kaise says, "Let's see."

17:41 Lily Kaise removes a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

17:41 Lily Kaise examines a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

17:41 Lily Kaise makes a selection on a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser, and a sheet of white paper slides out of the slot at the bottom into her waiting hand.

17:41 Lily Kaise puts a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

17:41 Constantine Stone takes a bite of a hot personal burger pizza.

17:42 You say, "I actually use two different configurations."

17:42 Lily Kaise yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

17:42 Constantine Stone pats Lily Kaise on the back.

17:42 You say, "Oh dear."

17:43 Constantine Stone asks, "What do you use the two configurations for?"

17:43 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

17:43 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

17:44 You smile at Lily Kaise.

17:44 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

17:44 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

17:44 Lily Kaise gives a sheet of white paper to Constantine Stone.

17:44 You say to Constantine, "Sometimes, I can't spread out in one direction as much as I'd like so yeah."

17:45 Constantine Stone says, "Oh I see."

17:45 Lily Kaise says, "]I don't correct for the placement of the central Coordinator. It's never that far off so I just pretty much stay with this arrangement but the rule of thumb, if you want to be a perfectionist is to place the first tier of weapons 2 away form the coordinator as well as the processors."

17:46 You nod to Lily Kaise.

17:46 Constantine Stone says, "Hm, interesting."

17:46 Constantine Stone says, "So I find that the number of metals I lose to poachers varies really widely."

17:46 Constantine Stone says, "Some sites it will be a few hundred, sometimes well over 1000."

17:46 Constantine Stone says, "I guess my turret placement is probably bad."

17:46 You say, "I almost never lose more than 100."

17:46 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, wow."

17:47 You say, "Unless I'm just not paying attention."

17:47 You laugh.

17:47 Constantine Stone asks, "To keep it under 100, do you have to micromanage the site during poacher raids?"

17:47 You say, "Sometimes."

17:47 Constantine Stone says, "I basically never look at the site again after I finish setup."

17:47 Constantine Stone says, "Okay."

17:48 You say, "I usually stop operations and let them help defend."

17:48 You say, "But that's just me."

17:48 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I can see both ways."

17:48 Constantine Stone says, "If you want to maximize that's definitely the best way to do it."

17:48 Constantine Stone says, "Sometimes I just like to let it run while I stare at the wall though."

17:48 Constantine Stone chuckles.

17:48 You laugh.

17:48 You say, "Well, I stare at Lily, not the wall."

17:48 Constantine Stone laughs.

17:48 You laugh.

17:49 Constantine Stone says, "We should all do a nest or something."

17:49 You say, "Ok. I'll be back later."

17:49 Constantine Stone says, "Oh ok."

17:49 You wave.

17:49 Constantine Stone says, "See you later."

17:49 Constantine Stone waves.

17:49 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

17:49 You kiss Lily Kaise.

17:49 You stand up from a large leather couch.

17:49 Constantine Stone takes a bite of a hot personal burger pizza.

[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

23:29 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:29 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:29 The ship is already moving.

23:29 The ship is already moving.

23:29 The ship is already moving.

23:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:29 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:29 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:29 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

23:29 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

23:29 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

23:29 There are no other ships in the sector.

23:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "By the way, we really need an active Industrial Whip. Please... one of you! for the sake of the stars! run for that office next term."

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My office-holding days are done."

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe Casen can do it."

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We don't need an industrial whip. Run only if you want. It's a mostly worthless position."

23:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:30 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, agreed."

23:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:30 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:30 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It is but one can learn a bit while in the position."

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Plus, honestly, it was funny when Isaac was absent through an entire term the first time, and every successive time it gets more and more funny."

23:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The industrial whip only tends to send comm notices that we generally only pretend to read anyways."

23:31 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyways, hopefully my office holding days will soon be done too. Especially when I send my rudely-worded letter to those piles of shit who think they're going to try to control the civilian pilot program with their retarded corporations."

23:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I totally get that and agree."

23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I like how in the end the worst aspects of all the presidential candidates of the last term have all converged."

23:35 Your communicator reports that...

23:35 
At least two recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

23:39 I don't understand that.

23:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Casen did you find that control?"

23:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I'm just transitioning into the sector now."

23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Well. Shortly, I should say."

23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok Casen, once you engage the Transfer process, it will reuire up to around 10 minutes for your proceeds to be applied."

23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Require that is."

23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You don't actually have to be there for the entire transfer process, either."

23:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Ah, perfect. So now that I've begun the procedure I can just head off and it will automate the rest?"

23:58 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
