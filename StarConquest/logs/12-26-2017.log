00:14 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

00:14 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:14 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:14 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:15 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

00:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

00:15 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:15 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:15 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

00:15 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

00:15 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:15 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

02:17 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider c

02:30 Dear Mr. Elemmire,

Congratulations! We have decided to accept your application to purchase and operate an AW-2 AEU Flare-class Twin-Assault Vessel!

The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses had your application reviewed by the finest psychologists, and we also reviewed all records of your service as a pilot. At the conclusion of this process, it was decided that you were well qualified to operate this equipment.

Thank you, and we hope you enjoy your new acquisition!

Sincerely,
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses

02:30 --
Ather,
By now, i'm sure you are aware of the League's cessation of
Diplomatic Relations with the AEU. I honestly believe that this is
not just the AEU pilots response but moreso to do with a tendency
which I've observed amongst League pilots. Since I became a pilot, there has always been this hostile contingent within the League who have disliked the AEU all along and this was prior to the current state of politics within the AEU government. This doesn't mean that we should remain complacent and not try harder to thwart the current administration but the league are adept at acting upon what they can because they merely can and often without any rational basis. Case in point when Melinda lied about our meeting on andy's. She did not give me an opportunity to discuss the issues moreso to gain a better understanding of the issues. If I had it to do all over again, yes I would have tried then to negotiate with Johann to bring us back instead of the next morning. I was hesitant being that it wasn't my own ship which we were flying in and not under my iminent control. Johann had an upgrade to obtain on tom Town. We drifted off course on the way to Andy's so it took longer than usual for us to find the beacon. We really didn't just 'have fun' during this trip as once we got to Andy's we met with Melinda and immediately left for Tom Town where we recharged since we had expended most of the ship's charge aboard Johann's Galleon. 
02:30 Additionally,
I was representing the AEU and not the League and so Melinda
exploited this to her advantage.
You have already likely noted that due to the current circumstances, that for those of us who own
League Battlesuits, that they are not available to us now.
We've lost our access to perhaps not as much more
We've also been excluded from participation on building Temporary Space Station for not just SEAS but for all AEU organizations. Still, amongst the three organizations within AEU, we can certainly establish our own and I can tell you that LIBS will likely be
willing to participate with us as they were willing to when SEAS
was cut off before. However, i never asked LIBS to contribute.
I believe that we should explain to newer pilots
that we likewise should not contribute to work which generates
income to the League as well.
As current Temporary Space Stations which AEU organizations
contribute to go offline, I will certainly build our own. If
Invaders would like to participate, please let us know. We would
establish a Battle Scanner, A Salvage Processor, look for an
alternative Asteroid Cluster and if it's justifiable, a Xenology
Station.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

02:30 You nod to a sheet of white paper for some reason.

02:30 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

02:31 You say, "I just did."

02:31 You frown.

02:31 Lily Kaise nods.

02:31 Lily Kaise says, "'so we can no longer get the luna tracker."

02:31 You put a sheet of white paper in a leather briefcase.

02:31 You nod.

02:31 You say, "Wow."

02:32 Lily Kaise says, "They will suffer too though."

02:32 You say, "I sure hope so."

02:32 You frown.

02:32 You sigh.

02:32 Lily Kaise says, "They can't buy the JackRabbit and the Revo for one."

02:32 You say, "Well, they'll lose access to the revo."

02:32 You nod.

02:33 You say, "And they probably lost access to the pincer and bastille, mabye."

02:33 You say, "Maybe."

02:33 Lily Kaise says, "One can only hope."

02:33 You nod.

02:33 Lily Kaise says, "I was able to get us a mule for the org though."

02:33 You say, "Oh good."

02:34 Lily Kaise says, "That was sort of my test run to see what we could still obtain."

02:34 You nod.

02:34 Lily Kaise says, "Oops the mule neeeds a fort haha."

02:34 You say, "Heh."

02:35 Lily Kaise says, "So Even t for those of us who have qualified and bought and paid for League Battlesuits, we can't access them anymore."

02:36 I don't understand that.

02:36 You frown.

02:36 You say, "Wow."

02:36 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

02:36 Lily Kaise says, "So we're screwed with leading."

02:36 You nod.

02:36 You sigh.

02:36 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:36 Lily Kaise leans on you.

02:37 Lily Kaise says, "I hate to think of it but I know this is going to likely lead to conflict."

02:37 You say, "Of course it will."

02:37 Lily Kaise says, "So I also want not to fly this ship around much."

02:37 You nod.

02:38 You say, "It would be advisable not too."

02:38 Lily Kaise says, "I've been rather liberal but I don't trust them to not be aggressive towards us now."

02:38 You say, "Exactly."

02:39 Lily Kaise says, "So we have to be careful with running shihps which aren't easy to replace."

02:39 You say, "Exactly."

02:40 Lily Kaise says, "I had to put the Fringe Tracker on the mule. It will do but have to be careful of tracking more than 1 at a time as it can track 2 which I'm not a fan of."

02:40 You nod.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

03:12 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider c

I agree completely with what Melinda has stated in her previous post. Therefore, Allied Libertarians will not be including AEU parts on any of our stations either. We also do not wish to be a part of any stations the AEU may build for monetary gain.
As Melinda has said, if things change for the better, hopefully we can all start working together again in a productive manner.

Given the latest news, the decision has been made to not work with the AEU on stations at this time. Being as the League has cut off all diplomatic relations, we simply cannot justify aiding the current AEU government in any monetary gain opportunities. We sincerely hope this will help move the pilots and citizens of the AEU to make change happen. If things change for the better, we can open station sharing opportunities again. This is the view of the following organizations. Business Cats, Morning Star, Journey, and Spacial Stability. Other organizations will need to speak for themselves on this matter. Note that this means we will also not participate on any temporary station that will lend a hand in gaining Money or Resources to the AEU government. We are not trying to hurt the pilots but feel that this is an appropriate stance against the AEU government for the reasons that Nissi stated in her post. Let us hope they make changes and we can all work together in a productive manner.

04:15 Lily Kaise says, "Well heh all bets are off on Morris."

04:16 Lily Kaise says, "Because we're not bound by a NAP with League but we are with Fringe so we have to watch our tactics."

04:16 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

04:16 Lily Kaise says, "But I totally agree."

04:17 Lily Kaise says, "I haven't seen Johann once during the past day or so and so she is making a unilateral decision."

04:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

04:20 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

04:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

04:23 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

04:23 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:23 Lily Kaise glides south.

04:23 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

04:23 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:23 Lily Kaise dangles a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

04:44 I don't see "lilynod lily" here.

04:44 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:46 You say, "YEah, we do still have an NAP with Fringe, for how long, who knows."

04:48 Lily Kaise says to you, "Yeah, hard to say. Ironically, we've ourselves not had a lot of regard for the Fringe but they may actually be our last resort albeit I know we are too proud to want to rely on some other alliance at all!"

05:02 You say, "We shouldn't be though. We need all of us working together if humanity is going to survive."

05:03 Lily Kaise says to you, "How ironic right?"

05:03 Lily Kaise says, "They can't separate us pilots from our government."

05:03 Lily Kaise says, "They want to stereotype us."

05:05 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

05:06 You say, "I know."

05:06 You sigh.

05:12 You say to Lily, "If you do have to move about a lot. You might consider taking a clipper or an escort. Hopefully you can defend yourself in that."

05:12 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

05:14 You say, "I mean, fly around a lot."

05:17 Lily says to you, "That's a good point."

05:18 Lily Kaise says, "I'd also rather risk one of our ships than a ship that I can no longer obtain as well."

05:20 You nod.

05:21 Lily Kaise says, "I've actually just been traveling in the secondary gemini I bought because I didn't want to risk my other one which has Farport Upgrades."

05:21 Lily Kaise says, "We can still buy those."

05:21 You say, "Ah ok."

05:23 You say, "Well, one hit from a clipper is enough to break a failsafe."

05:23 You say, "On most ships. So."

05:24 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but I just don't seem to move as fast as you but you are very correct. I just don't want to wast my clipper."

05:24 Lily Kaise says, "Waste."

05:24 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

05:24 You nod.

05:24 Lily Kaise says, "Maybe I'll try to buy another one. I just won't have as good of a tracker."

05:24 You nod.

05:24 Lily Kaise says, "Or I'll get used to the Fringe one."

19:46 Lily Kaise says, "I keep looking over the kittens I find as Mischief will be gone soon and I like to have 2 or 3 of them around."

19:47 Lily Kaise says, "I saw a silver feathered but it had already matured and I prefer to get kittens because I think they do better with the tonic."

19:47 You nod.

19:47 Lily Kaise says, "I'd love a silver feathered one."

19:47 Lily Kaise grins.

19:47 You say, "YEah, that'd be cool."

19:47 You grin.

19:49 Lily Kaise says, "Well Hun, I'm sad to say but for the New Year's celebration, I doubt anyone will offer us a ride. If they do, then I'd still go."

19:49 You say, "And same for the NQ party."

19:52 Lily Kaise says, "Have to try to think positively."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch
20:01 ow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and gold aquatic life and coral rocks, a sheet of white paper, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317 here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
