Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 275."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
[0m04:10[0m
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

cargo. When I try to transfer, 'The computer reports that cargo is already being
transferred'. I've powered down and back up. Trying logging and relogging now."
[Newbie Help] Johann Schraft transmits, "That does sound like a bug. Maybe
support about it?"
[Newbie Help] Aya Navarro transmits, "Relogging didn't help, unfortunately.
There was a crash yesterday before I had to log; possible culprit?"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, a silky cerulean
cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons, a cup of hot French vanilla
coffee, and a cup of hot French vanilla coffee here.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean
cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.
ftl 275
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 275."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
[0m04:23[0m
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

[Newbie Help] Lily Kaise transmits, "The ammunition box."
[Newbie Help] Elaine Moreau transmits, "What is 'max engine speed' on main
battery? You'd think it's what it says, but mine has a max speed of 4000, and I
was going 5500 a second ago."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Max engine speed on the main battery is
the starting speed of the engine, well better put."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Better put, the lower of the engine's
starting speed, and the main battery's max speed will be the starting speed, as
you move a great enough distance you'll accelerate to the max engine speed on
the engine itself."
[Newbie Help] Lily Kaise transmits, "Right and it will depend on the engine you
have installed as well as the battery/Charger."

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.

The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 275."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
[0m04:28[0m
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this
area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the
distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

Four going home would overcrew the carrier by two. If Nissi does not have an
issue with this, that's fine. If you came in on the transport and have items
aboard, please grab them by 2200 tomorrow. If you are wanting to go home, let us
know by that time also. Otherwise, happy artifacting, stay safe and all that

wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are

Star Conquest Help: Metachannel Communicators
--
Category: Communication
--
Each character starts the game possessing a metachannel FTL communicator. This
allows people to transmit on the set of channels viewable only by their alliance
as well as the Tactical and General channels, open to all alliances. Also, the
Newbie channel is available through this device.
To use them, the following commands are used.  (Please note that you must be
wearing the communicator and it must be on.  It must also be YOUR communicator. 
Do not give your communicator to another player, or swap it.  This will stop the
communicators working, as they are assigned to the person in question both ICly
and OOCly.)
To turn the communicator on and off completely, the command TURN COMM is used.
To turn the Newbie channel on or off, NEWB COMM is used.
To turn the General channel on and off, GEN COMM is used.
To turn the Tactical channel on and off, TAC COMM is used.
To transmit on the Newbie channel, use the command TRANSMIT NEWBIE message (this
can be shortened to TRA NEWB message)
Example: TRA NEWB How do I communicate with people?
Result: [Newbie Help] Cameron Jellas transmits, "How do I communicate with
people?"
To transmit on the General channel, use the command TRANSMIT GENERAL message 
(this can be shortened to TRA GEN message)
Example: TRA GEN Hello.
Result: [General Communication] Darla Kinnington transmits, "Hello."
To transmit on the Tactical channel, use the command TRANSMIT TACTICAL message
(this can be shortened to TRA TAC message)
Example: TRA TAC There are Battle Thralls in sector 26!
Result: [Tactical Communication] Ella Lerini transmits, "There are Battle
Thralls in sector 26!"
The channels specific to your alliance are slightly different.
You can TUNE COMM TO NUMBER, where NUMBER is a channel number from 1 to 10, to
transmit on that channel using the command TRA message.
Example: TUNE COMM TO 1
Result: You tune a metachannel communicator to ALLIANCE | Channel 1.
Example: TRA Hello.
Result: [ALLIANCE | Channel 1] Faye Masters transmits, "Hello."
You can also TUNE COMM TO 0 (the number zero) which puts the communicator in
tuner mode, allowing you to hear transmissions on all of your alliance channels.
 However, this means that the command to transmit to those channels is slightly
different.  Since the comm is no longer tuned to a specific channel, you must
specify the particular channel number you wish to transmit to.
Example: TUNE COMM TO 0
Result: You tune a metachannel communicator to the ALLIANCE tuner.
Example: TRA 1 Hello.
Result: [ALLIANCE | Channel 1] Georgina Norrington transmits, "Hello."
You can also use social commands with your communicator by simply transmitting
the command, or emotes by transmitting a normal emote command.
Example: TRA GEN laugh
Result: [General Communication] Darla Kinnington laughs.
Example: TRA GEN :snorts and then laughs.
Result: [General Communication] Darla Kinnington snorts and then laughs.
Note that your character is physically speaking into the communicator -- anyone
in the room with you will hear any transmission made by you.
If you wish to have a private conversation with someone, your character will
need a device called an einrophone.

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Rapid Recharging Eatery &
Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.

fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the

and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean
cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

area of the sky, pointing the way Coreward.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Aerial fortresses do not actually go inside
the mule at all. They clamp to the underside, as implied in the text when it
detaches and reattaches. Though it is easy to miss and never really made
explicit anywhere! But now you know!"

It makes sense, but I hadn't thought of it."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "How do they avoid being shot during ship

general, cause I've always understood that docking with temp stations worked the
same way."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Through your very clever evasive flying.
Well done, Erik!"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Haha."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah chuckles.
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Ships do actually go inside temp stations."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hence the docking bay."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Though in the original version of them from
years ago, you could also attach docking modules to dock externally. But it was
never used because there was no real reason to ever do that."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I am learning more interesting things.
I like this."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Ah, okay. I remember asking when I was
new to the game and being told they just connect to airlock modules on the side.
I think my particular question was how it was that a station module transport
could carry all those modules and still fit inside a station. I guess the size
changes a lot once you fill the thing with atmosphere."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Now I'm curious who told you that. Heh."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "You know, I was pondering the whole mod
transport the other day, when we build 3 stations from one transport, and now
each of them holds many ships, including that mod transport."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Temp stations are made from expanding memory
metal and also partially just inflatable. Like rescue pods! I suppose that's
another thing not made explicit anywhere."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I always wondered that about rescue pods
too. Specifically because of capsules. Where the heck would you put a rescue pod
in a capsule?!"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The rescue pods being inflatable is in a
help file...somewhere."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh, in the aptly named rescue pods help
file."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Is it? I don't recall seeing that, but I
don't have them memorized...thank goodness."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My image of stations suddenly swelling
up like massive hot air balloons from that has made my morning. Thanks, glorious
mind of the squid."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew laughs. "Yeah, same."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "I suppose it does say that it pops out."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's hinted at in how the station has to
float a bit away from the ship before it comes online."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Memory metal is a real life thing, if you're
not familiar! Metal that has one shape, then transitions to a different shape
when a current is applied."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Now see I always thought that was just
because the station obviously can't occupy the same coordinates as the ship."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, they make eyeglass frames out of
the stuff."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Inflatable spaceships aren't that outlandish
either. The lunar lander had walls as thin as tin foil."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, they are trying to make more and
more that way."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Very cool."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I personally am familiar with it, but
hot air balloon stations in my head have now stuck."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I recall hearing that somewhere. So much
SC tech is not so far on the horizon or things I would so love to have."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "I've added a line to the temp station
completion message to make their nature more clear."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh cool. Thank you again!"
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Awesome, thanks, that definitely adds to
the flavour."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Very cool, thanks!"
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Cool, thanks. Now I can't wait to see
what it is. I like little changes like that."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "So do I."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "And I particularly appreciate that you
don't tell us about each and every tiny change, only the ones that actually
matter."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "I've also found myself adding an
unreasonably epic message for an asteroid processor docking bay when an asteroid
is delivered, because we were lacking one completely."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew laughs.
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah laughs.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "This I can't wait to see."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Me neither."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Same."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Is it add random message day? If so,
please continue to surprise us."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Hey, if you're adding messages, any
chance we could get a message for when you get transfered to the asteroid
hauling station cause the asteroid you were standing on got hauled?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Reminds me of all the requests to make
it so that wouldn't happen."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Heh, I could see a rather comical one
for that."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Not only am I sure you'll come up with a
fun one, but also I'm sure newbie's have been really confused about what exactly
just happened."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "And one for when you land in the mining
station from inside your virtual reality suit and you ended your mine maybe?"
[MTTS] lunadrell has joined the channel.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Doesn't that already have you take off
your suit and be in the room like normal?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That's what I thought too."
[MTTS] lunadrell: I like your sense of humor in the swashbuckler's cafe.
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "If it does, I don't see it, that needs
sorting then, which I will do."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean, obviously you know what just
happened. You ended your mine and took your suit off."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.

[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The point of the profile is to help you
with your roleplaying."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean, if you want to stay a cadet
forever, that's fine. But you will never have access to many things. You can be
a cadet forever if you want, but you will still want some points."
[Newbie Help] Dorothy Miller transmits, "But profiles are too hard."
[Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "And if we're being honest with
ourselves, people will respect/treat you better after you get past cadet, as it
shows you know what you're talking about."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "The profile is all about roleplaying,
even though it allows you to earn more points after you have it approved. For
further information you could of course always speak with the staff using a
support ticket, because they can give you more information on what you wish to
do than we can."
[Newbie Help] Lily Kaise transmits, "Also, if you consider a Profile to be too
hard, then how do you consider that you will be able to rP a well-developed
character?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Profiles are something that will allow
you to roleplay more, in a much more dynamic way. Yes, they can be difficult,
but you have a mentor and staff who can assist you. Pay close attention to what
staff tell you in their responses."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "The hard part, if you ask me, is
actually the character concept, I'm not sure how I would have got through that
bit to be quite honest."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wish we'd had that when I was new. It
would have saved me a good bit of frustration with my first profile being
rejected."
[Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "Its a blessing and a curse in that
once you get that approved first time, the 6 attempts at a profile are... a test
of pacients, to be sure."
[Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "I wish profiles were easier I need a
fresh new one."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "The profile is very helpful as a way of
giving you many props on which to base your RP, and act consistently."
[Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "No its not helpful for me, roleplay
for me is just imagining and exploring."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Imagine and explore your character, and
put that into a profile."
[Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "I do beautiful writing but not the
way its wanted here.\."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "I would always explain the profile as a
writing of who my character is."

[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "You won't be able to do certain things
that qualify as exploring without having to have others bring you along."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Imagine what you wish! The purpose of the
profile is just to make sure you have a clear concept and that it fits into the
game world. Many people drastically overcomplicate it, particularly with the
biography section."
[Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "The best bit of advice. Play the
game first, Play the game first. My first profile did not fit the game, at all,
because I just didn't know what I wanted katie to be. And listen to squidmind.
As that's probably me he/she is talking about, hehehe."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "And, they have made it possible to play
for much longer before you have to worry, which is a very good thing."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's a lot of us, Katie. My first
profile was nothing but biography."
[Newbie Help] Dorothy Miller transmits, "The way it seems to me the hosts make
it complicate it because I have done profiles where nothing seemed right and I
did not understand how to change to what they want, I know I am not good with

understand your frustrations. The best thing I can say is that it's truly worth
the difficulties you might face with the profile in the end. SC is honestly the
best space mud I've ever played. Try and work passed the issues you're having. I
promise the game world is worth it."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's ok. Just take your time, read and
reread what they have to say to you, and unless the entire things needs changed,
only change specifically what they point out."

[Newbie Help] Dorothy Miller transmits, "That is just it, I love love the game

[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Put what you're typing in a word
processor and save it, then when you have to try again, you'll be able to open
the document and modify it as directed and paste it all back into your next
profile attempt."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I don't remember who said this, but it
might help, when they tell you to change something, change that thing, instead
of completely throwing away the entire profile and starting from scratch."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "When you think that some people have
played for 7 years and more, straight, hopefully it helps you realise there is
no rush, if you have everything within a couple of years, what then?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you love it as much as you say, take
the time. Be patient. It will come. Staff is very good about working with us to
get it to something that works."

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean
cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.
[Newbie Help] Bryan Stout transmits, "Yes what everyone has said here. It
doesn't have to be super complicated. You can always talk to staff later to see
how your character is doing in their eyes, see if your style of play could
change in any way to reflect your profile, etc. Patience is key. It's also very
rewarding in the end."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Believe me, we really don't want it to be
complicated. Profiles are an incredibly huge timesink, which is a big reason we
added in one sentence concepts for approval first. If your profile is
approaching 500 words, you probably need to refocus. Personality is all we
really care about, how we can espect your character to react to the various
forms of drama and plot that are common in this game."

[Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "I know so far I've seen the staff
are quite against taking profiles IC, but if I may ask, would it be plausable,
to perhaps have them as paperwork, as that's what I've seen[not mentioning
names!], and that way the players, perhaps voice of the cores, can offer player
assistance to the other players, so that its not as much as a timesink for the

thing. I never saw my mentor!"

they'll often contain details or a certain level of self-awareness known to the
player but not the character."

others with them, though. As long as you're not writing it for them!"
[Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "Nodnod. I get that, It was just an
idea I had off the top of my head to lighten the staffs load, as it were. I was
going to see if Mr, squid liked it, in which case I'd write it up propperly, and
submit it to the staff on support."

[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Getting together and exchanging papers would
be the only way, really."
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Or using pastebin or something, I suppose."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I have had proteges send me their

profiles are a bit long to send to a mentor through the mentor channel. I have
sat with someone on a ship in private for a discussion that was ooc in nature to
help them clear up misconceptions and things, however."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Most times I've managed to help as a
mentor by asking the right questions."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can just paste it in dropbox and
generate a link, that's still anonymous."

[MTTS] alc_71: Maybe it could be possible to hold a Q&A profile session once in
awhile on this or another channel so that things could be monitored properly.
[MTTS] rosey: I want to have a char who likes to entertain with music and stuff
besides the other normal pilot activities but don't know how to write it so the
feedback giver can't say it looks like what I want to instead of what my char
wants.
[MTTS] usfolks: I like that idea, alc_71.
[MTTS] Squidmind: That's a good point to make; if you have someone else write a
profile for you, you're missing the point in why we have the profile system to
begin with.  As for helping someone refine theirs, asking them questions is the
best way to do that.  Giving any kind of solid answer about anything TO the
person tends to get misunderstood.
[MTTS] usfolks: Sounds fine how you wrote it. And as was said to me once,
remember that hobbies do not make the personality. Your char is more than their
love of music.
[MTTS] rosey: I know that.
[MTTS] Squidmind: We've considered doing a forum about profiles before, but the
big problem with that is that the people who would attend... would already
predominantly have approved profiles.
[MTTS] usfolks: Absolutely, Squid. Unfortunately some people don't want to do
the work themselves. And Squid, I wonder if we did one every month or so, would
that get the people who really need it...and also give the rest of us some
pointers in helping those who can't.

[MTTS] davetaylor: Liking playing music doesn't tell us how you might react in
RP situations, for instance, when you hate somebody and it's very obvious.
[MTTS] rosey: My feedback seems to confuse me even more because it often seemed
I did nothing right.
[MTTS] Carroll: I am good at creative writing but not the way its asked for
here.
[MTTS] usfolks: So if you like music, making music, and entertaining people,
while you can roleplay that, it shouldn't be because it's what you want.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Something like that is definitely something I'd attend. I'm
all for trying to help people.
[MTTS] Carroll: Sorry what do you mean its not supposed to be the way you want?
[MTTS] rosey: That is a good example of a confusing comment, who would not do
something because they want.
[MTTS] nadira: Yes, a forum about profiles and character concepts sounds like a
good idea, and that I would like to attend.
[MTTS] rosey: I do it in real life.
[MTTS] Carroll: That is stifling a person's spirit and creativity.
[MTTS] usfolks: My char has some likes and dislikes, personality traits, very
much opposite to who I ame. Because if I come here and I play myself, even at a
different age, gender, race, and period in time, that is not roleplaying.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Sometimes it's as simple as just explaining why the character
does something.  'My character plays music for people' doesn't tell us anything
about the character, just an action they take.  If you explain what motivates
them to take that action, it has a better chance of showing the thought process
of the character.  And I don't mean 'i want to entertain them', because that's
not the full picture either.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.
[MTTS] usfolks: Because of that, my char gets on my nerves at times. I can't
stand the person they are...because they are not me and I wouldn't be friends
with them. But that makes it better RP. Don't play who you are, play the
character you want to play, yes. But don't make them like to do something
because you like to do it. Then you're just being you in a space game and not
roleplaying at all.
[MTTS] alc_71: The best advice I can give you is learn separation. I was
terrible with it for awhile and have worked hard to become better. Separating
yourself from the character is key. The character concept will give you more
time to sort out the profile. I do wish that were available when I was trying to
write mine.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Carroll: I think what usfolks is trying to say there is that
there needs to be a disconnect between the player and the character.  If the
character is doing something just because that's what the player would do in
that situation, that's not roleplaying, that's the player being the player.  It
leads to the removal of the IC/OOC divide and creates OOC issues.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yes Squid, thanks. I'm doing too many things at once and not
explaining myself too well I guess.
[MTTS] Carroll: If that is the way I want to play, that is my choice, in fact
its good to play yourself in another world it stretches your thinking and
imagination.
[MTTS] rosey: But how can staff know if I am doing that or not, they do not know
me oocly.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Except it doesn't, at all.  If you're being you, then you're
not roleplaying.  You're responding to events as you, the player, would.  Which
WILL lead to OOC problems, because we see it on a regular basis.
[MTTS] rosey: For all they know, in real life I hate music.
[MTTS] Carroll: To me roleplay is like entering into a book and feeling chars
doing their actions even if you have a hint of yourself.
[MTTS] alc_71: For example, let's say you have had four characters. They all
behave very similarly, staff is going to figure out that you are playing
yourself easy enough.
[MTTS] rosey: The type of character I am trying to make is different from any
others I have had.
[MTTS] usfolks: A lot of times they can tell. And yes, they see how we react. I
reacted oocly to a decision my chari made mecause I have the same flaw as they
do. Somehow I managed not to avoid. There's no way we can be opposite our char,
but we can make enough things different and do our actions on behalf of them,
and not on behalf of ourselves. When you start doing that, you tend to get hurt,
frustrated, and worse.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Rosey: That's fine.  But liking or disliking music doesn't
actually have anything to do with the character concept or their personality.
[MTTS] Carroll: And the tropes are so stifling to me!
[MTTS] nadira: Well, lots of people, including myself, who have played on this
game for a longer time, can tell you exactly why being yourself only hurts you
in the end. What if the story your character ends up in is too confronting to
you, comes too close to reality? I have spent months feeling really bad because
things related to a previous character were too close to who I am, and it had
made me, the player, feel depressed. No one needs that.
[MTTS] usfolks: Tropes are there fore a reason. They're overused. If you can
find a way to use one in a creative way and explain yourself, you might get
lucky.
[MTTS] usfolks: Also apparently my typing skills are sucking today. Apologies.
[MTTS] rosey: This is why I think it would be fun to just play to roleplay and
not worry about points so I don't have to do the hard job of a profile.
[MTTS] rosey: But I would need credits to do that too.
[MTTS] alc_71: I try to find things for my character to like that I dislike or
vice versa. Like I will never create a character who is into aspects my real
line of work. Also, smaller things like you may love beer and your character be
strongly against drinking alcohol. It does help with the separation.
[MTTS] Squidmind: The profile is there to help you roleplay, it's not a method
to avoid it.  That's why you can play the game to get a feel for the game world
and setting before you have to submit one.  Unless there are OOC issues, of
course.
[MTTS] rosey: But it seems I can try my best and still fail.

with profiles. Not just on an understanding it based situation, but also because
there are language issues. I wonder if maybe there were a way for any of us who
might speak their language to assist them, that perhaps they would be able to
achieve a profile, rather than the frustration that we seem to see, and then
they give up.

not not letting the person truly let themselves go.
[MTTS] Carroll: Oosp times.
The starship transitions into another sector.
[MTTS] Squidmind: The biggest reason for not playing yourself is always the fact
that if you're playing a character that isn't you, there's a distance between
the actions taken and you.  So when other characters and the game world react
negatively to your actions, you don't feel OOCly terrible.  But if you're just
you, you're going to feel pretty bad in real life because they're not saying
'that character did something dumb', they're saying 'YOU did something dumb'.

[MTTS] Squidmind: It says that in the world of SC, the majority of people do not

are part of a religion that comprises of the various extant religions that over
the past 300 years converged into a singular overarching framework that became
known as His Chosen Path.
[MTTS] usfolks: It doesn't say that there is a lack of religion anywhere. But
they do try to discourage people from playing a religous character because
unless it's done right, it can end in proselytizing in the game, which we don't
want.

[MTTS] Squidmind: We actually did have a very religious player a few years ago
who created a very religious character who shared all their views - basically
playing the player.  This resulted in a situation where a character in a world
whose overarching religion was all about personal choices and not trying to
convert people... tried to convert people in-game and got very, very angry OOCly
when the game world did not support their efforts to turn the game their
particular religion.

[MTTS] Squidmind: Basically, this is a sci fi space opera game about spaceships
and aliens, it's not really the right place to have an in-depth discussion
(whether roleplayed or real life) about religion.  Hence our creation of 'His
Chosen Path', which basically boils down to 'in the end everyone wants to get
along and after 300 years they kinda do, at least religion-wise'.

[MTTS] valiant8086: My character is sort of like me actually, but he's probably
better than the real me in pretty much every way.

difficult to get my character to care about politics.

sometimes small jokes in headlines or whatnot zoom right over my head because of
where I'm from. I completely miss the US Politics humor if I'm not watching for

[MTTS] Butchulla: Oh, hell yes to babylon 5.
[MTTS] Carroll: Oo loved Babylon Five!
[MTTS] davetaylor: I still haven't watched that, since the last time we talked
about it on here.
[MTTS] atherj: Everyone says if I liked babylon 5 I'd like stargate, but been
way way too busy to ever even consider watching it.

The ship's current engine speed is 5333 km/s.
At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in

[MTTS] Squidmind: Books based on what, moose?

[MTTS] atherj: Far as I was told the books sucked.
[MTTS] Butchulla: You might actually. I know I didn't mind it when I took the
time to watch it. But super busy means I haven't had time to delve for a while
now.
[MTTS] alc_71: Both are great shows. Though I prefer next generation and voyager
for Star Trek.
[MTTS] moose: Babylon 5?
mir
[MTTS] Squidmind: Voyager is terrible.
[MTTS] Carroll: I also loved Knight Rider even though not space related, I love
imagination and no not combat or even peopel fighting against each other.
[MTTS] davetaylor: DS9 is probably my favourite trek.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Oh, there are probably hundreds.  Most sci fi franchises have
a ton of 'not at all canon' books.
[MTTS] atherj: Yeah.
[MTTS] Squidmind: DS9 was a great show, but terrible Trek.
[MTTS] moose: I think I'm going to start with the original trek. Even though
I've been told to start with next generation.
[MTTS] alc_71: Na, Enterprise was the terrible one.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Start with TOS, definitely, and yes, Enterprise was bad.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Start with the original. Then move on from there.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Enterprise started off badly but got progressively better
until it got cancelled just before it would've been amazing.  The 'grand finale'
was awful though.
[MTTS] Carroll: I also love on this game the crafting stuff to and SSN I love
that too!
[MTTS] atherj: And see, that's the problem with anyone who ever wanted to get
into star trek. There are so many damn stories that who the fuck knows where
they should start.
[MTTS] davetaylor: It had a couple of good episodes.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, sorry. I just can't get into enterprise. Even if it does
get better, I just can't get past the first couple eps.
[MTTS] alc_71: It was pretty bad. But so was the last season of Voyager.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Really you can just take each Star Trek series as its own
thing and ignore the others, really.  There might be one or two episodes that
have big call-backs to a previous show, but not enough to really alienate you.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Agreed, atherj. It's hard to suggest where someone should
start.
[MTTS] usfolks: At least it's not star wars. Don't kill me.
[MTTS] Carroll: I remember a few like when picard became a kid and could nto use
the space ship's computers.
Incoming hypercaster identification ping from Unknown Contact 914773072 at

[MTTS] Carroll: Er not.
[MTTS] moose: Hmm.
[MTTS] Carroll: Star Wars the little that I knwo of it is ok to.
[MTTS] alc_71: Don't knock Yoda.
[MTTS] nadira: Yeah, I fell into the middle of next generation and with jst 2 or
3 episodes I could pretty much work out what it generally was about.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Apart from DS9 and Enterprise, you can pretty much dip in and
out of trek.
[MTTS] usfolks: I can't get past the brother-sister kiss. SORRY!
[MTTS] Carroll: I would love to my char like one of those shows.
[MTTS] atherj: At least with star wars, as long as you know what order to watch
the movies in, they're all based on the same general storyline.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Yoda rocks.
[MTTS] atherj: Even episode 3.5.
[MTTS] usfolks: Even DS9 you can do that until the later seasons.
[MTTS] valiant8086 has left the channel.
[MTTS] Squidmind: I think it depends on what you want from a show.  If you like
cheesy optimistic space opera, TOS all the way.  If you like progressive
optimistic philosophy, TNG.  If you want a dark, vaguely religious, vaguely
shades of grey overarching plot, go DS9.  Voyager has like three good episodes,
so I can't really recommend it.   Enterprise is also hard to recommend, but I
love Shran.
[MTTS] rosey: I was away from keyboard doing stuff and got to thinking, one
reason I want to make my char the way I was trying to is there are things that
in real life because of my situation I can't do but would like to, in the game I
can though.
[MTTS] davetaylor: A bit less so, but yes, it's the story arcs that make it
harder, but they are awesome.
[MTTS] alc_71: I used to be scared of Darth Vader when I was young because of
that breathing he had going on.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Squid, well put.
[MTTS] moose: Okay this answers a lot for me.
[MTTS] rosey: For example in real life I would not be allowed to freely pay
music and entertain others but I would like to.
[MTTS] rosey: Play.
[MTTS] usfolks: Alc_71: I am your father. You kissed your sister!
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.
[MTTS] atherj: Only avid star wars fans know how much that phrase is actually
misquoted.
[MTTS] alc_71: It sure is.
[MTTS] usfolks: I know it's misquoted, but it was intentional.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Voyager is hard to recommend because it's internally
inconsistent with writing, characterisation, and the actual plotlines. 
Enterprise is hard to recommend because it starts terribly and takes a good
season or so to start improving, and I can't really say 'watch these awful 14
hours of rubbish and then the next ones will be a bit better'.
[MTTS] atherj: Which star trek series had the sexy half robot chick?
[MTTS] Butchulla: Maybe not, but you did recommend a seriously good set of books
though, so you're one up for that.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Voyager.
[MTTS] alc_71: Voyager.
[MTTS] atherj: That was voyager, right?
[MTTS] atherj: Oh.
[MTTS] usfolks: She was fully human with borg implants.
[MTTS] Squidmind: That was also like halfway through the seasons, too.
[MTTS] usfolks: As I have before, I will defend my Voyager. Har har har.
[MTTS] autumnrain has left the channel.
[MTTS] nadira: I think I have watched every star trek episode from TOS, TNG,
DS9, voyager and enterprise by now, and then a friend got me into the fan made
audio drama called starship excelsior which I love.
[MTTS] Squidmind: She's a cyborg, because she was Borg, so half robot is...
technically accurate, if not entirely useful.
[MTTS] Squidmind: What about TAS?!
[MTTS] Squidmind: Everyone always forgets TAS.
[MTTS] usfolks: TAS?
[MTTS] usfolks: Oh!
[MTTS] Squidmind: The Animated Series.
[MTTS] davetaylor: I said that exact thing just the other day.
[MTTS] usfolks: I've only seen a few. It's available on Netflix though. I love
the giant tribble in their version of TTWT.
[MTTS] Squidmind: It had a catgirl and a guy with three legs.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I liked TAS, but I know many many didn't.
[MTTS] Carroll: I used to love those super hero cartons.
[MTTS] nadira: I have heard of the animated series, never watched it though.
Should see if here it's also available on netflix.
[MTTS] usfolks: I haven't seen it since I was 7. I won't say how old I am!
[MTTS] alc_71: I've watched them all at some point or other. I love Sci-Fi.
[MTTS] Squidmind: I loved it for what it was.  Also it had the Kzinti in it,
which I vastly enjoyed.
[MTTS] usfolks: I read most of the books of TOS when I was growing up. They
probably kept me sane. Diane Duane was amazing with them.
[MTTS] valiant8086 has joined the channel.
[MTTS] rosey: Another thing I have tried to play a char different than me, In
real life I am very law abiding and I tried to play a criminal character once to
the extent that a host, even though the hosts are very picky on ic and ooc being
seperate, warned my char about losing his license when it could have be done and
should have been given IC.
[MTTS] usfolks: They did you a favor...
[MTTS] rosey: We get warnings for doing similiar things.
[MTTS] nadira: Well, they of course wanted you to be sure that was what you
wanted, as it would make your character rather unplayable.
[MTTS] Carroll: No they did not, they stifled her.
[MTTS] atherj: Always play a different char! My OOC me is a Catholic, for
instance. My IC scientifically-minded me though, absolutely chortles at the
concept of a God. Sometimes my conscience stabs at me when I do it, too like
"how can you say this, man!" It's kinda amusing at times.
[MTTS] rosey: The warning could have been just as well been given in character.
[MTTS] usfolks: How did they stifle her? They warned her that if they continued
on the same path, that's what would happen. But they didn't force her to stop.
[MTTS] davetaylor: You would have to bear in mind how criminality would be
viewed in that gameworld, and they would be helping you with that.
[MTTS] atherj: Carroll, they did not stifle her. They just wanted her to know
that in the IC world, there are consequences which could make her character
completely unplayable.
[MTTS] Squidmind: When events reach a point where unplayability becomes
possible, there is a sequence of events we try to go through to ensure a player
is aware of the direction their character is taking.  One of these is an OOC
aside to make sure they know what can happen.
[MTTS] usfolks: Not necessarily. In-character, they probably would have just
yanked the license. They did you a favor. Please see it as such.
[MTTS] atherj: She could've continued down her current roleplay path if she
chose.
[MTTS] atherj: And sufferred those consequences.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Carroll: It appears you already have a very unwavering opinion
of us.
[MTTS] Carroll: I also find that there's way to many tropes so that you cant' do
the profile like a good story and not some stilted short paragraph short on
details.
[MTTS] atherj: Yeha. Do you play Miriani or something?
[MTTS] moose has left the channel.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Atherj: That's unnecessary.
[MTTS] atherj: Sorry.
[MTTS] rosey: I love the games and activities on here and really want to play.
[MTTS] usfolks: The tropes are not something you absolutely cannot use. My
accepted profile had several. But you have to do them in a certain way.
[MTTS] Carroll: It just seems the help files to me are vague sorry I don't knwo
how else to put it.
[MTTS] Squidmind: As for OOC asides, keep in mind that we do our best to
separate 'Stop doing X' from 'If you keep doing X, Y will happen.'  The latter
means you are welcome to continue, but with the player knowledge that there will
be consequences.  Consequences are vital for good roleplay, both negative and
positive.
[MTTS] atherj: Anyway, if the hosts did not come to you and tell you that you're
in danger of losing your license, then there would be complaints instead from
the characters of "oh, you guys didn't tell me this could happen and why didn't
you tell me this could happen etc etc."
[MTTS] usfolks: And I've heard them before when people didn't get the aside they
thought they should. People are going to bitch, moan, and whine, no matter what
the hosts do.
[MTTS] usfolks: I think the two of you are making character separation and
creating a character separate from yourself more difficult than it needs to be.
[MTTS] Squidmind: It's a fine line to walk and we do make missteps, we're not
perfect.  But each time something happens we try to learn from it so that it
won't happen again in the future.  We'd rather give someone an unnecessary OOC
aside when they don't want it than NOT give them one when they would have
preferred it.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Remember, they are spending their free time, to keep this
game running, in the way it runs, which it has for many, many years, so they
know what works and what doesn't.
[MTTS] usfolks: Also, please remember they're HUMAN. With human flaws, human
faults, and they are capable of making human mistakes, as are we.
[MTTS] usfolks: And human feelings.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Yes, most of us are human.
[MTTS] nadira: Hmm, here's a strange comparison maybe. A guide dog is trained to
help a blind person walk from place 1 to place 2 more safely, and if the blind
person is gonna walk somewhere, where they might fall into a hole or something,
the dog will pull back, like hey, it's not safe to walk there. But it's up to
the blind person to trust the dog and try to figure out why the dog doesn't
wanna go there, or to walk ahead anyway and fall into the hole.
[MTTS] usfolks: Right. I forgot. Forgive me, Liege.
[MTTS] davetaylor: And I've seen plenty of blind people tell their dogs off for
doing exactly that.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Agreed on those points. Our hosts are human, and they give us
their free time. So of course mistakes are going to happen, things will happen.
I'd rather a host make a mistake than a host never make one if that makes any
sense at all.
[MTTS] usfolks: I asked my dog to walk me off a wall once. He did it. I didn't
get mad. Other than at me. I told him to do it. He didn't get mad at me either.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Keep in mind that if you want your character to do something
that will result in loss of licence or other form of unplayability, you can do
it.  It's just... it will result in unplayability.  We don't try to stop people
having their characters doing things that make sense for that character to do,
we just want it to make sense and for the player to understand that
unplayability means unplayability for that character.
[MTTS] Carroll: Sorry, what do you mean by unplayability by the character?
[MTTS] Squidmind: Although you should also keep in mind that the game world will
respond to things people do, and if you want things to really respond, we need
to know what the character is going to do before they do it. 
[MTTS] Squidmind: Where the character reaches a point where they are no longer
able to continue acting as a civilian pilot, usually with revocation of their
licence, or going unreg, or something else.  The point where the player no
longer controls that particular character.
[MTTS] rosey: So are you saying it would not be possible to play just for
roleplaying?
[MTTS] Squidmind: What do you mean by 'roleplaying'?  Everything I've just been
talking about is about roleplaying.
[MTTS] nadira: I think she means, roleplaying someone who is not a civilian
pilot.
[MTTS] rosey: Another thing, I love this game, want to play it badly enough that
I have considered going as far as asking for help with a profile in a way that
might sound theatening but that is how badly I want to be able to play to the
full extent.
[MTTS] Squidmind: We tried offering the ability for players to have a non-pilot
character at one point.  It took a lot of work for each one, and the players
involved didn't have much fun with it.  The game is very much focused on being a
civilian pilot.
[MTTS] usfolks: For my part, I'm very glad for one of those ooc asides. I looked
into doing something with my char once, that if I had gone through with it, my
char's license would have been immediately revoked, no questions asked, do not
pass go, do not collect 200 credits. However, I as the player did not realize
this. I knew there might be consequences, but not an actual immediate end. If
staff hadn't put it to me bluntly, that this would mean a certain and immediate
end, I wouldn't have known. There was no room for in-character warning.
[MTTS] rosey: Threatening.
[MTTS] rosey: By saying if I can get the help I need I would donate, do what I
can to encourage others to play and in other words support the game in all I
can, but if not I would do the opposite and try to make so others do not want to
play.
[MTTS] rosey: That is how badly I want to play.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Threatening to try and stop people from playing the game is
not going to help with your profile.  That sort of thing is very close to
violating policy.
[MTTS] rosey: I do not mean it in a threatening way just trying to say how badly
I want help and be able toplay.
[MTTS] Squidmind: We're willing to help with any specific questions you have,
but we cannot and will not write a profile for you.
[MTTS] Squidmind: You're making a threat and saying you don't mean it in a
threatening way?
[MTTS] usfolks: Rosey, best I can tell you is sit down and look critically at
what they send you as a response to what you've submitted. Take the time. When I
got my first rejection I read quickly through it and didn't really understand
it. So sit down, take time, and read and re-read what they tell you. Then do as
they say. Don't take some negative piece of it and overreact and throw
everything in the garbage.
[MTTS] nadira: Yeah, what you are saying makes no sense. Even if the profile
turned you from wanting to play here, why would you want to discourage others
from playing here?
[MTTS] valiant8086: I made it through the process, if I can do it anybody can do
it, and I didn't have any help beyond check this or that help file from people
on newbie and the comments I got back on my concept and my profile submissions.
[MTTS] usfolks: Hey, I've seen the criticism about this game elsewhere. It won't
be new. If you want to threaten that, I guarantee you it might just have the
opposite effect.
[MTTS] usfolks: Same, Valiant8086.
[MTTS] rosey: I see what you are saying but I do so badly want to write a
profile that can be approved but to be honest I want to wriet a profile that
gets approved but am not good with words.
[MTTS] usfolks: Take your time.
[MTTS] rosey: Excuse that but I got distracted while typing.
[MTTS] Carroll: And I can write a good novel but not one that can fit into a
mold that they want.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Agreed, I found a couple of issues, but they were talked
about and I had a profile done. What the hosts were telling me at the time was
spot on, and the chat we had made changes happen that should help everybody.
[MTTS] Squidmind: You don't need to be a fantastic author or anything, we just
want to be able to understand the character of the person you plan to play.
[MTTS] Squidmind: That's the whole point of the profile.
[MTTS] nadira: Oh yeah, I have sat on another game where, on the ooc channel
players were bashing games, including Star Conquest. And someone once asked me
why I still play, and I told them, because I like the game. Simple.
[MTTS] valiant8086: Then write one and listen to what they say, when they make
comments and don't accept it, maybe you could even ask on newbie or something
here if anybody can explain what the comments you got mean?
[MTTS] usfolks: It's not a mold they're looking for, Carroll. They're just
asking you avoid a few things that are overused to an extreme.
[MTTS] rosey: To the extent that I wonder what is left to be allowed.
[MTTS] Squidmind: The 'mold' we want is 'civilian pilot in the world of Star
Conquest'.  If you want to play a Star Trek captain, or a Jedi, or a half-human
hybrid, this isn't the game for you.
[MTTS] usfolks: Tons of stuff.
[MTTS] valiant8086: The issue where I couldn't play as a cadet at all was pretty
much limited to me right?
[MTTS] rosey: That is where I need help.
[MTTS] usfolks: Look how many distinct characters with approved profiles there
already are. You can't tell me we're all the same.
[MTTS] valiant8086: Because I'm suddenly wondering if somebody's pissed off
cause they're stuck and can't get out and play at all because they don't have a
character concept.
[MTTS] rosey: My first character had the first profile approved and now I can't
do it.
[MTTS] usfolks: Can't never could.
[MTTS] Squidmind: valiant8086: Not solely to you, but it's only meant to be set
up when someone is a troublemaker or sets off something suspicious. 
Unfortunately, you got tagged because of your timing when you created.
[MTTS] usfolks: Rosey, I'm wondering if that might be the first and main
problem. You THINK you CAN'T. But the truth is, you're afraid to try.
[MTTS] Carroll: And the hosts even loved two of my fave chars but due to ooc
reasons I got rid of them and yes I was and still sad and yes I miss them very
much.
[MTTS] rosey: I have tried and failed.
[MTTS] davetaylor: This is my first major RP, as I'm sure a lot of people can
guess, and I got a profile done, and after tonight, I know what I'd do for a
concept if I now had to, so anyone can.
[MTTS] usfolks: Just because you have failed in the past, doesn't mean you won't
succeed in the future. Flip a switch. Adjust the attitude, and try again.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Failure is the first step to success!
[MTTS] usfolks: Exactly.
[MTTS] Squidmind: And the second.  Often also the hundredth.
[MTTS] Carroll: If I oculd I would have one of my fave cars back, but alas!
[MTTS] valiant8086: Heh, well I'm glad I kept trying to get out and complaining
about it. I'd sure have been missing out if I'd just quit and gave it up.
[MTTS] Butchulla: And remember, support tickets exist for a reason. The glorious
squidmind has already said here today that the hosts are more than willing to
assist you with your profile.
[MTTS] usfolks: Rosey, there's something I'm working on that's getting tons and
tons of rejection. But guess what? I keep trying. I know I can get it right. And
there's the difference. KNow that there are those who want to help. Staff
included. And a mentor. And maybe try something new. Maybe a new alliance or a
new aspect...but change something up and maybe you'll be able to get where you
want to be.
[MTTS] alc_71: Staff is very helpful if you give them a chance. They've given me
many tips for RP and things over the years.
[MTTS] valiant8086: And keep what you already wrote in a word processor so you
can keep working from that and not starting over from scratch.
[MTTS] usfolks: Absolutely.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Half my problem is that I appreciate that the hosts give up
their spare time for us, so I hate bugging them with supports. I mean of course
I do it, but there's the part of me that feels bad for taking up their time.
[MTTS] nadira: Yeah, I wrote the profile in a notepad and so I still have the
profiles for my previous characters. And whenever I am in doubt as how to play
my current character, I do read the approved profile.
[MTTS] usfolks: For those that play tabletop, and Rosey and Carroll, not sure if
you two do, but imagine sitting down to a tabletop game with no character
profile set out. How do you make decisions for your character? How do you
roleplay? You don't. That concept and profile is a necessity for roleplay, and
I'm so glad that it's such a focus here.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Same Butchulla, I try to figure things out on my own, but I
know when I have something big, I will need to support.
[MTTS] Carroll: I have seen people play tabletop and they play as they go.
[MTTS] usfolks: I have never heard of a tabletop game where you don't at least
make a character sheet to start out with.
[MTTS] valiant8086: Me neither.
[MTTS] usfolks: You have to know what your char's strengths and weaknesses are,
their race, their skills, etc.
[MTTS] Carroll: But isnt' that sheet just the stats?
[MTTS] rosey: In real life too, our whole life is not planned out, we live life
according to waht comes up or what happens.
[MTTS] nadira: I have never played a table top. But I can not imagine ever
playing one without at least some idea of who I am playing.
[MTTS] Butchulla: In tabletop without a char sheet you may as well forget it. I
completely see the point usfolks is making here.
[MTTS] usfolks: The profile is like your stats. Think of it that way. Without
it, how do you even play?
[MTTS] Squidmind: There are two ways to create a character - the first is you
start with the concept and play it, the second is you start playing and then
craft the concept in that early period.  Both are valid here, because you can
enter the game as a cadet, whose IC existence is in a state of flux until the
profile is approved.
[MTTS] usfolks: This is not real life, Rosey. This is roleplay.
[MTTS] Carroll: I play in games as I go, like for instance a char could be
sitting in the lounge or on a ship wit ithers either on a trip or fighting, then
when life happens I act according.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Rosey: In real life, your character is created as you grow up
to reach the 'now'.  In-game, you're starting at the 'now', and we have to work
backwards to find out about that character.
[MTTS] Carroll: To me roleplay is imagine as I go.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Those stats in the table top games help you decide what
actions to take, are you going to hit something, cast a spell on it, run away,
what are you going to do?
[MTTS] usfolks: That's something else entirely, Carroll.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Now I kinda wish we had to make will and fort saves and
whatnot, to figure out what our character would be.
[MTTS] Squidmind: 'Imagine as I go' sounds like you just decide semi-randomly
how to act in any given moment.  That isn't a consistent character, or at least
not a character that would ever have been approved a licence.  Hence the issue
there.
[MTTS] alc_71: Yes, there is playing as you go. But too, you need some
background. Like, I am a good fighter because, why? Or I am a terrible fighter
because I, why?
[MTTS] Carroll: Hey its better than me living at home doing nothing, think of my
char in a future space world and boom, for me that is rp.
[MTTS] usfolks: It was very helpful for me to play the game for awhile before
starting to write a profile. We didn't have concepts back then. (you lucky
whippersnappers). But getting a feel for the game world helps you develop a
history. How you got here. Why you're here, how you're going to react now that
you are.
[MTTS] nadira: Yeah, what squidmind says, the choices you would make today are
defined by upbringing, personality, all sorts.
[MTTS] davetaylor: And a whole 250 points of all types before you get capped,
you lucky things.
[MTTS] usfolks: Carroll, that is not RP.
[MTTS] Carroll: For me a concept is hard as I can't put my personality and so on
in one sentence.
[MTTS] usfolks: That is you being you in a different setting.
[MTTS] Squidmind: And that's a perfectly valid form of roleplay in some places. 
Just not here.  Different places will expect different things from roleplay.  If
you want a consistent game world, you need consistent characters to inhabit that
world.
[MTTS] valiant8086: Your personality is not wanted in the concept, not really as
far as I understand.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Yeah. That's amazing that points thing. We had 25 in each
category. So you guys are lucky. You have way more time to feel out the game.
[MTTS] Squidmind: The concept is a single summation of the character.  If you
had to describe someone in a single sentence, how would you do it?  How would
you describe Elon Musk?  Adolf Hitler?  Superman?  David Bowie?
[MTTS] Squidmind: Adolf Hitler loved dogs, played with kids, was an artist.  But
does that tell us anything about his personality?  No.
[MTTS] usfolks: Here's the thing. You can use this as an escape, sure. But Rosey
is playing Rosey in the future, that is not roleplaying. If Carroll is playing
Carroll in the future, that is not roleplaying. That is being you in a different
setting. In order to be able to decide how your char will react on a consistent
basis, you have to have something set out that will determine that. My char does
things that drive me up the wall. Because my char has a background very
different to mine. But if I just went with my imagination and played how I
would...I wouldn't be roleplaying at all.
[MTTS] Carroll: David would be a good musician adolph woudl be a bad man to
whilled just because he thought the race of people who was inferior.
[MTTS] usfolks: That doesn't tell you who they are.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Neither of those define either of those people.
[MTTS] Carroll: Hmm, I am stuck now.
[MTTS] Squidmind: 'musician' and 'bad man' can apply to millions of people.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Key things about these people are things like how they go
about getting what they want done, and what effect that has on people.
[MTTS] Carroll: Adolph was a ruthless tyrant who killed because he thougth a
race was inferior. Ok maybe I am missing something, so hwo would I define David
or Adolph then?
[MTTS] valiant8086: Maybe I'm missing somebody's point but that actually sounded
a little close to to what is wanted in the concept.
[MTTS] Carroll: Hmm, maybe I am nto good a short blurbs but a person who is
either outgoing or greedy is easier to describe.
[MTTS] valiant8086: You saw the help files about this right?
[MTTS] Carroll: So would a concept e a person who likes to explore, is outgoing
but can be quiet when the situation is uncomfortable or warranted.
[MTTS] Carroll: Yes I saw the profile but I can't seemt o fit mine in.
[MTTS] Squidmind: One example for Hitler might be 'A charismatic bigot who wants
to restore his nation's glory by vilifying those different to him.'  You have
aspects of 'bad man' there, but there's enough to separate him from everyone
else who does bad things.  You see a tiny aspect of the drive he has.  For
Bowie, maybe 'A confused man who spent his life trying to find himself through
the art he created.'
[MTTS] Squidmind: Yeah, Carroll's second example was a lot closer.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Basically, what defines the character as a person?  What is
the core of them?
[MTTS] Squidmind: We're not asking for a fully fleshed out three dimensional
entire life of a person, that would be ridiculous. But we want something that
makes it appear as if that life could exist.
[MTTS] rosey: In real life I am limited in what I can do and am allowed to do
from others and from consequences and so some of that stuff I would like to do
in the game, I like to play with the pupppets and music instruments here.
[MTTS] usfolks: When that character concept came out, I sat down and wrote one
for my char. And then I went, ok, how would I have changed his profile based on
this? I think I would have been able to write that profile a lot better the
first time if I'd had that concept of who I (always) wanted him to be if I'd
started with the concept first. And like Dave, I've gone back and looked at my
profile. And that profile has allowed me to have some amazing RP opportunities,
thanks to hosts. They helped me with events (based off the profile) that have
made the char so much more real.
[MTTS] Squidmind: I am sorry to hear that there are things you are limited in
doing and disallowed from doing in real life, rosey.  However, this game is not
really focused on playing musical instruments and playing with puppets, nor are
either of those a character concept.
[MTTS] rosey: In feedback on my profiles I have also been told that flying ships
and doint pilot stuff is not all there is either so how do I kow how I can put
in a profile.
[MTTS] rosey: Know.
[MTTS] valiant8086: Play as a cadet for a while and find out?
[MTTS] usfolks: It's a combination. Life isn't just your job. Your personality
isn't your job.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Stuff about what you're like in groups, how you deal with
conflict, are you ambitious, laid back, argumentative, do you keep quiet or
speak without thinking, so many things you can talk about.
[MTTS] rosey: I have done that and kknow the game quite well.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Flying ships and 'doing pilot stuff' is basically the job of
the character.  It doesn't add anything to the profile because you're describing
game mechanics, not a personality.  If you mean that you say in the profile that
your character wants to fly ships and 'do pilot stuff', that also doesn't add to
the -character-, because the character is the why, not the what.

[MTTS] rosey: How about this as a concept? Dorothy is a girl who is tired of the
mundane life she is used to and whishes to spread her wings?
[MTTS] Squidmind: It's better than talking about starships or playing the piano,
but it still suffers from the same basic issue. It doesn't describe who Dorothy
is or separate her from all the other people who are tired of their mundane
lives and want to spread their wings.  What makes her any different to them?
[MTTS] rosey: Hmm let me use my imagination.
[MTTS] Squidmind: But you're definitely on the right track.
[MTTS] rosey: Thanks.
[MTTS] Carroll: Carroll is a confused girl trying to find herself and in time
learns to somehow free herself and find knowledge, adventure and personal
growth.
[MTTS] Carroll: Since there are so many tropes what am I allowed to do?
[MTTS] Squidmind: That one isn't so good.  You've copied the first half of the
Bowie concept but haven't actually got the meaningful part, you just have a bit
where you talk about a vague future.
[MTTS] Squidmind: You still haven't explained what you mean by tropes and
'allowed to do'.
[MTTS] Carroll: I mean the many tropes that are mentioned in the help file, I
mean I cannot be an explorer, or comr from a poor background or from a farming
background, etc etc.
[MTTS] usfolks: Carroll, tropes are just that because they're overused and
overused. Everyone wants to have a tragic past where they were left alone at a
young age on a farm because the Outsiders killed their parents (who happened to
be famous). If you can find a way to make a trope not tropish...then try it.
Tropes are not an absolute no. You just have to find a way to make them not so
common.
[MTTS] Squidmind: None of those things should define a person.  They are
forbidden tropes because people tried to use them as a replacement for actually
putting in a character.
[MTTS] Carroll: Sinc ehtere are so many, hwo would I flesh even the vauge
concepts I had just put out nhere?
[MTTS] Carroll: Er mistyping.
[MTTS] Carroll: I meant since there are so many, hwo can I flesh out the vague
concepts and even make a good profile.
[MTTS] Squidmind: There are nineteen examples in the forbidden tropes help file.
 Do you really think there are only nineteen possible character archetypes or
personalities in the world?  Most of those forbidden tropes don't actually have
anything to do with the character at all, but events in-game or family history.
[MTTS] usfolks: As an example, there is a country bumpkin whose dead relative
was a pilot and has a politician parent. However, while they are tropes, they
were done in a way that didn't follow exactly as others had used them. So they
made it through. Be creative. Don't use what everyone else has.
[MTTS] usfolks: These things also do not define said character. They are but a
tiny bit of the history.
[MTTS] usfolks: Ok, maybe the country bumpkin does...
[MTTS] Squidmind: If your profile is 'I lived on a farm, my parents were farmers
and did farmer things, I did farmer things, then I became a pilot.'  How does
that tell us anything about that character?  They know how to plough a field? 
That's a skill, not part of their personality.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Why become a pilot given how people feel about pilots?
[MTTS] rosey: I thought you did not want personality in concept.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Rosey: Carroll specifically mentioned the profile, so I
responded to that.
[MTTS] usfolks: The tropes shouldn't play a part in concept at all, even if you
find a way to make them work.
[MTTS] rosey: Oh.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Basically, the why is always more important than the what. 
The what can give context, but without the why is entirely useless.
[MTTS] rosey: Even in real life I would have problems explaining why I do what I
do.
[MTTS] rosey: Sometimes.
[MTTS] usfolks: We all do sometimes. But can you explain why you are (in
general) the way you are? Not individual actions, but your general persona?
[MTTS] rosey: Not really.
[MTTS] rosey: Maybe to a certain extent.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Rapid Recharging Eatery &
Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean
cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

ftl 275
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 275."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this
area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the
distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

[MTTS] atherj: So hosts, since we have temp station modules for just about
everything, have you guys thought of adding a QE one, out of curiosity?

quite prohibitive.

ship-installed one, it would be what, 200 megacredits?
[MTTS] Ulias: A set of asteroid mining ones might be kinda neat too, though I'm
not sure how much it would actually get used. But it could be a set of them like

[MTTS] Ulias: A QE one would be pretty nice though for sure.
[MTTS] atherj: I would probably say something more along the lines of 24-25
megacredits.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I don't even wanna think about a module that would cost 200
megacredits.
[MTTS] atherj: For something like what is currently occurring with the
in-character expedition that people are on now, a QE module would've been an
interesting add-on.
[MTTS] usfolks: However, those chars do have easy access to a QE as it is.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Yeah, it would have.

[MTTS] atherj: Not necessarily, at least when they see people with the percent
signs, at least they're seeing that there are actually people on the game, even
if they're not actually somewhere where they can talk. If there's just a line
saying there are people out of communications range, or active but with comms
off and only shows like 5 names total, then that will spark a whole new line of
things.
[MTTS] usfolks: Thanks Grunze. Basically what I was trying to get at in a
slightly different way earlier.
[MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, if youa re a new player you might not know what that line
means about folks being out of comms at first.
[MTTS] usfolks: They see that with the line there though. " Your communicator
also reports that there are 11 pilots who were active but dropped out of
communications."

[MTTS] atherj: And as a completely new player, who wouldn't have friends to ask
questions to OOCl on Roleplaying Eradication Software or their preferred form of
messengery, do you relaly think a lot of them would know what that would mean if
they were completely fresh to the mud?
[MTTS] usfolks: I didn't have anyone to ask oocly. I asked on Newbie I believe
and it was explained to me.

[MTTS] Butchulla: I think seeing the names did make it easier for me when I
started out. At least seeing people there even though they can't rp with you, is
better than just seeing a whole chunk of people out of range.
[MTTS] nadira: I certainly would not have known what out of comms range was
during the first days of my gameplay. I do think that function on the qe exists
to make the game seem less empty of players, but only the hosts can give us a
definite answer on that.
[MTTS] atherj: Pretty much, yeah. At least you won't see a who list with only
like 4 names on it.
[MTTS] Ulias: I do like that there's times when you are just gone from the list,
I wouldn't want that to be completely removed.
[MTTS] atherj: You can turn off your communicator for that! Even on a
QE-equipped ship.
[MTTS] atherj: (I think that works on a QE-equipped ship) not sure.
[MTTS] Ulias: It does.
[MTTS] usfolks: Actually, if you turn your comm off on a QE-equipped ship, you
still show up on the who list back home, just not to the poeple on the ship.
[MTTS] Ulias: Oh really? Hmm, learn somethign new all the time.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah. I tested it out recently. I was surprised too.
[MTTS] atherj: That sounds potentially buggy and worth a support ticket.
[MTTS] nadira: If you only see yourself on the game, which does happen at times,
th efact that it somewhere says there might be 10 other players somewhere, might
not really make you realize you could ask them over the newbie channel.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Agreed, Ulias. But in general, I like seeing the names. I
think from an OOCly perspective, it's good for people to see names, rather than
just a bunch of inactive people. It makes you want to stick around and play,
rather than just logging off because you're the only one around.
[MTTS] usfolks: I've been home with no one out of comms, myself dozing, only one
new player around, and saw them ask something. I came out of dozing to answer.
So that's not exactly accurate.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 275."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
[0m[Miriani] Kitty Mars says to you, "you know I would have so loved that because I

The starship has left a unique area of space.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Rapid Recharging Eatery &

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this
area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the
distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
