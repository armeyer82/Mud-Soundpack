-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

03:00 [Starship "Blueberry"; Control Room]
A floor lamp is casting a bright halo of light here.  The scent of strawberry suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the rose-tinted windows partially obscured by sheer gold curtains, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an AutoVector navigation unit, an oriental rug, a lavender tapestry sectional sofa, a glass coffee table, a small trash can, a Galactic map unit, a sector debris scanner, a starship simulator, a Galactic anomaly recording unit, a Galactic navigation unit, a silver espresso machine, a planetary system surveying unit, a temporary structure launcher, a bottle of fine white wine, a large beanbag chair, a floor lamp, Higgins the droid, Daizey the droid, an advanced FTL drive tracer, an internal stun turret, and a plastic cooler here.

03:05 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved top of lightweight deep amethyst purple cotton with delicately painted gold flowers at the wrists and hem and a pair of skinny white low rise jeans. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronomete

05:27 Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo kitten seems to be hungry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

15:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

15:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

19:19 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see Meow the little calico CatBot, a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, KitCat the humanoid service robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a black plastic tray of spider chow, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

22:13 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

22:13 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Lily Kaise.

22:13 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

22:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:13 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Happy, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:13 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

22:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:13 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:13 Lily Kaise stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

22:13 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a market application and peers at the screen.

22:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:13 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 284" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

22:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:13 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:13 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:13 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:13 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Happy! Welcome to home space!"

22:13 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

22:13 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

22:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:14 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Happy. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:14 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

22:14 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:14 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

22:14 Lily Kaise glides out.
Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters after Lily Kaise.

22:14 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:15 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
