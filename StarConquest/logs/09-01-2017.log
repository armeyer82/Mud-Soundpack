00:24:35 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:24:36 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

00:27:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You can ask people. I can craft a stun batton and other stun weapons as long as I can get the supplies."

00:27:49 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

00:27:53 I don't see "lily onl ips" here.

00:52:37 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Anything else before I leave the Bubble?"

00:52:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:52:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There is one pilot that I would love to stun for the rest of his wretched life!

00:54:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow."

00:55:08 You say, "Eve was like, why would I need to steal felo when I have plenty of my own."

00:55:55 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anyone know if there's a way to send mail directly to the desk of a Voice? Or does it always need to come through their personal mail."

00:56:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well if she was taking felo without permission, that's not good but if I'm gone and someone is taking care of mine, I don't care if they take some and I told her in my return letter that as long as she left a few soldiers where there are soldiers and a few Sabre-Tooth where there are Sabre-Tooth so that they could propagate again, I didn't mind."

00:56:17 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It has to go through their personal mail."

00:57:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It'd have to go through more hands that way. More direct to send it through the regular mail system."

00:57:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's kinda what I was thinking Jacob. Seperate it into something more official."

00:57:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But this works, just making sure."

00:58:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:58:21 You say, "Oh, he was just responding to Eli's question about whether it is possible to send mail to the desk of the Voice."

00:58:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'oh."

00:58:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I really don't know of a way. I wish there was though."

00:59:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have just sent it directly to the person and just indicated what it was for."

00:59:11 You say, "Yeah, there isn't. Me too, but of course, Morris has an answer for everything."

00:59:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shrugs.

00:59:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup."

00:59:26 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

00:59:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

00:59:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is why I don't stay tuned to the Morris or more ass channel any more than I have to."

00:59:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:59:57 You laugh.

01:00:16 You say, "Yeah, Constantine and I were talking about him over the org channel."

01:00:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh I missed that but heh."

01:00:38 You chuckle.

01:00:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Too bad."

01:01:13 You say, "I honestly don't think that Eve stole any felo without permission."

01:02:44 You say, "But of course, Morris had to call her out over General. And creeate more drama. So I said over the org channel something about how the Morris drama continues and to tune in tomorrow for the next episode."

01:03:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:04:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

01:13:43 You laugh.

01:20:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh the BAS is back up and yup Starseekers were left off."

01:54:48 You grin.

01:54:49 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:54:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:54:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:54:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

League shuttle "Jammer" departed to EAOS sector Torus Corridor (Alpha-1) approximately 1 minute ago.

01:55:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:55:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I probably can with you here but unless I have your permission to do so, I won't."

01:55:30 You say, "You can launch to talk to merchant ships, I don't mind."

03:30:30 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:30:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a robotic chef named Nellie, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an insulated purple sleeping bag, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, a pair of mystic purple suede clogs, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

06:58:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn, four and a half hours to 287."

06:58:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think I've ever seen rift conditions this bad."

06:59:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would turn around but I have to move my ship."

06:59:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm.. you sure you left from the right spot? That sounds like there's no aceleration."

07:00:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I paid the toll and everything."

07:00:24 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "12 rats in orion, just so people are aware."

07:00:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The flow is exactly in the direction I'm going and at 9721 l-m/s though."

07:00:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is pretty fast."

07:00:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So that's probably why."

07:00:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Weird, I wonder if they forgot to put the accelerator on or something. You might have just paid the toll for the inserter alone."

07:01:11 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Star Of Gutenberg". The organization has earned 1,668,293.86 credits.

07:01:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, but even with that, if you were accelerated it shouldn't take that long. 285 is not really all that far if I remember right."

07:01:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I guess that's possible. The toll said it was for an accelerator."

07:01:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If that matters."

07:01:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh it did? Hmm."

07:02:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe they did mess it up. I've noticed using the inserter from the other side doesn't get me back to 286."

07:02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It puts me in random sectors."

07:02:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I came out in Olivia's Pearl yesterday."

07:02:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That sounds disconcerting."

07:02:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, that's just because of how close all the beacons are together."

07:02:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

07:03:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That happens with rift travel sometimes."

07:03:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So you get blown off course."

07:03:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Even when using an inserter?"

07:03:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not really that, it's just the way it pulls you out. Sometimes a different beacon than the one you are aiming for is the one that pulls you out."

07:03:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Wow, 5 hours now."

07:04:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm moving at a paltry 544 l-min/s."

07:04:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But I'm wondering, if someone didn't set the heading for the accelerator, if it would still charge you."

07:04:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I guess that's possible."

07:05:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I couldn't take it. I'll just try in a few hours."

07:08:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there a map?"

07:08:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like of space."

07:08:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking I don't know where any of our planets are in relation to one another."

07:08:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I thougth I might start mapping it myself using the providence ndb locator."

07:08:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, not really. You can use starcharts, but it takes some training to read them properly. Space is always changing and shifting so it's hard to always have a accurate map."

07:09:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh I see what you mean."

07:09:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I guess it makes sense that the relative positions of the planets would change."

07:09:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "On long timescales, though, I would think."

07:10:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah it's on long time scales. It's doable to figure out where they are in relation to each other. The easiest way is probably with a friend and a long-ranged scanner but that's kind of not much of an option at the moment."

07:10:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

07:12:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, the accelerators are lined up, it was just bad weather."

07:13:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's crazy."

07:17:58 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

07:18:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cackles!

07:18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

07:18:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That is sad. Beautiful, but sad."

07:19:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well at least we're succeeding at what we set out to do."

07:19:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, absolutely."

07:19:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It just happens to be very little."

07:20:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It just feels wrong though. To be pleased to see results like that. Normally that would make me jump up and work my butt off."

07:20:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone chuckles.

07:20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Who knows, maybe in three, four months."

07:20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We'll be back to work!"

07:20:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli chokes as he transmits, "Three or four?"

07:21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Stars, I hope it doesn't take that long."

07:21:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You're right. It's gotta be at least eight."

07:21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

07:21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well with the negotiations on hold..."

07:23:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I still can't believe they only put them on hold. Anything that Danikin set up should be purged. If they are goign to continue to insist on outccord,  the least they can do is not use some shady escapist's deal."

07:23:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed."

07:23:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder what they're even negotiating about."

07:25:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It seems as though they still want access to the facilities and things like that, without contributing and without having to abide by restrictions. Though I'm not privvy on the specifics."

07:25:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, so they say. I can't imagine what reason the Accord would have to allow access to anything if we left."

07:25:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was pretty surprised that the Union basically insisted on not having access to Geminis, it's very odd."

07:26:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The Union insisted?"

07:27:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, that's not exactly what the headline said, no. It said that we may lose access to the Gemini due to Union insistance on limiting interaction."

07:27:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

07:27:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

07:27:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So I guess, in a way, they did insist on it?"

07:27:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, in a sense."

07:28:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, we can't fly geminis to GMG anymore, anyway."

07:28:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess we might get attacked by turtle thralls at any time."

07:28:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So they're still good to have."

07:30:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:30:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Does rifting consume power the way jumping does?"

07:30:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It doesn't seem to."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

10:20:24 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

10:20:27 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

10:20:30 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

10:20:31 There appear to be 4 pilots recently active.

10:20:34 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

10:20:38 You glance at your communicator's screen.

10:20:38 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, 10 days into the term, we have completed 0 of 47 beacon drops, 0 of 4 nests, and 0 of 0 salvage ops. Keep up the good work! [05:17  1 September 2317 GST]

You can go out and enter into the ship.

10:24:00 You exit the ship.

10:24:01 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

10:24:04 [The Torus; Garage]

10:24:04 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

10:24:08 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

10:24:09 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

10:24:23 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

10:24:26 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

10:24:26 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

10:24:28 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

10:24:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

10:24:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:24:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

10:24:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

10:24:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:24:57 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

10:25:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:25:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:25:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:25:03 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:25:04 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

10:25:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:25:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:25:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:25:08 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

10:25:11 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

14:16:46 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

14:16:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

14:16:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

14:17:06 You say to Lily, "Hey beautiful."

14:17:12 Lily says to you, "Good Handsome!"

14:17:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Good day too!"

14:17:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

14:18:41 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

14:18:42 You grin.

14:18:49 Not much to see out there.

14:18:55 You say, "I'm going to go check the office."

14:18:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:18:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:18:59 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:19:00 You're already sitting.

14:19:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

14:19:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:19:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:19:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:19:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:19:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

14:19:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:19:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:19:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:19:22 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:19:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

14:19:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:19:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:19:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:19:27 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

14:19:29 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

14:19:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:20:20 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:20:20 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:20:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:20:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:20:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:20:40 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

14:21:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

14:24:38 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:24:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:24:47 You scramble to your feet.

14:24:48 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

14:24:49 You exit the ship.

14:24:49 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

22:32:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

22:33:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

22:33:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:33:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey everybody."

22:34:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Heard anything yet, Eli?"

22:34:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Hiya."

22:34:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "No."

22:34:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And hello."

22:34:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Heya there! Tara, I still owe you that 2 mill."

22:34:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I may ask the office if the government would accept our input on van Dannikin's replacement."

22:35:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I figure the worst they can do is just say no."

22:35:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "No rush on it, Jacob. Can pass it along next time we meet."

22:35:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Hey, it's worth a shot."

22:35:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I suppose it can't hurt."

22:36:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:36:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I agree Constantine we need to keep showing our presence and above all speaking up for ourselves."

22:36:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Eighty three sectors traveled.. 3 artifacts found."

22:36:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And awesome! I'd just like to have the money in your hand ASAP. I'm back up to 9 mill after doing some missions. Had to get a battlesuit and all that stuff, so yeah. Also finally paid off that loan. Yay! Now to wait for my license."

22:37:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:37:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Good luck on that paperwork Jacob. I know it can seem to be a bit tedious."

22:37:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Also we aren't doing too well in terms of meeting our conquest goals."

22:37:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And thanks, lily. It sucks, I can say that much."

22:37:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, the bulk of the corps is currently on strike."

22:38:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "However, even before the strike, conquests during which we met both goals were rare."

22:38:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:38:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That is because we're on strike for the most part. Newer pilots aren't necessarily participating. During better times, we do well."

22:38:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh shit. That I didn't know."

22:38:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:38:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No no don't worry about that."

22:38:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just wait until the strike is over, conquest is gonna blow up."

22:38:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

22:39:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:39:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It sure will heh! If I feel like working again! I've enjoyed being very relaxed and enjoying more out of life!"

22:39:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Any reason as to why we're on strike in the first place? I don't have all the details, and I like details. Details are good."

22:39:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was talking to Eli and I've been wondering if maybe we're approaching this from the wrong angle."

22:39:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "How so?"

22:39:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if maybe we should have tried to approach of trying to influence the negotiations."

22:39:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like if we could actually get them to come to a deal, maybe this whole mess could be avoided."

22:40:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I've asked if they'll take our input on the negotiatior, and we'll see."

22:40:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:40:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I am not sure I think we still need to show major opposition. I don't think being diplomatic will be heard very well."

22:40:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And I've not really given myself time to relax. I hate being lazy, to be honest, even though it's good sometimes. I'd rather bust my ass and try to make money to put towards stuff that the alliance needs as a whole rather than do nothing at all and give no help to anyone."

22:40:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Cause like one problem is that van Dannikin likely wasn't at all invested in reaching an actual agreement."

22:40:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know what you mean, Lily, but I'm starting to worry that we have no actual bargaining power."

22:41:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like what is striking even doing?"

22:41:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hopefully making a difference, but who knows."

22:41:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "As of right now I'm sure it looks to them that no matter what we say, stuff will still get done."

22:41:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Our current president is attempting to withdraw us from the Accord of Free Worlds, a coalition of the three alliances that defends humanity. We tried official routes to voice our concerns about this and were ignored and eventually attacked as we tried more and more to talk about the negatives to leaving the Accord."

22:41:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is unavoidable, but we need to work around that, I think."

22:41:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:41:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well speak with Eli and get his perspective."

22:42:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So why does best want to withdraw us in the first place?"

22:42:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I talked to him about it. I'll start by asking if they'll take our input. I expect the answer will just be no, and none of this will matter."

22:42:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But we'll see."

22:42:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Which just eventually lead us here, the Accord negotiations are on hold for the moment due to a scandal, but it was stopped just days away from completion,  so we may still not have much time."

22:42:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:42:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Because he is a separatist."

22:42:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh dear god."

22:43:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The official reason is that it will be good for the Union. That's about as far as the explanation goes publiclly."

22:43:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The real enchilada would be to convince them to send a coalition to lead. Maybe Rebane, Culwyn, and someone from the NaPas."

22:43:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This way a scandal perpetrated by one guy like van Dannikin wouldn't bring the whole thing to a halt."

22:43:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But any discussion on the matter is being completely shut out by those in power. They won't even address concerns about it."

22:43:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Good for the union for us to leave the acord? Yeah, okay. Sure. I'll believe that when rats start buying us beers in the local bar."

22:43:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And the whole government would feel involved."

22:44:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

22:44:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "They want to do this when theres still threats like the IFS, rats, bari, and outsiders too."

22:45:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've heard a few things that would imply that it would be good for the Union on a very short term, then get quite bad for all alliances, icluding the Union."

22:45:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, ideally everyone should be worried it will go well in the short term."

22:45:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Really, it's my opinion that we need the accord, and they need us. Same with the other alliances. We're more interconnected than we realize, I think. Even if we don't particularly like each other, we still help each other out. So us leaving wouldn't really be doing anyone a favor."

22:45:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The last think we need as a species is for the Union to start doing well, and have all the other alliances start to want to abandon the Accord."

22:45:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Thing, I mean."

22:46:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cheers for Jacob Shields!

22:46:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:46:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Other alliances aren't going to get involved in our issues. The league would probably rather see the aEU go under."

22:46:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I mean, lets not forget one of our military's flotilla got dangerouls close to mutality space on 'accident', if I remember the headline right."

22:46:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "That can mean a ton of different things."

22:46:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh man."

22:47:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, that's caused a lot of tension too, that they're blaming on us."

22:47:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And I'm guessing we really didn't have much to do with it?"

22:48:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We had nothing to do with the actual navy movements, but we were involved in some events following the incident that were influenced by the movements to a degree."

22:48:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Us as the corps didnt. It was a miltary thing, but the thing is, our government treats the mutuality as if they're still illegal unregs."

22:48:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, they're blaming it on a meeting we had for skim access that didn't come to a deal. But part of that meeting was the already present tensions."

22:48:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And the government won't discuss any effect the movements may have had on anything."

22:49:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Perhaps I should pass them a note about the siege on the Deep Wastes?"

22:49:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This is something they might be concerned about."

22:49:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "A group of pilots from all alliances wasn't able to fully crew a cruiser to defend."

22:49:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How would we fare alone, if such a siege came to our doorstep?"

22:49:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That's not really a good way to do things. I'll be the first to admit i'm not an expert on politics, but I do know that what's going down right now is not healthy. It doesn't take a smart person to figure that out."

22:49:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Probably not too well, I'm guessing."

22:52:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's even been a group of sepratists on Hyperion that want it to stop or to be granted independence, things are certainly not well right now."

22:52:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:52:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well the reason for the QSA failure isobviously not ours. It is because the AEU Government even prior to Best won't do their job to negotiate with the Council and it's clear they don't care to."

22:53:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Like I said, our goverment doesn't want to negotate with 'unregs', most likely. Look what happend to Lambert. That's one of their scape goats. Hopefully we can get him reinstated."

22:54:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:54:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But they want to point the blame back at us when nobody from the AEU government even bothered to show up when the original meeting occurred."

22:54:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Which is totally not cool. If you're going to be in any position of power, the least you could do is to, you know, do your job. It makes everyone else's jobs, and lives for that matter, a lot easier to deal with."

22:54:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "People blame the easiest to blame usually, Lily."

22:54:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

22:54:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Playing the blaming game doesn't help either. But we all knew that already."

23:01:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello AEU."

You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

23:02:12 You put a gentle kiss on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's space suit helmet.

23:02:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Tara. How's it going?"

23:02:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Good. Searching for artifacts."

23:02:51 Please enter a valid channel to transmit on.

23:02:59 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

23:03:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nice! I hope they're not hiding too much."

23:03:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Found four so far. Two pieces of hull plate im not exactly sure the composition of, and I think some AEU tech."

23:03:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "And a drive core."

23:03:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule."

23:03:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Very cool!"

23:03:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I'm almost at a hundred sectors traveled."

23:03:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Constantine."

23:03:58 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

23:04:00 You peer out...

23:04:00 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

23:04:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:04:10 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:04:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:04:11 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:04:43 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:05:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So yesterday I was flying around looking at some stuff."

23:05:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah?"

23:05:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I did find that Ather's book is just missing the long-range scout's speed bonus."

23:05:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So the only advantage the void piercer has over our scout is the extra 6 battery hours."

23:05:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which admittedly is a lot of battery time."

23:06:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I don't think the price is worth that six extra hours."

23:06:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Oops. That."

23:06:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Miscomm!"

23:06:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I suppose it depends on how you want to use it. If you want to explore deep out in space, I guess it might be."

23:07:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But yeah, it's expensive."

23:07:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Unless you meant you meant the price of not having guns."

23:07:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nah, I don't think so. Especially since the void piercer has no weapons."

23:07:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is heavy, indeed."

23:07:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I also saw read the Magnetar's description for the first time."

23:08:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It sort of makes me think Best financed its production."

23:08:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is interesting."

23:08:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Why's that?"

23:08:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It's also interesting that the Magnetar is still up for sale, even though the Arrow isn't."

23:08:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The description is all about making the Union great again, and how this ship shows we don't need other alliances to be successful."

23:09:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, it is, but the Explorer Corps no longer exists."

23:09:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but it's weird that it's still listed at all."

23:09:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Im still determined to get my hands on that ship. Wow, really, about the descrption."

23:09:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know."

23:09:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The other ship we can no longer buy isn't listed."

23:10:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

23:10:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think if the Union hasn't collapsed in six months, we can get those ships if we want them."

23:10:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And work at it."

23:10:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd love to go art hunting some time. But I need to get more points and all that shtuff before I even consider doing that."

23:10:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, we can certainly try."

23:11:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think we just need to show that exploration is profitable."

23:11:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is something we can do."

23:11:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "It takes a lot of patience."

23:11:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, but so does living in general. *chuckles*."

23:11:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it would really help if we lead an all-AEU expedition."

23:11:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Even a small one."

23:11:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I've traveled a hundred and three sectors, and from that? Four artifacts."

23:11:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just to show there are enough people in the corps interested."

23:12:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ehh. That's not fun."

23:12:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It gets better once you can cross a sector in under ten seconds."

23:12:35 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Fuller 'n A Tick". The organization has earned 1,562,817.00 credits.

23:12:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah I don't have engines like that."

23:12:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I gotta get a double speed plant."

23:12:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know people have considered putting together all AEu expeditions in the passed."

23:12:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This term I want to put a long-range artifacting trip together."

23:13:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I'm all for both of those ideas."

23:13:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or maybe suggest that you and Lily put one together, and help with planning."

23:13:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

23:13:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Since I can't outfit a ship with Farport gear."

23:13:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We can definitely look into that."

23:14:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And then next term I want to try to lead an expedition, though my distance might be severely limited without the upgrades."

23:14:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We're just not sure with the political climate that it's the best time to go, but it seems like no time is really the best. I think we just need take off and head out."

23:15:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed, it would be ideal if the strike wasn't on when we did."

23:16:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "To be honest, if you think about it.. if most of the AEU civilian pilots went on this expedition, it'd be no different then striking until we get back with our findings anyway."

23:16:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well that's a good point."

23:16:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's very true."

23:17:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone sighs.

23:17:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wish this mess would end."

23:17:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to get back to being a regular pilot guy."

23:17:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So do I."

23:18:08 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sean, you want three sensing arrays?"

23:18:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "We need to plan ways to keep the crews attention to, since there are definetly slow periods during expeditions. I learned that well on the expedition with Johann and everyone. I had things to do, but it was real slow at times."

23:18:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But we do what we gotta do."

23:18:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh that's a good idea."

23:18:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah Tara. That's just the nature of expeditions."

23:18:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I'll concoct an eloborate murder mystery dinner for my expedition."

23:19:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "He probably isn't paying attention Ather. But yes, that's what he's after."

23:19:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You know, or something."

23:19:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "A few people slept through most of the trip since they were apparently that bored. Just being on the trip is exciting enough for me, but not everyone is that enthusastic about it."

23:19:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've still never been on one."

23:19:38 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "What the heck is one person going to do with three sensing arrays!?"

23:19:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It was Constantine, in the engineering room, with the hyperspanner."

23:19:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

23:19:49 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Sit on them and hope they hatch."

23:19:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sounds bout right."

23:20:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

23:20:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Part of expeditions is also just socializing and getting to know each other."

23:20:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And getting in fistfights."

23:20:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Apparently."

23:21:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Were none of those on my trip."

23:21:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, that's definitely an option."

23:21:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

23:21:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's good."

23:21:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Lexie pasted just about everyone with snowballs though."

23:21:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

23:21:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, we've had water fights too. Those are fun!"

23:21:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores gasps.

23:22:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Hopefully away from the electronics!"

23:22:11 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Fucker better not be giving them away to people, I'll fuck his life."

23:22:57 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Think I'll wait to make sure until he's paying attention before I craft them."

23:23:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I mean, Lily and I have just headed of to Andy's and Tom Town and then on to Sea of Fears by ourselves. Just the two of us. It was a great time to get to know each other and such."

23:23:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, something like that could be good for the artifacting trip."

23:24:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "She mentioned that you need a carrier upgrade from Andy's anyway."

23:24:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought we could take a carrier or two loaded with a module scout and people's artifacting ships."

23:24:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, thought she was going to upgrade the org carrier."

23:24:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Set up a recharge station out there, and just camp out for a few days."

23:25:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, if we take carriers, then Hall of Pain would be better. Carriers don't have the best charge."

23:25:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

23:26:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Sea of Fears, Hall of Pain, Vale of Anguish."

23:26:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Are there any happy places in the universe?"

23:26:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Maybe we'll find a place named Rainbow road."

23:26:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone cheers.

23:27:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm sure there are."

23:27:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "So far I think the most beautiful places in space are Nebulas."

23:28:00 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There! Problem solved."

23:28:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Those are pretty cool. I like seeing neutron stars and pulsars. They're amazing!"

23:28:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "The Magnetar was actually named after a type of Neutron star."

23:28:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep, I know."

23:28:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

23:29:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Much like the Pulsar."

23:29:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We love our star naming schemes."

23:29:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

23:29:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We co."

23:29:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Er, we do."

23:29:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I apparently am not awake enough to be able to talk,."

23:30:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

23:32:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I even named my cruiser with a star reference."

23:32:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyone interested in beacons?"

23:32:19 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Yes."

23:32:41 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Beacons, beacons. All the beacons."

23:32:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If I ever get a cruiser."

23:33:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I might name it after the Christabel mountains."

23:33:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "In some fashion."

23:34:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Mines going to be named 'Too many Lasers'"

23:34:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

23:34:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "A league pilot could name theirs after that one wall."

23:34:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The one you can see from space."

23:34:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "The great wall or whatever?"

23:34:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah!"

23:35:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, it was an impressive sight on my first approach to old earth."

23:36:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never seen them, but I've read about the walls around Istanbul on Old Earth."

23:36:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The Theodosian Walls."

23:36:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I could name mine that, since it used to be Constantinople."

23:36:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone chuckles.

23:36:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'll try again later."

23:39:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I know what to call the cruiser, Constantine! Just for you: 'Taraiscool'"

23:40:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

23:40:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Still a great name."

23:41:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

23:41:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, I'm going to continue aggressively sitting in my ship and watching the holo."

23:41:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I'll see what Vanta is up to."

23:41:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll catch you guys later."

23:42:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Im just watching SSn while I travel through space."

23:42:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I got a sleeping bag off there the other day."

23:42:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Nice. They kept selling grocery bags on it yesterday."

23:42:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "For a couple days every time I turned it on it was just underwear."

23:42:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "See you later Constantine."

23:43:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I mean I guess is good."

23:43:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "To have options."

23:43:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Well, if someone wants luxury comfort boxers, theres some silk satin boxers for sale right now."

23:43:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, ".. Speaking of underwear."

23:43:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

23:43:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

23:43:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Tara, you need to find a cute, special someone to go artifacting with you. Then it's not so boring."

23:43:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

23:45:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "These boxers are worth way too much."

23:47:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Oh nice, A long trenchcoat."

23:47:17 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 202,303.31 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
