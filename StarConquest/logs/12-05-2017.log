01:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:45 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:45 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:45 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:46 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:46 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:46 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:46 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:46 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:46 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

01:46 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:46 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:47 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:47 You scramble to your feet.

01:47 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:47 You exit the ship.
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

01:47 [The Torus; Garage]

01:47 You can go up.

01:47 Board what?

01:47 You can't go that way.

01:47 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

01:47 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and a small mystic purple bioplastic crate here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:47 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

01:47 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

01:47 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:47 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
