--------------------------------------------------
The four-person surveyor is the beginning starship for any AIE explorer. The
ship boasts an advanced sensory system which allows for the early detection and,
consequently, avoidance of large obstacles that might catch any other starship
by surprise in uncharted space. In addition, it comes standard with ten days of
charge, a subwarp drive, a slip drive, and ample storage space. The only area
this starship lacks is weaponry, as it was designed for exploration rather than
combat.
The Transverser boasts the next step in propulsion technology; the wavewarp
drive. Using the wavewarp technology, the starship "rides" through space using
rapidly generated energy pulses which propel the ship forward. Unfortunately (or
fortunately, depending on your purposes), this energe pulse causes a shockwave
which will damage any nearby starships or small objects. This technology is
frowned upon for regular use, as it damages anything in its path indiscriminatel
y, but it can be a valuable tool for the explorer in a pinch. A patch is
required for the wavewarp drive to function within the NAVI system.
The runabout class, a basic design shared by all alliances, has been boosted
using alien technology that researchers discovered. After researching several
alien hull plates and field emitters, AIE scientists were able to create a new
EM field "skin" that will rest along a specially modified hull. The goal began
as a way to shield the craft against excessive damage, but had the unexpected
side effect of repelling proximity weapons and displacing them into alternate
coordinates, potentially damaging any starships in the vicinity. Research on a
shield has yielded no results of yet, but the AIE runabout is a formidable
opponent against forces who rely on proximity weapons to damage vessels.
