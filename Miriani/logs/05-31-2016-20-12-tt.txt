Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a gray leather captain's chair, a glossy pearl gray ceramic felo chow
bowl, Maria Mitchell the humanoid service robot, an old obese red soldier felo,

no less that 30 at all hours.
[MTTS] lunarfang: Well with the other 2 big space games, miriani and promo
being. Well questionable lately this is the only place for true roleplayers. If
you're into a space game like this.
[MTTS] lunarfang: Prometheus that is.
[MTTS] andawn: Well, 95 of people on promo do not like rp.
[MTTS] tirok: Same goes for miriani, they don't either.

Wrong.

Even if roleplaying a draconic lizard instead of a human is always better.
[MTTS] andawn: I got bitched at for trying to rp my character the way I wanted.
Fuck that.
[MTTS] lunarfang: Pyrians have potential, but. No background. Yeah I'm playing a
human here, but at least there's an indepth background. Sad, because I liked my
pyrian over there. Pitty I can't do the third person speach over here like I do
there. It would be wierd from a human.
[MTTS] Myrv: I've always been under the impression that I'm in the minority here
as a sighted person.
[MTTS] andawn: And if the player bace from miriani came here, they'd be out in
seconds, if the keep achting the way they do on there.
[MTTS] andawn: I no who you are on there now!
[MTTS] lunarfang: The playerbase from prometheus would be out in seconds too.

aren't used to the way that things are run here.
[MTTS] lunarfang: Nope I'm not flower. I'm sutar.
[MTTS] andawn: Nah, flower is not on here, at least I don't think so.
[MTTS] muhala: Speaking about yourself in the third person is wierd regardless
of what race you and asking for something over and over on OOC channel just so
you can have it happen to yoyu IC isn't rp.
[MTTS] andawn: If I want something to happen ic, I make it happen. I don't go
complaining to hosts to make it happen.
[MTTS] lunarfang: I never did it on their ooc channel. It was just something
totally different and that char had a ton of personality.
[MTTS] andawn: You quit then, like I did?
[MTTS] lunarfang: Neither do I. Though I really should assist and find out how
long I'm banned from speaking on newbie for.

banned here, and too scared to assist to find out if it's perminant.
[MTTS] ricolachen: Guys, judging from the number of people who left the channel,
you're anoying people by talking about other games on here.
[MTTS] andawn: Way I do things here in gaming is promo is a no no, miriani is
wehre I go to let off steam, and here is where i'm mostly focused, trying to rp
an interesting character.
[MTTS] lunarfang: Shutting up now.
[MTTS] B.A.: I've been trying to figure out what the playerbase supposedly being
mostly sighted or mostly not has to do with anything since you made that
comment, Andawn. I'm probably missing something contextual.
[MTTS] lunarfang: Some people say that the sighted players are better gunners
because they can look at the starmap. But I don't see it.
[MTTS] andawn: It's just what I was told is this moo isn't good for blind
players because most of the player bace was sited. I'm glad I ignored that and
came here anyway, though.

[Starship "Intrepid"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

whatever works!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "RATS? A RATS suit?"

many lenses to make the security humanoid one."

one? Must be only higher tier suits."

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Star Conquest Help: Einrophones
--
Category: Communication
--
Einrophones, short for "Einstein-Rosen telephones," are telephone-like devices
that use wormholes for faster-than-light communication. With an einrophone, you
can engage in two-way communication with any other einrophone user.
HOW TO USE AN EINROPHONE
Phones are simple! Most tasks can be accomplished by typing USE PHONE. This
command is used, just for example, to dial a number, answer a call, or hang up.
Once connected, it's even simpler. Just talk naturally using the SAY command to
speak over your phone. The phone picks up all sounds your character makes,
including social commands!
WHERE TO GET AN EINROPHONE
You can find an einrophone shop in your capital's spaceport. Simply go there and
purchase a phone of your choice. Once you have the phone, type USE PHONE in
order to register a number for it.
Your number will be a 4-digit code corresponding to your character's place of
origin, followed by a 5-digit code unique to your phone.
Because cadet players have not yet submitted their profile and determined their
place of origin, they cannot register a phone. Cadets may, however, use a
payphone.
MAKING A CALL
You make a call by typing USE PHONE and choosing the appropriate option. You
must have the 9-digit number of the person you wish to reach in order to make a
call.
Alternatively, you can dial "00" (that's two zeroes) to reach Directory
Assistance, which can look up persons and locations if their number is publicly
listed.
CONTACTS
Your personal phone can store a list of contacts: friends and others you speak
to frequently. You can manage your contacts by typing USE PHONE and choosing the
appropriate option.
Have the other person's number ready when you choose to add a contact. You may
choose to give the contact any label you like. You can then dial with this
label, as opposed to remembering the number.
You can expand your phone's memory with specialized memory cards. These are not
sold, but rather are crafted by other players. Ask around, or check your local
Space Market!
MISSED CALLS
If your phone is silenced, or if you slept right through all the ringing, your
phone will log a missed call when you don't answer. You can see these by typing
USE PHONE and choosing the appropriate option, then you may, of course, call
back if you choose!
PHONE ACCESSORIES
Your phone can be accessorized with phone covers, holsters, and more. In order
to use these, type ATTACH (other object) TO PHONE. It's just that simple!
In the case of a phone holster, the holster itself will seem to "disappear," but
your phone will now be wearable.
Using a second accessory of the same type will detach the first one and put it
back in your hand.
LANDLINES
A "landline" phone is much the same as your personal phone, but it's tied to one
location and does not move. You will find payphones and phone booths scattered
through settled space. In addition, each civilian liaison office has its own
phone.
Landline phones work much the same, but will generally lack a memory for
contacts and some other features. Instead of picking up the phone itself, you
will use the handset. While you have the handset, others cannot hear the other
side of the conversation, though they can of course hear you speak.
You may type GIVE PHONE TO (someone else) in order to pass the handset over. USE
the phone again to hang up.
PAYPHONES AND COLLECT CALLS
Payphones, as the name indicates, are not free! Someone is being charged every
time one is used. You can see the rate charged by a payphone by looking at it.
Alternatively, many payphones allow collect calls. If you don't have enough for
a call yourself, you may make a collect call. The person you are calling may
choose to accept the charges and allow your call. To call collect, dial "9090"
followed by the number you wish to reach.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather sofa, and a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array." here.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole

other pilots interested in trying and seeing what they do."
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

they give benefits to."
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for docking clearance.
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "Well, what do they take
away from?"

leaving you in a dim silence.
Lily Kaise glides out.
The airlock hatch chimes quietly.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Have you checked life support?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Maybe there's a plant that
enhances life support capacity."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Did you check to see if the
ship changed color."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Checked life support."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Did you check engine
acceleration and deceleration?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Fuck if I remember. I believe
one of them takes away from max velocity, and if memory serves, the other one
takes away from something or other in the grid? It's been a while."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Checked all that."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Did you check magnitude of
secondary access effects? Maybe instead of reducing cooldown, it makes the boost
even better!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We even tried to see if the
rift trim could go over 100%."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Dunno how we'd really check
that."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "You would have your engineer
watch the status boards like a hawk while you boost."

are maybe the plants reduce the drain penalty you incur when recharging the
active long range sensor or hypercaster, another effect no one would pay much
attention to."
The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Ardsley; Landing Pad.
