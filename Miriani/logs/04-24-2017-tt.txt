[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station; Docking Bay.

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear
Temporary Station; Docking Bay.
You see a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval dark purple and
light purple cloth rug, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted
tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated
green cooler, a small white trash bin, a white microwave oven, Kiska the

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

popular choice for new pilots. The fighter is a combat ship. It has absolutely
no facility for anything that needs cargo, like salvaging or scooping, but if

ship."

all still at war with the outsiders. So combat skills are important, but really
salvaging and other industrial activities are also necesary for new supplies. At
the moment, while you are a cadet and getting a feel for everything, I would
focus on the activities you can do by yourself. I first got a salvager and then
a few days later I got a fighter for the combat missions from Space Vermin
patrol."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Zola Azura transmits, "Understood. Thank you
for the advice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Way I figure, drive
and motovation are always good for the Alliance."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And a good work
ethic is something people can respect'"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, sure, but also
thoughtfulness and consideration. And people who are not always working
themselves into the ground. Balance is important."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey I'll assist
someone here if they need but that credit is a good motovatior too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And I am all about
the credits."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You have absolutely
no idea what rich is, just wait a few months."

wings boards a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag, tugs experimentally at
various pieces of it, then gets bored and swims off.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Those 200 or 300
thousand credits for a load of debris? That is nothing."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl,
Purr the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small bubbling neon
blue-lit toroidal aquarium containing red and blue aquatic life and round rocks,
a small purple trash bin, and Xavier the big silver soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

it's good to be skilled, or at least know a good deal, of as many aspects of
pilot work that you can."

annoying, but it's not!"
