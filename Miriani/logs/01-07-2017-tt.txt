Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok."
Lily Kaise glides up.
A small light near the massive bay door blinks for a few seconds, then the door
begins to slowly slide closed. After a moment, air begins to fill the bay.

 You are wearing a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver
stars, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas
sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You
are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a
gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red
shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a
leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping
xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse,
a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black
engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both
hands are left uncovered.
You are carrying nothing.
The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise ask, "'can you go out with me

Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "'can you go out with me to 777?"

The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its
existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased
destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris
still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.
Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting
vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to Mir."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

You say, "Er, worth."

You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's

ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a
planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The
wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an
eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Welcome
to Artifact Alpha 777. Here you will find Grade 20 to 40 Shipwrecks to grapple
which you may transfer to the Salvage processor in this sector. Also you will
find some of the best Local Artifacts around in this area! To return, be certain
you are in this sector. Then TRAVEL to Home Alpha 776 or just 776 will do!"

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Subject: Salvage Processor Now Online in Artifact alpha 777
Author: Lily Kaise
Posted: 01:50  7 January 2317 GST
--
The Salvage processor which alternates between Asteroid alpha 285 and Artifact
alpha 777 is now available in Artifact Alpha 777.
This Salvage processor will be available for the next 12 days.
There are grade 20 to 40 Shipwrecks in Artifact Alpha 777 so enjoy earning some
extra Industry as you hunt Local Artifacts in Artifact Alpha 777.
To travel to Artifact Alpha 777, jump to Mir (not Battle of Mir) Then TRAVEL to
777. You will be levied a Toll of 1,000,000 EAOS Credits so be certain to have
sufficient EAOS Credits in your Credit Assistant to accomodate this toll.
To return, be certain that you are in the Artifact Alpha 777 Sector and TRAVEL
to 776 which is the Home Beacon. Navigate one Sector east to Mir and jump to
wherever you desire.
Please note that we are still experimenting with whether to continue to
alternate this Salvage processor between Asteroid Alpha 285 and with Artifact
alpha 777. Therefore, your input is appreciated. I am not at work for many hours
each day currently so dropping a note in the mail to me or to shule Elemmire or
Melinda would be appreciated as we want to accomodate those who express their
preference.

#Miriani
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
02:53:33
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new
updraft.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
