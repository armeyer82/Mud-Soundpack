Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your
periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy
white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the
distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a large
oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with
a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across
the toes here.

Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, any bari flesh makes the soldier gene stronger though.
We were able to determine that with relative ease."
Morris Corlew nods.
Ather Jammoa says, "That's why back in the day, when that one chunk of Grenwold
was infested, we use to purposely cause infestations onto our own ships.
Controlled ones that would be purposed to make our felo soldier genes stronger."
'Makes sense.
You say, "Makes sense."
Morris Corlew says, "Liam wrote that it seemed to also make the bari stronger."
A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an
orange glowing interior pulsates gently.
Ather Jammoa says, "Back then the genes went away faster."
Morris Corlew nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Guess we've kinda helped the felo evolve in a way."
Ather Jammoa says, "Unfortunately, there is nowhere else one can purposely
create controlled infestations."
Ather Jammoa says, "Those other ships all took off."
Ather Jammoa says, "They became spreaders."
Morris Corlew shudders. "Yeah, I've uh..."
Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings. "Taken care of one that was."
A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing
beneath the ocean waves.
Morris Corlew says, "Not from that infestation, but...a courier."
Ather Jammoa says, "Be happy you haven't seen the cruiser."
Morris Corlew nods.
Morris Corlew says, "I think I might have to change my boxers if I did to be
honest."
Ather Jammoa says, "You don't want hyperbari in a ship that doesn't have a good
population of felo."
Eli Grey asks, "Oh god.. That must have happened when I was on my little hiatus,
You mean all those ships on the Grenwold chunk? the ones that were all stuck
together with bari gooeyness?"
Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.
Morris Corlew says, "Eww."
Eli puts his hand on his face and says into his palm.. "fuck..."
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
Ather Jammoa pats Eli Grey on the back.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
Morris says to Ather, "How many are there? I knew about the cruiser runnin
around, but that's it."
Ather Jammoa sighs.
Ather Jammoa says, "Thanks to Peter, there are too many."
Eli Grey says, "I didn't have a sip there, but I remember all those ships there,
it was several."
Morris Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa.
Morris Corlew says, "Sheesh."
The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the
water.
Ather Jammoa says, "He released a bunch of spreaders, then a bunch of cargo
haulers and flitters and stuff from grenwold became spreaders."
Ather Jammoa says, "Then there was a Mule that also ended up becoming a
spreader."
Morris Corlew says, "That bari spreader ship I was on still gives me nightmares
from time to time."
Eli Grey says, "Oh wait, I was around when that happened.. I just didn't realize
the ships from Grenwold launched."
Morris Corlew says, "I'd seen it jump before I realized that's what was goin
on."
Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.
Morris Corlew says, "So all these dreams...well most of 'em, end in that thing
jumpin while I was aboard."
Morris Corlew says, "I kinda have a...thing about killin bari. Any
opportunity...I'm happy to do it."

Aisling the Fox
She appears to be 34 years old. She is about six feet and two inches tall and
has freckled skin. Her body is lithe with bony hips and thin calves. She has
slender shoulders and a small bust. Her face is mousey, heavily-freckled, and
girlish, with a button nose and round chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and
rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set
of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are green and round. Her ankle-length, frizzy
hair is fiery red and hanging in a single braid. She has bitten pale
fingernails. She has a shimmering green and gold shamrock in her hair.
Her face is tattooed with a delicate band of green labyrinthian knotwork,
consisting of several overlapping and swirling cords, that stretches from ear to
ear and across the bridge of her nose.
 She is wearing a white pointelle beret, a cute little plush calico cat with
brilliant green eyes, an intricately designed charcoal gray shipsuit, and a pair
of scuffed old boots. She is also wearing a solid silver ring engraved with
intricate Celtic knots, a matte orange oxide wrist-mounted chronometer, a
necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points,
a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a large expandable
telescoping xenology container, a worn and tattered brown leather satchel, a
black digital felo game, an orange touch einrophone in a black leather phone
holster, a rune-carved and lacquered rowan wood keychain, an orange vibro-baton,
and a Tardick lizard named Thor perched on her shoulder. Her face, both eyes,
neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The thunder abates and sunlight once again beams through the viewports. The ants
resume their orderly, single-file journey.
Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around

The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly fades.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.
The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into
quickly evaporating smoke.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.
A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
The room grows a bit more chill.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly

For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship
becomes more noticeable.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly into the area.
A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

Listen. You need to be careful.
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
Remember what I said.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of
machine-gun fire.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent
to its surroundings.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.
The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship
is back in the riftflow.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly east.
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a red shipsuit with silver trim around the collar and cuffs and
a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light
purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant
white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both
wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Astable         Similar to chaotic storms but are prone to shifting
Chaotic         Gusty. You will find you are sometimes going faster than the
local flow inside the storm
Churning             Force your heading and control your sails. Will spin around
so that you tend to exit and 
               then reenter them.
Energetic            Zap you. A little disorienting, as the "scene" changes
every time energy is discharged 
               into the ship. Particularly bad for the drive.
Hazy                 Seem to have jagged edges. It's possible to ride the edge
of these and go in and out of 
               them. Tend to be slightly slower local flow than some storm
types.
Phasing         Move you deeper or shallower in the rift.
Strange         Can telelport. Otherwise similar to an energetic storm.
Artificial Energetic storms are most often formed when there are other storms in
the area
Artificial storms generally last a little over an hour (or about 5.5 subcycles)
Permanent Calm: Spinward Clan Space

have time for questions. Firstly, we are detecting an inordinately sized fleet
of Praelor ships, yet again on a direct route for Sector 32. It's unclear
whether they may make a detour. Our reconnaissance is reporting as the situation
updates. It may be hours until they reach our local sectors, and I have several
captains actively pursuing and attempting to waylay them, which means they may
not arrive at all. Please be on your guard, however. Secondly, we have been
continuously working to deter the effect of the Kritzn. I cannot give much more
than that, but the information regarding what we're working on will become
declassified as of next week and we will brief you as circumstances dictate.
Finally, I've received word about what a phenomenal job everyone has been doing
on restoring the Hale's catapult. I'm sure The Hale Collective government is
very thankful for your contributions and will acknowledge you accordingly when
everything is said and done. Good luck!"[0m

The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air
before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Eli Grey says, "Been a long time since the sensors picked up anything
interesting."
Morris Corlew nods.
Eli Grey says, "I bet Pierre was right about us passing up some interesting
things."
Eli Grey shrugs.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec shrugs helplessly.
A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines
pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.
Morris Corlew says, "I'm sure we do. Not much that can be done about it
unfortunately. Storms kill the sensors. Unless we stopped for all storms...which
would waste a lot of time when you have no real destination in mind."
Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "Must have been the party planet. So much partying
generated storms."
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Current speed will provide
plenty of time to spot things."
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Your face is scaring all of the points of interest
away. If you cover it up and start looking halfway decent things will inevitably
change."
Vernos Bailey strolls south.
Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.
Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered
silver stars.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I think throwing you in
furnace will help more."
The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air
before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.
Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "It would not. My internal mechanisms will trigger a
violent explosion."
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings
stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.
Morris says to Ather, "You're just tryin to scare him to save yourself."
Ather Jammoa says, "Irrelevant."
Vernos Bailey says to Ather, "I would call that an abrupt short term boost."
Morris Corlew laughs.
Vernos Bailey says, "The end of that boost however outweighs the benefit of the
boost."
Morris says to Vernos, "Maybe not."
Morris Corlew grins.
A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines
curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.
Vernos says to Morris, "I need help for help with redefining the name of AEU so
it is not so jokingly talked about."
Vernos Bailey says, "His help I mean."
Morris says to Vernos, "He's part of the cause."
Morris Corlew looks at Vernos Bailey and shrugs.
Jason Rat says, "Going to go take a nap."
Morris says to Jason, "Rest well."
Vernos Bailey says, "Rest well Jason."
Jason Rat says, "Thanks."
Jason Rat stands up from a white leather sofa.
Jason Rat jogs south.
Vernos says to Morris, "Need a adquate example then?"
Morris says to Vernos, "Of what?"
Vernos Bailey shrugs.
Morris says to Vernos, "No pilot exists that is the embodiment of what you want
the AEU to be. Which is why change just won't happen over night, not in
actuality and not in perception."
Vernos Bailey says, "Eh I was just providing reasons not to throw him in the
furnace."
Morris says to Vernos, "Even when it does happen in actuality, it'll be awhile
it'll take awhile before percep- Oh."
Vernos Bailey nods.
Vernos Bailey says, "How to kill a conversation."
Vernos Bailey says, "Mention the AEU."
Vernos Bailey smirks.
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Morris Corlew says, "Conversations ebb and flow."
Ather says to Vernos, "And you have to remember, I'm not really a prime example
to follow. I could genuinely care less what the other alliances think of us. The
image of the AEU does need to be improved, but not for the sake of pacifying
anyone in particular, just for the sake of the AEU. Though to be honest, with
the way things have been shaping up out there with the Outsiders and the Allied
pirates in particular, I don't really mind the shift towards military technology
development. That doesn't mean tiat I agree with all of President Best's
campagne promises. I definitely hope he doesn't try to pull the alliance out of
the Accord, for instance, or try to start shit with the other alliances. So far,
he hasn't relaly done anything about either."
A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, I would wait until
the first hint of those super amazing military toys to be actual made before
doing so if I was him."
Ather Jammoa says, "That being said, a lot of the people from the AEU do seem to
want to start exploring again, and I got no issue with that personally. They can
all do whatever they want. Especially if they actually lead an expedition
instead of just talking about leading one, which has been the case for a while
now with a few exceptions."
Vernos Bailey says, "Eh my goals for this trip are to get a taste of what
expeditions are like. Not piss off people enough to get invited on more in the
future and to have a good time while spending time with others."
Ather Jammoa grins at Vernos Bailey.
Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.
Ather says to Vernos, "Don't think you've managed to piss anyone off yet!"
Vernos Bailey says, "I will hold off on checking that off my list until we
return."
Vernos Bailey says, "At most, I might be a mild annoyance since my jokes fall
flat sometimes."
Ather Jammoa says, "Eh."
Ather Jammoa says, "Everyone's jokes flal flat sometimes."
Damien Goss nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
Damien Goss says, "Lots of mine apparently start out flat."
Ather Jammoa says, "Don't think anyone's going to call you out for a lame joke."
Morris Corlew says, "Mine have a rather high...rate of it."
Luja Garland steps in from the south.
Luja Garland sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow
with thick silver fringe.
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.
Morris Corlew nods to Luja Garland.
Luja Garland says, "Hello."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Allo."
Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic
crater.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
Morris Corlew says, "Welcome to hell, folks."
Vernos Bailey says, "I thought that was anywhere where all of us existed."
Luja Garland asks, "What does the thing on the gate mean?"
Vernos Bailey smirks.
Morris says to Vernos, "Heh heh heh."
Vernos says to Luja, "Basically those who venture forth are damned and will not
return."
Damien Goss says, "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
Luja Garland frowns.
Vernos Bailey says, "What he said."
Vernos Bailey says, "I just loosely translated it."
Morris Corlew says, "It's straight from an Old Earth poem."
Damien Goss says, "Semantics are important. There's a difference between what it
says and what you said."
Luja Garland exclaims, "Abandon hope, even if you might make it out just fine!"
Luja Garland says, "Is how I interpret it."
Damien Goss shakes his head.
Morris says to Luja, "Abandon hope for ever leaving too."
Luja Garland says, "Oh."
Morris says to Luja, "Every shred of hope."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Damien Goss says, "The hope that breakfast will be there tomorow, the hope that
your shirt will stay dry, everything. It however does not you are damned."
Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.
Damien Goss says, "It just means that if you pass this point you shouldn't
expect anything good."
Vernos Bailey says, "Yet lucifer waits at the end."
Morris Corlew nods.
Vernos Bailey says, "I would say that is a pretty good argument for the damned
part."
Morris Corlew says, "But...he is also tormented."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Morris Corlew nods.
Vernos Bailey says, "True."
Luja Garland asks, "Who's tormented? The oarsman?"
Damien Goss says, "Everyone in hell."
Morris Corlew says, "Everyone. Even Satan himself."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Vernos Bailey says, "Hell was created to torment lucifer the way I see it."
Luja Garland says, "Wow. Sounds like the worst place ever."
Damien Goss says, "And according to some belief systems even a trip to hell is
just a passage to atone for your sins before you supposedly are allowed throught
he gates of heaven."
Morris Corlew says, "Hell was created for torment of...everyone. Everything.
Hell is...lack of hope. hell is pain. Hell is torment and torture."
Morris Corlew nods to Luja Garland.
Vernos Bailey says, "Even he who is the overlord is also a tormented soul in
hell."
Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.
Aisling the Fox asks, "What are you talking about?"
Luja says to Aisling, "Hell."
Damien Goss says, "Well yeah I mean he was anangel until he became too prideful
and was thrust out of heaven."
Morris Corlew nods.
Luja Garland asks, "Who was?"
Luja Garland asks, "The oarsman?"
Damien Goss says, "Lucifer."
Luja Garland asks, "What about Satan?"
Aisling the Fox says, "Not really clear in concept."
Damien Goss says, "They are the same."
Morris Corlew says, "The oarsman is just a worker assisting in trasnport of
souls."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Luja Garland asks, "Literally?"
Damien Goss nods to Luja Garland.
Luja Garland says, "Oh."
Damien Goss says, "He has many names, Lucifer, Satan, Old Cob, The Father of
Lies, etcetera."
Luja Garland asks, "Is he the devil?"
Damien Goss nods.
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.
Morris Corlew says, "Devil, Satan, Lucifer, on and on."
Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.
Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Aisling the Fox says, "Lots of names for one person."
Damien Goss nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
Luja Garland says, "Yeah. I thought they were two people, and that none of 'em
were the oarsman."
Luja Garland frowns.
Damien Goss says, "I think that stems from the fact that nobody wanted to invoke
his name so they gave him multiple labels. I could be wrong though."

Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather
sofa, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver
projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation
bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, a medium aquarium containing yellow and
orange aquatic life and round rocks, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a
round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue

You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with

Morris Corlew nods. "He who must not be named."
Morris says to Damien, "That's the impression I got from a family lived near
me."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Damien Goss says, "Hence where the saying, 'Speak of the devil and he shall
appear.' comes from."
Damien Goss shrugs.
Morris Corlew nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines
pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.
Luja Garland exclaims, "Ahhh, I recognize that!"
Damien Goss says, "The oarsman though is different he is the one that ferries
souls across and down the river styx in Greek mythology originally, at least as
far as I've ever read."
Morris Corlew says, "Anyway, makes me wonder, if what we see in the rift really
does come from our shared consciousness, what brought up the Dante's Inferno
specifics."
Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Luja Garland asks, "Wait, is Dante also the devil?"
Morris Corlew says, "No."
Morris Corlew says, "Dante was an Italian poet."
Damien Goss says, "No Dante was a guy who made a deal with the devil."
Eli Grey says, "It almost has to be based on something with us, too many human
things to be anything otherwise."
Damien Goss says, "Or well yeah."
Morris Corlew says, "The poems are about that, yeah."
Damien Goss says, "He wrote about a guy that made the deal."
Morris Corlew nods.
Damien Goss asks, "What the hell was his name?"
Eli Grey says, "Imean.. one of hte riftscapes looks like an acient war from Old
Earth."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Eli Grey says, "Er.. ancient."
Morris Corlew asks, "I think he used his own name? It's been...wow, maybe...6
years?"
Damien Goss says, "The Dante story tells of a journey of this guy who I can't
remember the name of that makes a deal with the devil then when the devil calls
in his marker he goes through the circles of hell."
Eli Grey says, "I think he used his own name, if you are referring ot that old
poem."
Morris Corlew nods.
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
Morris Corlew says, "Had to read all of 'em in school. But been so long I don't
remember all that much. The scenes have brought way too much back for my likin
though."
Damien Goss shrugs.
Luja Garland says, "Sounds like a pretty neat horror movie."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Damien Goss says, "It probably would be."
Morris Corlew says, "Well, served up rift-style..."
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.
Damien Goss stands up.
Damien Goss steps south.
Damien Goss steps in from the south.
Damien Goss sits down.
Eli Grey says, "Yeah, someone should definintely make a horror holofilm based on
the rift."
Morris Corlew says, "Oh hey. We're speading back up."
Morris Corlew coughs. "Speeding."
Vernos Bailey says, "Well if you got ather to star in it, it would not even need
to be about the rift."
Morris Corlew laughs.
Morris Corlew says, "Ather could be the oarsman."
Eli Grey asks, "Speaking of HOrror films, anyone mind if I put on the Siren?"
Morris Corlew shrugs. "Sure."
Vernos Bailey says, "Go for it."
Damien Goss asks, "The siren?"
Eli Grey nods to Damien Goss.
Luja Garland asks, "What's that?"
Eli Grey removes a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies' from a maple coffee
table.
Damien Goss shrugs. "Never heard of it, but go ahead."
Eli Grey asks, "Anyone have a problem with sexual themes?"
Eli Grey removes a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" from a silver
plastic box labeled 'Movies'.
Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I have better movie disc."
Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "We don't wanna see your strip tease."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec removes a 10-panel film disc
titled "Best Of The WMOS, Volume Deux" from a small black leather backpack.
Eli Grey puts a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" in a silver projector.
Eli Grey laughs at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.
Eli Grey asks, "Is that really what I think it is?"
Eli Grey closes a silver projector.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Wait."
Eli Grey says, "Haha, a recording of the Moss channel, nice."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We must watch moss first."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec opens a silver projector.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec removes a 50-panel film disc

Luja Garland snickers.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec closes a silver projector.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sets a silver projector upright
and turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color show begins.
Eli Grey says, "Ok, it looks like a shorter one, sure."
Morris Corlew chuckles.
[From the projector] The camera shows some archival footage of the Premier
Maxime Roberge eating a poutine. Offscreen, you can hear something said in a
French Rimward accent, "Allo! These are more best moments of WMOS! Enjoy more
the moss! Ha! Ha!"
Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself.
[From the projector] The view pans slowly through a lush forest.
Luja Garland exclaims, "Ohh. It's her!"
Eli Grey smirks.
[From the projector] A fallen tree trunk gradually comes into view as the camera
pans.
[From the projector] Once the tree trunk is centered in view, the camera zooms
in slowly.
Eli Grey asks, "Ok we have to guess, is it goingto be moss, or not?"
[From the projector] You see a patch of greyish green upon the surface of the
tree trunk. The camera continues zooming in.
Eli Grey says, "Could be slime."
[From the projector] It becomes clear that the greyish green patch growing on
the tree trunk is indeed moss, perhaps lichen.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "It could be lichen."
Eli Grey says, "Nope, it was moss."
[From the projector] The camera zooms in to show the fine details of the mossy
growth.
Eli Grey cheers.
[From the projector] After a long, lingering gaze at the moss, the camera zooms
out and resumes panning around the forest.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings
stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.
[From the projector] A deep voice intones gravely, "You are watching... The Moss
Channel."
Aisling the Fox asks, "Someone recorded moss channel?"
[From the projector] The image fades to black for a moment.
Eli Grey points at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Yes."
The images above the holographic projector cease as the disc ends.
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Eli Grey says, "Wanted to watch that instead of The Siren."
Eli Grey laughs.
Morris Corlew says, "Leave it to Pierre."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Because you cannot watch
holovid on journeys."

Eli Grey grins.
Eli Grey says, "Ok."
Eli Grey sets a silver projector upright and turns it on. The three-dimensional
full-color show begins.
[From the projector] Soft, eerie violin music begins to play, and the black
screen slowly fills with stars.
[From the projector] Against the backdrop of stars, the words appear: "An
Oedipus Entertainment Presentation." The words slowly fade away.
[From the projector] New words in flowing silver script appear against the
stars: "The Siren." The violin music briefly swells and fades, and the screen
goes black.
[From the projector] The scene opens in the Chetumal spaceport. People are
everywhere. You hear tinny synthesized music, an unintelligible announcement
over the spaceport's PA system, and the sounds of many voices. A neon sign
flashes brightly over a nearby doorway.
[From the projector] The camera focuses on a tall, thin man in the crowd. His
lips seem twisted into a permanent sneer. He is wearing a faded black shipsuit
with red trim. He has short salt-and-pepper hair, and gray stubble covers his
chin.
The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the
water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle
impotently.
[From the projector] The man shoulders his way through the crowd. He bumps one
burly man, who stops as if to challenge him. But the thin man scowls at him, and
the other man turns and walks away.
[From the projector] The man makes his way to the spaceport bar, his craggy face
briefly but garishly illuminated by the neon sign over the doorway.
[From the projector] The bar is crowded. The man grumbles as he takes the only
open seat, which is near a group of young pilots in purple shipsuits. His eyes
narrow as he looks them over. "Cadets," he sneers. "IA cadets. Useless."
Morris Corlew says, "The siren and Dante's inferno."
Eli Grey smirks.
[From the projector] The man orders a mug of Chetumalian stout, takes a deep
drink, then slams the mug down and wipes his mouth with his sleeve. His
challenging stare wanders around the crowded, noisy bar, finally coming again to
rest on the young pilots at the next table.
Vernos Bailey says, "We should turn on the bubble for the holovid."
[From the projector] They are laughing. Their shipsuits are new. Their expensive
watches glimmer in the low light. "I don't care who he is," one of them declares
loudly. "I'll shoot him right out of the sky if he fucks with me!" The others
laugh in response.
Morris Corlew says, "Makes it more interesting."
Morris Corlew grins.
[From the projector] The man drinks his stout and leans back in his chair, his
legs stretched out before him. As he listens to the cadets, he begins to smile.
[From the projector] The scene switches back to the cadets. One of them is
snickering, his hands out as though shaped around a pair of large breasts. "And
she was like this!" he says. Suddenly a large mug of stout is slammed down on
the table in their midst.
[From the projector] They look up in surprise. The thin man is standing there.
"Mind if I join you?" he asks in a voice that demands they say yes. "Sure," one
of them says, gesturing vaguely around the table. The others shrug.
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.
[From the projector] The thin man sits down, forcing them to make room. Then he
stares at each one in turn, grins, and starts talking.
[From the projector] The night wears on. The cadets sit there quietly. You hear
the man's voice, telling tales of a rough life spent on the very outskirts of
civilization, of pirates and derelict ships full of dead bodies.
[From the projector] The cadets seem entranced. They lean forward, hanging on
his every word, apparently not noticing that his smile is mocking, his eyes full
of malice.
[From the projector] The scene changes. It is a lot later. The place is quiet
now. The bartender dries glasses at the bar. Only the cadets and the older man
are left. The cadets are silent. "There were body parts out there," the man
snarls. "But there always are."
[From the projector] The camera closes in on the man's sneering face. "But
that's not the worst thing," he says, his eyes narrowing. "No, the worst thing
is... the Siren."
[From the projector] The man leans close. The cadets listen helplessly, looking
slightly sick. "They say it's only a story, but..." Gradually, the man's voice
fades and the scene changes.
[From the projector] You see a dimly lit starship control room. A scruffy man is
slouched in the captain's chair. He scratches his leg as he stares out of the
viewport into a black expanse of space. Food wrappers and empty gelatin
containers are scattered around. His gray shipsuit is dirty, and he hasn't
shaved in a while.
[From the projector] The camera pans around the cramped control room. The
shadows in the corners are deep. Something moves there, but you can't see what
it is.
[From the projector] The man yawns hugely and settles down in the chair as
though he means to sleep. He reaches up and scratches the back of his neck. He
settles down again. A shadow moves behind him.
[From the projector] Suddenly, he sits up with a yelp and slaps at the back of
his neck. He looks at his hand. It appears normal.

cries out, startled, and in one swift motion, jumps out of the chair and whirls
around.

"Say boo!" Damien Goss pokes Luja Garland in the ribs!
[From the projector] A beautiful woman drifts there behind his chair, her long
black hair flowing around her naked body. She is voluptuous, her breasts large
and full, her hips womanly. Her smooth skin is oddly translucent, and stars seem
to shine from inside her.
Luja Garland exclaims, "Ack!"
Luja Garland exclaims, "I mean boo!"
[From the projector] She watches the man, an unearthly smile on her lush wet
lips. Her dark eyes are as black as the void of deep space.
[From the projector] "Wha...!" the man yells, his eyes wide with alarm. "How did
you get on my ship! Who the hell ARE you!" He backs away, only to be stopped by
the control panel behind him.
[From the projector] The woman smiles and cups her breasts, holding them out to
him, her luscious mauve nipples erect, her body swaying seductively.
[From the projector] The camera focuses on the man again. Gradually his
expression changes. His face grows slack and his eyes glaze over. He smiles as
though drunk.
[From the projector] Now you see the woman from the man's point of view. He is
in the chair, and she is straddling him, slowly and sensuously moving up and
down. Her dark eyes heavy-lidded and hungry, she smiles down at him.
Morris shifts on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick
silver fringe.
[From the projector] Her black hair seems to float in the air, filled with
stars. She arches her back, her naked body sinuously moving over him, her
breasts swaying heavily. You hear the man's gruff voice. "Yeah, baby, that's
right... Oh, yeah..."
Luja Garland exclaims, "Oh no, she's too seductive for anyone's good!"
Eli Grey laughs.
[From the projector] The camera circles the man, closing in on his now naked
torso. He is groaning, his hips jerking spasmodically. He is in the throes of
orgasm. The view changes slightly to the woman above him.
[From the projector] No one is there! No one at all. The man groans, thrusting
upward, his seed spurting into the empty air...
[From the projector] The scene cuts back to the bar on Chetumal. The cadets are
staring at each other in horror. They seem even younger now and not nearly so
brash. One reaches for his mug and gulps down the last of his lager.
[From the projector] The thin man sneers at them, saying, "She'll make you think
you have her, boys. But you won't. Remember that when you're out there alone.
She'll get you. Sooner or later, she'll get you."
Damien Goss says, "Sheesh, what an idiot."
[From the projector] You see the man walking away from the bar. He snickers to
himself. "Stupid IA," he mutters. "They'll believe anything."
[From the projector] The scene has changed. The man is seated in the control
room of his ship. The lights are low. The room is cramped and untidy, with
cables tangled across the floor and crates of junk stacked along the walls.
[From the projector] He leans forward, checking the navigation display. The
dimly lit screen shows that he is deep in uncharted space. "Stupid fucking
cadets," he says. Then he chuckles to himself. "Stupid fucking IA."
Morris scratches his head.

The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
[From the projector] He reaches into a cubbyhole beneath the control panel,
pulls out a bottle of dark liquid, uncaps it, and takes a deep swig. Laughing
unpleasantly, he holds the bottle to his chest. "Oughta go back. Tell 'em
another one."

You nod.
Vernos Bailey asks, "Should we recharge?"
[From the projector] He snickers. "Hell, fuck 'em. Dumbasses shouldn't be in

[From the projector] The scene changes again. The man is asleep, snoring, the
bottle nearly empty. Suddenly, he twitches and comes awake. He looks around,
blinking sleepily.
[From the projector] "What?" he mumbles, frowning. He sits up, turns his head,
looking back over his shoulder. Suddenly, he leaps to his feet.
Damien Goss says, "Got just over a day's worth of charge."
[From the projector] The woman is there, smiling, naked, her black hair swirling
around her.
[From the projector] The man's face fills first with disbelief and then with
horror. His mouth opens. He screams. The woman laughs softly. The scene fades to
black.
[From the projector] A long time has passed. The power in the ship's batteries
is waning. The lights are low. An empty bottle of liquor lies on the floor.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Shower]
This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small
sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some
effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be
completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several
grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. Lights

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

Ather Jammoa says, "I wonder if I should put any comments about the bypass key
in the pilot's guide to preparation."
Eli Grey asks, "I overheard someone mentioning that, what is the bypass key?"
Ather Jammoa says, "Basically allows you to fire your weapons without a
confirmation prompt."
Ather Jammoa says, "But, it's illegal."
Eli Grey says, "Oh, yeah I heard about that."
Ather Jammoa says, "If someone catches you using it, notably the engineer of the
ship in question or anyone who tags you, they can arrest you for it."
Eli Grey says, "I wouldn't want one of those anyways Idon't think. Maybe on a
fighter, but it's not really that much of an advantage."

prove yourself, and your desires to explore."

anyone can get. Rather than trying to be lofty and convince him you need your
own."

Vernos Bailey says, "I had idea for decoy signature but now thinking on that, it
would only work once."

Eli says to Vernos, "I thought it was a pretty solid idea, there's just
technical difficulties involved I think."
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.
Eli Grey says, "It would certainly be awesome if we could mask a smaller ships
signature with a larger ones, but I am pretty sure they're sensors are too good
for that."
Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow
with thick silver fringe.
Lily Kaise glides south.
Eli Grey says, "I mean, I can even pick that up on my long range scanner."
Eli Grey shrugs.
Melinda Michaels says, "Here's the problem with that."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Dunno if you can make a
rift probe looks like the Lowell from afar."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Woo we still have 6 percent of charge!"
Lily Kaise glides in from the south.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "If you can, send probes
everywhere."
Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow
with thick silver fringe.
Melinda Michaels says, "If you use a larger ship to mask a smaller ship, they
still get the reading from the larger ship."
Eli noggles at Pierre-Louis.
Melinda Michaels says, "So, even if the smaller ship gets through they've got
us."
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
Vernos Bailey says, "I'd launch a group of probes and make them give off the
signature of the lowell."
Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.
Vernos Bailey says, "Then that way it looks like two lowells."
Lily Kaise says, "Only have one."
Eli Grey says, "Making them give off the signature of the Lowell I dno't think
would work.. you'd ahve to have some massive power soruces on those little
probes for one."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Thousands of Lowell
everywhere."
Melinda Michaels says, "The ideal way to go is mask the larger ship so we go
undetected. Otherwise, they know we are looking and will step up their game in a
huge way."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Millions."
Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Lowells everywhere, in all
directions."
Eli says to Melinda, "I do like the idea of using deceptive energy signatures
though."
Vernos Bailey asks, "Wonder if the Accord has considered it?"
Melinda says to Eli, "Sure but there again, if we get caught fishing, we are
fucked."
Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.
Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.
Eli says to Melinda, "I mean for something besides getting to Jinu space."
Lily Kaise says, "Only if it could be deployed remotely and... that would be
interesting."
Eli Grey shrugs.
Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly we are fucked without the Jinu if the Outsiders
ever find the Mutuality."
Melinda Michaels says, "You send something in there looking like the Lowell,
they are gonna blow us out of the sky."
Eli Grey nods.
Eli Grey says, "They go apeshit as soon as the Lowell is detected."
Melinda says to Vernos, "If they ever find the Mutuality, we are fucked no
matter what."
Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah... we got us a big one!"
Lily Kaise laughs.
Vernos says to Melinda, "Yup, that is what I was saying."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "They will find the
Mutuality, eventually."
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, it almost happened sooner rather than later thanks
to Mister ping and Gray."
Eli Grey asks, "Grey?"
Vernos says to Melinda, "I have wondered if making nice with the IFS would help
us with the Jinu."
Melinda Michaels says, "Jonathan Gray."
Eli Grey asks, "Oh jeez that was him that did that?"
Eli Grey groans.
Melinda Michaels nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "Keegan sent the ping, Gray pointed the pod towards
Helios."
Melinda Michaels says, "Deitz ran the trip that took them into outsider space
because he wouldn't ask questions prior to leaving."
Vernos says to Ather, "Do the IFS ever try to communicate outside of just trying
to destroy us on sight?"
Lily Kaise says, "Yup which he denies heh but I observed him do it after he had
been cautioned not to."
Melinda Michaels shrugs. "So it was fucked from the get go."
Eli says to Vernos, "There was a meeting a long time ago to decide if the Lowell
would go for Jinu or IFS first, Jinu won the vote, but there was some very valid
points made about going to the IFS first that I tend to agree with."
Eli Grey says, "Mainly, getting their help in assisting the Jinu, which makes
lots of sense."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Don't much care where
Lowell goes, I just want to be on it. So shiny."

china shop."

on the other hand..."

similarly prone to such behavior."

run around like they're crazy."

Emily Ford looks at Ather Jammoa thoughtfully.
Emily Ford says, "Misunderstood."
Emily Ford nods.
Morris says to Emily, "Oh I thought he meant soft and acidic."
Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew chuckles.
Emily Ford says, "Hey, I've been known to be acidic, so I'm not going to
comment."
Emily Ford starts in on the second half of a roast beef sandwich.
Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We simply cannot recharge
until we find thing worth sending extended observation programmed probe. Even if
we must run out of charge and self-destruct ship for what will be considered
very worse reason ever."
Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly I just try not to upset folks or say stupid shit."
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
Eli Grey smirks at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.
Morris Corlew grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.
Emily says to Vernos, "When do you plan to implement that?"
Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.
Morris looks away and scratches his head.
Eli Grey stands up from a white leather sofa.
Eli Grey roams east.
Vernos says to Emily, "Well the comment I made earlier will hopefully be the
only stupid one I make for a long time."
Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Emily Ford says, "Oh, that one. I'd almost forgotten about that."
Vernos Bailey says, "Me too."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Well worst case we could just stop in the middle of
nowhere and recharge with what we have and probably gain some cycles."
Emily Ford nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
Emily Ford says, "I commented earlier that we've probably got enough in the hold
until we find something."
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings
presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.
Eli Grey roams in from the east.
Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.
Eli Grey takes a bite of a cold ice cream sandwich.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Pre-stellar would work
well enough, is full of things that burns well."
Morris Corlew says, "That, nebula, oort has comets that'll mostly burn pretty
well."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah."
Emily Ford says, "We should have brought along a pair of pilots known to argue
lots as entertainment."
Vernos Bailey says, "I have been fixed on the locations console."
Morris Corlew says, "You've got me and Mel."
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Emily says to Morris, "Ah, carry on then."
Eli Grey says to Emily, "At least ti's entertaining to watch Ailing and Ather
insult each other."
Emily Ford grins.
Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.
Eli Grey says, "Er.. aisling."
Eli Grey says, "Yeah.. that's how you say it."
Eli Grey takes a bite of a cold ice cream sandwich.
Morris says to Emily, "Actually we don't near as much as we used to. I got to
the point I just realize she's right most the time and don't bother anymore."
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Eli Grey grins.
Vernos Bailey says, "I will gladly pick up shovel and throw debris into
furnance."
Eli Grey takes a bite of a cold ice cream sandwich.
Morris Corlew gives Vernos Bailey a thumbs up!
Vernos says to Morris, "Plus I could use the excerise."
Morris Corlew chuckles at Vernos Bailey.
Morris says to Vernos, "Actually, I enjoy shovelin myself."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
Morris Corlew says, "Not myself I mean..."
Morris Corlew says, "Ahem."
Morris Corlew asks, "I myself, enjoy shovelin?"
Vernos Bailey nods.
Eli says to Morris, "I wouldn't normally agree, but it is good when you've been
cooped up in a starship for a few days. Helps to get the blood flowing."
Morris says to Eli, "Yeah, that's what I mean. I do enjoy it."
Emily Ford says, "It's the only chance I have to get hot and sweaty."
Emily Ford frowns.
Eli Grey smirks.
Vernos Bailey says, "Wow."
Eli Grey pats Emily Ford on the back.
Vernos Bailey says, "My mind went straight there."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Emily Ford takes another large bite of a roast beef sandwich.
Vernos says to Morris, "I blame the general communications channel for my
perversions."
A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red
glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
Eli Grey laughs at Vernos Bailey.
Eli Grey takes a bite of a cold ice cream sandwich.
Morris says to Vernos, "So...you're like every pilot in existence almost that
had no impure thoughts ever before becomin a pilot?"
Vernos Bailey says, "No I had them for sure."
Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.
Vernos Bailey says, "They just got worse in space."
Morris Corlew laughs.
Emily looks up from her sandwich and asks in a soft tone, "What are impure
thoughts?"
Morris Corlew looks at Emily Ford thoughtfully.
Morris Corlew looks at Emily Ford and shrugs. "I dunno."
Eli Grey says, "My head was always too m uch in the stars to pay attention to
Melinda's butt shorts before..."
Eli Grey says, "I mean.. uh.."
Morris covers his mouth and laughs.
Eli Grey says, "Um.. women's butt shorts."
Eli Grey coughs.
Morris Corlew says, "Well. Now we know one more pilot has a crush on Melinda."
Morris Corlew grins.
Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself.
Eli Grey finishes off a cold ice cream sandwich.
Eli Grey says, "I didn't say that I just uh.. oh nevermind."
Morris Corlew pats Eli Grey on the back. "I won't tell on ya."
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Emily Ford asks, "Nobody's going to tell me what impure thoughts are then?"
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.
Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly, Luja is pretty good looking."
Emily Ford says, "I'm completely innocent, you see."
Luja blinks.
Eli says to Emily, "I think they might just be regular thoughts for you."
Eli Grey nudges Emily Ford gently.
Vernos Bailey says nothing.
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Vernos Bailey says nothing.
Emily Ford stares at Eli Grey.
Morris says to Eli, "You might be right."
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Luja Garland says, "I heard my name."
Eli shrugs and grins.
Vernos says to Luja, "No one said Luja at all."
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Vernos Bailey.
Emily Ford says, "I need to call up Marvin Cykes and have a case brought against
the blue guy."
Vernos Bailey smirks.
Morris Corlew grins.
Eli Grey says, "Uh.. I'm getting the stare."
Morris Corlew asks, "Marvin Cykes?"
Eli Grey laughs.
Emily says to Eli, "He prosecuted the slavers."
Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Eli Grey nods to Emily Ford.
Eli Grey says, "I know."
Emily Ford says, "I probably don't have a case though."
Emily Ford finishes off the last of a roast beef sandwich.
Morris Corlew says, "Oh yeah."
Emily Ford gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Tegan the small circular
sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.
Eli says to Emily, "What are you gonna sew me for? Gneral Teasing?"
Morris Corlew says, "I knew I recognized the name, but...couldn't think where."
Eli Grey says, "Er.. general teasing."
Vernos says to Luja, "All I said was you look cute."
Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings.
Vernos says to Luja, "If you must know."
Emily says to Eli, "Accusing me of being impure by default. That's so....
something."
Vernos Bailey says, "I had taken an interest in Evenia but I think she is into
someone else honestly."
Eli says to Emily, "As if you weren't one of hte pilots that helped me get over
blushing and spluttering all the time."
Morris Corlew says, "Uh."
Eli Grey grins.
Morris says to Vernos, "Yeah, you could say that."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Emily says to Eli, "I was? Do you recall that time..."
Emily Ford laughs.
Vernos says to Morris, "Hm?"
Morris Corlew shakes his head at Vernos Bailey. "Nothin."
Vernos says to Morris, "Hit me with it straight dude."
Eli Grey raises an eyebrow at Emily Ford.
Emily says to Eli, "Anika dared me to go to that briefing with the Admirals
wearing just my nighty and flight boots. Nobody seemed to notice."
"Made a promise long time ago I intend to keep." Morris Corlew shakes his head.
"Others can tell ya. I ain't gonna do it."
Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.
Vernos Bailey nods.
Eli Grey laughs.
Vernos says to Morris, "I can respect that."
Eli says to Emily, "I do remember that actually."
Emily says to Eli, "Then I met up with you on Invaders command and you noticed
right away."
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
Vernos says to Morris, "You are a good man dude."
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
Emily Ford laughs.
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Morris says to Vernos, "If you think so."
Vernos says to Morris, "Never done me wrong."
The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under
emergency boost.
Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.
Emily Ford says, "I seem to recall it was both Nissi and Anika who pushed me
into doing that."
Emily says to Nissi, "You were a bad influence on me, such an innocent woman at
one time."
Morris says to Emily, "Some look like proper dresses. Was it one of them?"
Eli says to Emily, "I believe I was coming out of my quarters and thinking "Oh,
great, I'm having that random sexy lady pilot dream again""
Eli Grey laughs.
Emily says to Eli, "I don't recall."
Morris says to Emily, "You? Innocent? I need to find a time machine."
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many
tendrils.
Emily Ford stares at Morris Corlew.
Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.
Emily Ford says, "My feelings are gushing blood."
Eli says to Emily, "I'm not sure.. I justremember you were in the docking bay."
Emily Ford nods to Eli Grey.
Emily Ford says, "I was."
Morris Corlew chuckles at Emily Ford. "Just...I've never known ya to be the
innocent type. I'm sure you musta been...just...never saw it. It ain't no
insult, just...it is what it is."
Eli comforts Emily.
Vernos Bailey says, "I should send QE message and say still alive out here."
Emily Ford says, "If I had a time machine, I would have gathered the scraps of
evidence."
Eli says to Emily, "Hey, we wouldn't have you any other way. I never meant to
imply it was a bad thing."
Emily Ford sniffles.
Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Eli Grey and nods to Emily Ford. "Exactly."
Emily says to Eli, "Oh, I'm just playing the victim for effect."
Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly I could not picture any of you any differently
than you ae."
Emily says to Eli, "Just don't tell anyone else."
Morris says to Eli, "She's tryin to still look innocnet."
Morris Corlew grins.
Melinda says to Vernos, "It's better to ask before using someone's quantem
device. Some are more strict with it than others."
Morris says to Vernos, "Folks change."
Vernos says to Melinda, "Oh always."
Morris says to Vernos, "I'm not the same as I used to be."
Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.
Vernos says to Melinda, "I'd never touch it without asking."
Eli Grey snickers.
Emily Ford says, "I've changed. I'm taller than I was when I was a baby, for
example."
Vernos Bailey chuckles at Emily Ford.
Morris says to Emily, "You know what I meant."
Morris Corlew says, "I uh..."
Emily Ford nods to Morris Corlew.
Emily Ford says, "I know."
Emily Ford says, "I'd like to think I've changed."
Morris Corlew says, "Ahem...don't blush as much...and do a bit more thinkin for
myself."
Emily Ford says, "I've got James to thank for a lot of my change."
Emily Ford frowns.
Vernos Bailey says, "I am still adjusting to being a pilot honestly but you guys
have honestly helped a lot."
Emily Ford looks at Vernos Bailey thoughtfully.
Vernos Bailey says, "A bit of knowledge from everyone here was gained I think."
Emily says to Vernos, "You do realize we'll all be mailing you invoices for the
assistance, right?"
Vernos says to Emily, "If you do, you do."
Morris Corlew laughs at Emily Ford.
The ship's reactionless drive whirrs loudly as it changes direction rapidly.
Emily says to Vernos, "And if you don't pay, we send in the fleet."
Morris says to Vernos, "Don't worry. I don't charge."
Vernos Bailey nods to Emily Ford.
Vernos says to Emily, "Deal."
Emily says to Vernos, "He doesn't charge much. He's always leaving words off the
end of his sentences like that."
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.
Emily Ford glances at Morris Corlew.
Vernos Bailey says, "Morris is a walking, talking QE comm."
Vernos Bailey says, "Full short hand."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Minor Change: The comings and goings of AI ships will no longer be evident to
people in lounges.
[MTTS] usfolks: Woo. Less spam.
[MTTS] Ulias: Aww.
Vernos says to Morris, "Not an insult, I promise."
[MTTS] something: Woo, great change.
Morris Corlew chuckles.
Morris says to Vernos, "Didn't take it as such."
Vernos says to Morris, "You just pack in all the info needed without all the
words."
[MTTS] babyboy: Finally! Why, thank you!
[MTTS] Butchulla: That's an awesome change.
[MTTS] Ulias: I personally liked it.
[MTTS] something: I mean it was cool the first 352 times but then.
[MTTS] Ulias: Made everything seem more alive.
Morris says to Vernos, "That's the first time I've been accused of that."
Morris Corlew laughs.
[MTTS] andawn: I also liked it, but I can see why it was changed.
Vernos Bailey laughs.
Morris says to Vernos, "Most folks think I'm wordy and talk too much."
[MTTS] stormrider: Woo.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I'd have been happy with an option to turn on an ignore
feature, but that works too. Thanks hosties!
Vernos Bailey says, "Well I havent known you long enough to think that of you."
Vernos Bailey says, "Yet."
Morris Corlew laughs.
[MTTS] davetaylor: I agree, it's cool at first, and I do like to see the navy
come and go and things like that, but the merchants can be a bit spammy.
Morris says to Vernos, "Most get that impression pretty quick."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
[MTTS] Ulias: Well,  as long as they don't take out the ships themselves, Ilove
how much more alive space feels now compared to what it was before.
[MTTS] babyboy: Heh i'm still seeing it.
Emily says to Morris, "Better than saying nothing."
Emily Ford pats Morris Corlew on the back.
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Vernos Bailey says, "I had an idea for a apartment display case."
[MTTS] ricolachen: Does that include delivery ships such as Tony's?
Emily Ford says, "These expeditions can get pretty quiet, we need talkers to
remind us we're still alive."
Eli noggles.
Vernos Bailey says, "I want to get an image from every expedition I go on and
have them in there or hung on my wall with a plaque or label under it to say
when and where I was."
"Guess so." Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space
parakeet. "Just...ya get the idea folks just want ya to keep your mouth shut
when they start bettin on makin ya speechless."
Morris Corlew shrugs.
Vernos Bailey says, "I could run around the ship naked, that would make everyone
speechless."
[MTTS] Squidmind: Those are AI ships, so yes!
Morris says to Vernos, "Nobody wants to see your dangly bits."
Morris smoothes his shipsuit.
Vernos Bailey says, "You are most likely correct."
Emily Ford looks at Vernos Bailey thoughtfully.
Eli says to Vernos, "If you start running around here, cockflapping, I'm gonna
hide in the ducts until it's all over."
Morris Corlew laughs at Eli Grey.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings
stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

Vernos says to Eli, "I would not put anyone through such horrors unwillingly."
Emily Ford says, "That sometimes does happen with the voting game, however."
Eli Grey says, "Nudger alert? I like it."
Vernos Bailey asks, "Nudger alert?"
Eli Grey laughs at Vernos Bailey.
Emily Ford says, "Yes, we switch the red bulb for a blue one."
Emily Ford nods.

Morris Corlew chuckles.
Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot green tea.
Vernos says to Melinda, "Someone said something about making people speechless,
so I said I know how to make everyone speechless."
Vernos Bailey says, "And offered to streak around the ship."
Melinda says to Vernos, "Ah."
Morris says to Vernos, "Well...if it were me they'd likely scream, so..."
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.
Emily Ford says, "I always thought it should have been said as pink and
wrinklies, you know, those places where wrinkles naturally occur on some
people..."
Eli Grey snickers.
Melinda Michaels grins.
Vernos Bailey asks, "So this is the coversations that occur on expeditons?"
Morris Corlew shakes his head and chuckles.
Morris says to Vernos, "This is nothin."
A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.
Emily Ford says, "However, the voting game could see Vern running around with
his tent pole on show."
Morris Corlew says, "Ahem."
Emily Ford says, "I need a drink... somthing more than coffee to get the images
out of my head."
Emily Ford stands up from a white leather sofa.
Emily Ford slinks east.

questions to ask about all of that."

out?"
Emily Ford takes a sip of a glass of brandy.
Morris Corlew asks, "Keep movin?"
Emily Ford says, "We could sing some songs."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Could sit in engineering
and watch number go down."
Emily says to Pierre-Louis, "That's the best suggestion so far."
Morris Corlew says, "I need to dig the banjo outta storage sometime."

A high-pitched whine fills your senses.
You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.
The stage lights flicker briefly.
The curtains close, to no applause.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
A white bird flashes by over the plain.

A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

[PA] Morris Corlew: "Night Eli."
A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Dooooooomed."
The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.
The ship drifts by a number of bodies lying in a vile, thick slush.
The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the
water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle
impotently.
The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight
with each other.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
The room grows a bit more chill.
You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't

For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

search but for shops.
[MTTS] Ulias: Phone psychics would surely see civilian pilots as perfect marks
heh.
[MTTS] Butchulla: That would be awesome. Specially with inactive pilots and the
books we rely on for that not being available.
[MTTS] Ulias: That'll be a million credits for the first minute and five hundred
thousand each additional minute.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.
A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like
thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air
before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.
You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine
where they are coming from.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

On the shore, a number of bodies are stretched out on burning sand as fire falls
from the sky.
Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.
On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from
scored bark and snapped branches.

on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky
from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains
of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. Lights overhead indicate that

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the
collar and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across
the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant
white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both
wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

Nissi Valdaire says, "That's really the only way it'd work."
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
Morris says to Nissi, "Well, don't get down on yourself. I said go outside and
smoke in your suit..."
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Morris Corlew says, "Potentially just as bad."
Rogue Romano says, "No no, its all good. I'll just have a couple drinks.
Hopefully its takes off the edgy feelin'."
"Nissi I wouldn't take that back!" Lily Kaise grins at Nissi Valdaire. "I agree
with you!"
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise says, "Well airlocking is pretty mean so I wouldn't do that either."
Rogue Romano takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.
Vernos Bailey says, "I am confused."
Morris says to Vernos, "What are you confused about?"
Vernos Bailey says, "Spaced out a moment and come back to talking of airlocking
folks."
Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement
communication device.
Morris says to Vernos, "Just smokers."
Vernos Bailey says, "Last I checked after time near the furnance we all smell
like smokers."
Morris Corlew says, "No no...literal....like cigs and pipes."
Vernos Bailey says, "Oh."
Nissi Valdaire says, "It's a strain on life support, it would directly reduce
our range."
Rogue Romano finishes off a shot of chilled vodka.
Morris Corlew nods.
Rogue Romano gives a shot glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot,
which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.
Morris Corlew eats a spoonful of ice cream from a cold cherry cola float then
stirs the drink, blending the ice cream and beverage together.
Morris Corlew upends a cold cherry cola float and drinks the rest of the creamy
beverage.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings
spins itself around in tight circles.
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its

Eli Grey takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.
Eli says to Nissi, "I wonder if we could put a filtration on a ship for smokers,
like the one they have on Foxxtrot?"
Eli Grey says, "Might take up too much charge."
Eli Grey takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.
Vernos Bailey says, "Maybe we can use the fighter for smokers."
Vernos Bailey says, "L sack."
Vernos Bailey says, "Looking for a good snack I mean."
Morris gestures toward the galley, then at a personal pizza oven.
Morris Corlew says, "Pick your poisin."
Vernos Bailey examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.
Morris Corlew says, "Poison."
A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the
interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from
the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is
heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front
opens and Vernos Bailey removes a small round personal taco pizza from the open
compartment.
Vernos Bailey says, "Taco pizza."
Morris Corlew nods. "Definitely poisonous."
You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night.
Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.
Vernos Bailey says, "No you want poison."
Vernos Bailey says, "Try my family dog's farts."
Vernos Bailey says, "Worse than pierre on beans."
Morris Corlew laughs. "Yes, we had a couple dogs growin up."
Vernos Bailey says, "Gas mask quality dog gas."
Melinda Michaels suddenly awakens.
Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.
Morris says to Vernos, "Yeah, try feedin your family dog some of my pa's
cookin."
Morris Corlew gags.
Rogue Romano says, "I'm goin' to try and nap."
Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor
pillow.
Vernos Bailey says, "No thank you, my dog could melt the face off a person."
Vernos Bailey says, "As is."
Rogue Romano waves.
Morris says to Rogue, "Rest well."
Rogue Romano nods.
Vernos Bailey waves to Rogue Romano.
Morris Corlew chuckles at Vernos Bailey.
Rogue Romano slinks south.
Vernos Bailey says, "He would not need any help."

Vernos Bailey says, "Tell you one thing."
Vernos Bailey says, "Totally off topic."
Vernos Bailey says, "I've noticed its a lot different repairing a ship on it
than when we were repairing it for you guys on the pad. I thought some of that
skill would translate over but not really."
Morris Corlew nods.
Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
Morris Corlew says, "We let the computer do most stuff."
Morris Corlew says, "Sometimes use tools for boosts and stuff, but...again, most
stuff just goes through the computer. No hammering at stuff, even if we feel
like it 'cause we're frustrated..."
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely and grins.
Vernos Bailey says, "Could you picture having to get out there and repairing a
turret yourself."
Morris Corlew says, "Nope, don't wanna neither."
Vernos Bailey says, "During a battle."
Morris Corlew asks, "Exactly. Laser hits the turret you're on?"
Morris Corlew says, "Ouch."
Damien Goss says, "Pretty sure if you got hit with a ship's laser it wouldn't
hurt."
Vernos Bailey says, "You are fixing the FTL drive and a minicannon blast comes
in."
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
Morris says to Damien, "Nope, wouldn't hurt a bit 'cause you'd be vaporized."
Lily Kaise says, "Poof."
Morris Corlew nods.
Vernos Bailey says, "Ground crews would be cleaning the smudge that was you off
the turret."
Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
Vernos Bailey asks, "Could you picture a minicannon blast to tace?"
Vernos Bailey says, "The face I mean."
Morris Corlew says, "Nope. Wouldn't be a face...or a body."
Vernos Bailey says nothing.
Vernos Bailey says, "We see those things hit the hull all the time out here and
it turns the plates white hot."
Morris Corlew says, "Yep."
A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an
orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
Vernos Bailey says, "That is a lot of energy."
Morris Corlew asks, "Can you imagine if somethin went wrong with ship safeties?"
Morris Corlew says, "I mean...folks like Aisling, Pierre, Anfisa...they lived
without those."
Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Aisling the Fox says, "You die."
Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox.
Aisling the Fox says, "Not much to imagine."
Morris says to Aisling, "Kinda is for folks that take their safety for granted."
Anfisa of Marzore says, "Yes, is very simple."
Anfisa of Marzore says, "Is harder to keep air in than to let it out."
Aisling the Fox asks, "Dying is hard to imagine?"
Morris says to Aisling, "Harder when it's not a constant reality."
Aisling the Fox asks, "Regs suddenly do not die often?"
Morris says to Aisling, "Not aboard ships."
Aisling the Fox shrugs.
Anfisa of Marzore says, "Grab airtight bag, put snugly over head. Start
attempting to breathe. Simulation complete."
Aisling the Fox grins at Anfisa of Marzore.
Damien Goss smiles.
Morris Corlew says, "The point was, we take our safety systems for granted.
Folks don't think, 'Hey, I could die on this ship.'"
Anfisa of Marzore says, "Well, yes. That is decadence of regs."
Damien Goss says, "Not all regs."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda
Michaels's shoulder.
Anfisa of Marzore says, "Yes, all regs."
Damien Goss stands up.
Damien Goss says, "Ok you knwo all."
Damien Goss steps south.
Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.
Anfisa of Marzore says, "Well, I know reg ships."
Morris picks at a fingernail.
Aisling the Fox asks, "What is it with people named Damien?"
Vernos Bailey says, "I accept that pods have a nearly perfect and spotless
record but does not mean something could not happen."
Vernos Bailey says, "I accept the possibilty."
"That was my point." Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Vernos Bailey. "In
general, because of the safety record, we don't often think about, what if
somethin went wrong?"
You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night.
Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.
Morris says to Aisling, "Do you ever wonder, when you get aboard Oracle, what if
these systems fail?"
Aisling the Fox says, "I trust ship. I do not trust me."
Morris nods slowly. "But...you do not control the safety mechanisms. So...you're
saying you don't ever wonder, what if this automatic system fails?"
Morris Corlew says, "If you don't, then it's not just 'regs' that have this
decadence."
Morris Corlew says, "I do. I wonder about it. So...Goss is right. It's also not
all 'regs.'"
Aisling says to Morris, "Oracle is not put together by tiny bits of spare parts
cobbled together with what can be found like my old scout was."
Morris says to Aisling, "It can still fail, can't it? Everything has a
possibility of failure. No matter how remote. It's a part of life."
Aisling the Fox says, "Yes, it can."
Morris Corlew says, "Then, is this decadence only a reg thing? Oracle wasn't
even built by regs."

The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship

splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
Aisling says to Morris, "I have lived a very tiny portion of life on a ship
without these securities that Mutuality has provided."
Aisling the Fox says, "With, I mean."
Vernos Bailey says, "What direction are we going'"
Vernos Bailey asks, "Spinward, rimward?"
Aisling the Fox says, "And Mutuality is significantly tiny portion of
unregistered peoples."
Morris says to Aisling, "And that means that we are not allowed to understand
what it's like? That we can't 'get it' without having done it? That we can't
wonder if maybe one day ours would fail?"
Aisling the Fox says, "It is not quite the same."
Aisling the Fox asks, "Have you known someone who has died in starship?"
Vernos Bailey says, "S."

Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather
sofa, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver

The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into
quickly evaporating smoke.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.
The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship

to avoid them!

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A dwarf star is here, a point of light with an apparent size not much bigger
than far more distant stars. Only its greater brightness indicates its
proximity.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.
The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.
The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.
The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.
A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in.
As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.
A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.
Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing
on the hull.
The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the
collar. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant
white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both
wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship
is back in the riftflow.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple
cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki
canvas sneakers, a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies
across the toes, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

Final total: 20 pilots.
On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from
scored bark and snapped branches.
The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight
with each other.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares
into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive
squid propels itself away from the starship.
Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that
even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.
The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship
is back in the riftflow.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
