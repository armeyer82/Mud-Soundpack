Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
Akemi Bando says into the PA microphone, "That storm is moving away from us, and
so is not desirable for us to try to catch. Even if it weren't an energetic
storm."

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure
xenology storage container, a small blue bioplastic ship light (casting a soft
blue glow), a dark brown leather captain's chair, a small square dark brown
rattan table with a glass top, an interdictor launcher, Nestor the humanoid
service robot, a cardboard box labeled 'Here be keys', an orange plastic box
labeled 'Felo Chow', a soft square dark blue rug with a luxuriously deep pile
and thick gold fringe, a metal container, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding
trough, a small natural golden brown trash bin, and Magellan the arachnoid
security robot here.

You peer south...
[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Main Deck; Fore]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. The base of the jib mast is bolted to the deck here, the mast extending
upward straight through the hull and outside the ship. A small set of sail
controls is nearby. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a
seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long counter with a blue and gold marble laminate top edged with
grooved chrome, a soft square light blue rug with a luxuriously deep pile and
thick gold fringe, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a glossy silver ceramic
felo chow bowl, a small bubbling white-lit aquarium, and Nekomata the
medium-sized blue twin tailed felo here.
You can go north, south, and down.
