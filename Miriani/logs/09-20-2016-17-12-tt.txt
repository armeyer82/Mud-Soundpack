-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Room 301; Love Suite]
The royal blue carpeting and light blue walls continue into the sleeping area,
where a large heart-shaped bed awaits, covered in a velvet red blanket and crisp
white sheets. A bubbled window is mounted into the wall, allowing an expansive
view of deep space. There appears to be a mirror on the ceiling.
You see a large heart-shaped bed with a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made pink and dark pink dragon quilt on it, a
small dark faux wood desk, a small dark faux wood chair, a mirror covering one
wall, a pair of gray canvas sneakers, a crisp coral pink cotton shirt with
puffed sleeves, a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued
on the front, a pair of body-skimming white lowrise capri jeans with periwinkle
blue and coral pink jeweled flowers on the front and back pockets, a pair of
relaxed fit light khaki cargo pants, a pair of very brief ivory cotton panties
with a row of tiny embroidered flowers in the front, a soft ivory cotton bra
embroidered with tiny flowers, a pair of sparkly white leather clogs, and a pair
of white cotton briefs here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a large heart-shaped bed.
You can go north, northeast, and west.
(You are lying on a large heart-shaped bed with a large periwinkle bed pillow, a

answer. I think we need to do shorter, more frequent trips, that at least show

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well we have had
embarrassments on the part of certain AEU pilots such as when Jonathan Gray
decided to switch the direction of the escape pod from the Fringe sponsored
failed Marlena Darby espedition. He changed the course of the escape pod to
Helios when Outsiders could have followed us into Mutuality Territories.
Otherwise, we've not really failed in terms of exploration. We simply don't have
a larger AEU developed exploration ship which can accomodate more than two crew
members to use for exploration. So we have to rely upon other means. We have the
Magnitor but so far unless an aEU pilot is able to make a new discovery, it's
out of our reach."

is inside the riftflow.

This is a report detailing the events which occurred during the early morning of
September 19, 2316.
At approximately 06:35, there was  a call over the general communication channel
by Lily Kaise about a pirate destroyer in Belt of Orion. I was asteroid mining
in Belt of Crias at the time, and immediately flew to Old Earth to board my
fighter, "Shadowblade." As I landed at Earth, Blake Madison reported an Outsider
in sector as well as the pirate.
Once in Belt of Orion, I did a scan to see the ships that were in space. The
results of the initial scan are as follows:
Braxton Schroeder.......................ASS-C1 Allied Starships Destroyer
Kamikaze................................CFY-39-III Coalition Space Superiority
Fighter Mk III
Corvette Omega 99.......................Outsider Battle Thrall Chochle-class
Corvette
Kamikaze is the name of Mr. madison's fighter, as I soon learned when I was
requested to create a communications link with it. The destroyer is the pirate
destroyer mentioned earlier. Blake and I decided to observe the corvette and
destroyer fighting, as the two ships were already in combat when I entered the
sector. Morris Corlew was in the rift at the time, attempting to understand what
was happening from the reports being given over the general and tactical
communications channels. It was he who first brought up the possibility of
communicating via the thrall translation program sold on the Accord of Free
Worlds Command station. I jumped out of the sector and asked the technicians
there to quickly install the translation upgrade, then jumped back to the
engagement site. As I was jumping back in, Keegan Wantz identified the race of
the thralls in question, since nobody knew the corvette designation. He called
them turtles.
When I returned, the pirate destroyer was gone. I do not know if the ship was
destroyed or fled, but the corvette began to lock and fire on me as I was
attempting to communicate with it. Mr. Madison asked me if we should engage, and
I advised to hold off and let me try a few more times to talk to it. After
attempting communications for about five minutes and allowing it to land a few
shots and trying friendly communications, I sent a warning at it to surrender or
I would attack. When it did not respond, I shot it one time with a round of
chaingun fire. The actions of the enemy ship did not change, so I gave the order
to attack.
Just before the fighting began, Akemi Bando entered the sector in her fighter,
"Odokuro" and, mistaking where the engagement was taking place, entered the rift
on a course for a nearby asteroid field. She realized her mistake and turned
around as soon as possible. By the time she returned, Mr. Madison and I had well
and truly engaged the corvette and had damaged it enough so it could not use its
wormhole drive, according to our scans. A transcription of a scan of the ship is
as follows:
Outsider Battle Thrall Chochle-class Corvette "Corvette Omega 99"
--
IFF Transponder Code: Outsider Thrall
Model Designation: THRALL-SAMEKH
Hull damage: 0%
Average damage: 60%
Occupancy: Filled
FTL Capable: No
Weapons: Powered up
Power: Charged
Cargo: Ammunition
Coordinates: (14, 7, 14)
Distance: 1
--
Ms. Bando attempted her own communications with the corvette upon her return to
the engagement site, but met with the same lack of success we did. We noticed we
could not damage the ship beyond this point, so Ms. Bando had the idea to try
and use bolts, launched by her bolt thrower "Boneyard" and, along the way,
picked up Melinda Michaels as a crew member. After that attempt failed, they
decided to see if they could get battlesuits inside the ship to disable it from
within. After a few minutes, that worked and a patrol of Peacekeepers, who had
entered the sector while Ms. Bando and Ms. Michaels were aboard the corvette,
finished it off in short order.
It is worth mentioning that Mr. Corlew, who for this entire situation was in the
rift, reported experiencing the common rift hallucination of being attacked by
the Outsider mothership as soon as it was reported there was an Outsider thrall
in Belt of Orion, and was released from this hallucination as soon as the
corvette was destroyed by the two Peacekeeper ships. It is also worth mentioning
that "Peacekeeper Task Force Psi 0" and "Peacekeeper Task Force Lambda 4" were
very quick to destroy the corvette, responding with wonderful swiftness when
they came across our fight. I would like my thanks to be communicated to the
Accord, and to the crew of those two ships in particular, for their help.
If you have any other questions for me, I would be more than happy to answer
them.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

20-01 20 September 2316 GST From the Liaison.............................Hello.
Ms. Kaise, the New Earth News is requesting a statement from the Voice of the
Corps regarding the issue of the corps. In case you are unfamiliar, this refers
to President Garner's recent publicizing of his plan to create a new branch of
the navy he calls the Expeditionary Force, which is likely to accelerate the
winding down of the AEU's civilian pilot program. Mr. Best has stated his
opposition to this and his intention to reopen the corps to new applicants,
while Ms. Rebane has offered no comment and seems to have no plans one way or
the other. The NEN wishes to ascertain the corps' feelings on this matter, and
specifically the feelings of its representative, the Voice. Is there a statement
you would like to make?

sector. Morris Corlew was in the rift at the time, attempting to understand what
was happening from the reports being given over the general and tactical
communications channels. It was he who first brought up the possibility of
communicating via the thrall translation program sold on the Accord of Free
Worlds Command station. I jumped out of the sector and asked the technicians
there to quickly install the translation upgrade, then jumped back to the
engagement site. As I was jumping back in, Keegan Wantz identified the race of
the thralls in question, since nobody knew the corvette designation. He called
them turtles.
When I returned, the pirate destroyer was gone. I do not know if the ship was
destroyed or fled, but the corvette began to lock and fire on me as I was
attempting to communicate with it. Mr. Madison asked me if we should engage, and
I advised to hold off and let me try a few more times to talk to it. After
attempting communications for about five minutes and allowing it to land a few
shots and trying friendly communications, I sent a warning at it to surrender or
I would attack. When it did not respond, I shot it one time with a round of
chaingun fire. The actions of the enemy ship did not change, so I gave the order
to attack.
Just before the fighting began, Akemi Bando entered the sector in her fighter,
"Odokuro" and, mistaking where the engagement was taking place, entered the rift
on a course for a nearby asteroid field. She realized her mistake and turned
around as soon as possible. By the time she returned, Mr. Madison and I had well
and truly engaged the corvette and had damaged it enough so it could not use its
wormhole drive, according to our scans. A transcription of a scan of the ship is
as follows:
Outsider Battle Thrall Chochle-class Corvette "Corvette Omega 99"
--
IFF Transponder Code: Outsider Thrall
Model Designation: THRALL-SAMEKH
Hull damage: 0%
Average damage: 60%
Occupancy: Filled
FTL Capable: No
Weapons: Powered up
Power: Charged
Cargo: Ammunition
Coordinates: (14, 7, 14)
Distance: 1
--
Ms. Bando attempted her own communications with the corvette upon her return to
the engagement site, but met with the same lack of success we did. We noticed we
could not damage the ship beyond this point, so Ms. Bando had the idea to try
and use bolts, launched by her bolt thrower "Boneyard" and, along the way,
picked up Melinda Michaels as a crew member. After that attempt failed, they
decided to see if they could get battlesuits inside the ship to disable it from
within. After a few minutes, that worked and a patrol of Peacekeepers, who had
entered the sector while Ms. Bando and Ms. Michaels were aboard the corvette,
finished it off in short order.
It is worth mentioning that Mr. Corlew, who for this entire situation was in the
rift, reported experiencing the common rift hallucination of being attacked by
the Outsider mothership as soon as it was reported there was an Outsider thrall
in Belt of Orion, and was released from this hallucination as soon as the
corvette was destroyed by the two Peacekeeper ships. It is also worth mentioning
that "Peacekeeper Task Force Psi 0" and "Peacekeeper Task Force Lambda 4" were
very quick to destroy the corvette, responding with wonderful swiftness when
they came across our fight. I would like my thanks to be communicated to the
Accord, and to the crew of those two ships in particular, for their help.
If you have any other questions for me, I would be more than happy to answer
them.
