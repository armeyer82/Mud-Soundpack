Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid
service robot, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a blue plastic food
storage container, a compact red refrigerator, a small blue insulated cooler,
and a clear plastic food storage container here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.

a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. Its stomach is bulging, but it
seems content to slowly digest its large meal.

New Phoenix's shopping district begins here, at the edge of China Road. Shops
and stores thrive, though often with reduced inventories due to the interruption
in trade caused by the war. Carts and tented merchants line the sidewalks, and
people mill about, searching for the perfect buy. Off to one side is The Silk
Worm, a fashionable ladies' department store. You also see a Chinese buffet bar
called the Golden Dragon, on the other side of the street. You can barely make

Several shops selling to upscale customers have moved into the renovated
buildings here. Palm trees have been planted along the median, and brand new
awnings shade every doorway. Beneath a bright green awning on the first floor of
a stylishly renovated brick building here is Alonzo's Fresh Hair Design. Nearby
is a set of steps leading down below ground level. A small sign above the steps

Ancient office buildings dominate this block. Though many of them bear signs of
having fallen into disrepair in the past, in their worn and dirty brick facades
and crumbling ornamental designs, New Phoenix's businesses displaced by the war
have begun moving in, rejuvenating the entire area. New offices now occupy the
old buildings, and even though outward repairs have begun only slowly, the area
already has a bustling atmosphere. A leveled building has been replaced with a
small plaza. A small hair care shop has recently opened here.

Though not completely restored, the old office buildings along this part of
Japan Boulevard are already home to new businesses. Two new shops are directly
next to each other in the same building: 'Freneza,' which has in its front
windows displays of hosiery, belts, and odd-looking bracelets; and 'Studdedly,'
which occupies the corner of the building and advertises with hand-made signs
its low-priced stock of wrist bands and chokers. A number of glum and edgy
people seem to hang around these shops, their spiked hair and unique dress
setting them apart from the usual shoppers.

rejuvenating the entire area. On the south side of the street here, a new
furniture store displays beautiful arrangements of graceful rattan furniture
through its sparkling clean glass windows; over the entrance is the name
'Rattania' spelled out in burnished brass letters.

This block of Japan Boulevard has recently begun a commercial rejuvenation.
Where it was somewhat rundown before the war, the infusion of money from private
businesses has brought a new atmosphere of bustle and success to the area. On
the lower floor of a brick building on the northern side of the street, a
delightful-looking breakfast restaurant with a large plate glass window in the
front has just opened. 'Colt's Kitchen and Catering' is painted across the
window in cheerful red letters. The Boulevard continues both to the east and

Japan Boulevard extends both east and west from here, filling the area with the
sounds, smells, and sights of commerce. Tall office buildings rise over the
street, framed by evenly spaced streetlamps. To the west, looming over the
street, are numerous tall buildings covered with scaffolding. Day by day, new
and beautifully architectured parts of the older buildings emerge as the
revitalization of Japan Boulevard proceeds. The latest of these is a divine
formal shop called 'The White Tie Affair,' where elegantly posed mannequins in
ball gowns and tailcoats grace the store's tall display windows. Across the
street is an exclusive jewelry store with an elegant sign beside the entrance,
reading: 'Bonita.'

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Chainguns are components one does not often expect to find on an AEU ship. They
don't hurt the combat grid too badly, and some of them have higher hull bonuses
than any other weapons, but they do have their downsides. Chainguns require
ammunition, and time to reload when the turrets run dry. This will mean you
cannot fire for a certain period of time. Also, without bonuses they do not hit
as hard as the other weapons available to us which means you will likely be
stuck in a battle for a longer time than you might want.

Lasers are most often an AEU pilot's favorite weapon. This is mostly due to the
fact that most AEU ships get nice bonuses for our laser turrets, which makes
using them more worthwhile than using something like chainguns. In some
instances, the lasers also get a really good hull bonus which make them more
useful than heavy launchers if you have a strong enough laser upgrade. The
downside to using lasers however, is that they really drain the combat grid. So
you'll want to find a laser turret that has a good balance between damage, hull
bonus and combat energy grid. There is also a time issue, too. Some of the
heavier lasers pack a nice punch, but have a five second firing time. This could
theoretically hamper your ability to destroy ships in a timely manner. Note: the
potential damage points information in the above stats do not reflect the
additional bonus damage points available in some AEU ships.

Chainguns are components one does not often expect to find on an AEU ship. They
don't hurt the combat grid too badly, and some of them have higher hull bonuses
than any other weapons, but they do have their downsides. Chainguns require
ammunition, and time to reload when the turrets run dry. This will mean you
cannot fire for a certain period of time. Also, without bonuses they do not hit
as hard as the other weapons available to us which means you will likely be
stuck in a battle for a longer time than you might want.

Two-person Combat ships:
Two-Person Combat Scout 30,000,000.00 (New Earth allied technologies)
AY-104 AEU COMBAT SCOUT
Requirements: 500 industry points       500 combat points
Model number: AY-104                    Designation: Combat Scout
Turret hardpoints: 7                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 4000         Standard battery hours: 8
Docking bay size required: 12.5
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 110%
The combat scout is one of the best small combat ships for the AEU. It's very
well armed and offers good laser bonuses. It also adds the further benefit of an
extra hull failsafe over the regular two-person scout.
Two-Person Bolt Thrower 132,000,000.00 (Endymion Revo Technologies)
RDT-E2M5 REVO DEVELOPMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES BOLT THROWER
Class: Corvette
Requirements: 450 industry points       650 combat points
Model number: RDT-E2M5                  Designation: Bolt Thrower
Turret hardpoints: 5                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 24000        Standard battery hours: 10
Docking bay size required: 26
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 120%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
The Bolt Thrower is a corvette-class starship. This ship has weapons in both the
control room and the weapons room, and has the added advantage of a
pre-installed bolt cannon. Hence, the big price tag.
Two-Person Flare (approval required) (Aenea)
AW-2 AEU FLARE-CLASS TWIN-ASSAULT VESSEL
Class: Corvette
Requirements: 2000 industry points      2500 combat points
Model number: AW-2                      Designation: Flare
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 500          Standard battery hours: 10
Docking bay size required: 20
   Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 120%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
This is a very nice new AEU combat vessel. It has six laser turrets in each room
(the control room and the weapon room) and a nice, 35% laser bonus. However, you
will have to fill out an application if you ever want to own one, then wait to
see whether or not you will get approved to own it. Approval or denial
notifications can take from a few days up to a couple weeks. You will be
notified by mail either way.
Lily says, "So now it's 2320ish and then at 11:20ish."

Gunships and the Pincer:
Five-Person Gunship 65,000,000.00 (New Earth Blazing Trails)
AM-9X AEU STAR-CLASS GUNSHIP
Requirements: 250 industry points       100 combat points
Model number: AM-9X                     Designation: Gunship
Turret hardpoints: 15                   Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 32000        Standard battery hours: 24
Docking bay size required: 60           Docking bay capacity: 25
Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 95%
The AM-9X is the first-tier gunship of the AEU. It is a good starter ship for
someone looking to become more experienced with flying larger and more dangerous
decoy beacon drops without facing some of the more challenging vessels they are
likely to encounter using bigger or more heavily armed ships.
Five-Person Pulsar 100,000,000.00 (Endymion)
AR-7C AEU PULSAR-CLASS ASSAULT GUNSHIP
Requirements: 1250 industry points      1250 combat points
Model number: AR-7C                     Designation: Pulsar
Turret hardpoints: 20                   Launcher hardpoints: 3
Standard storage capacity: 35000        Standard battery hours: 16
Docking bay size required: 65           Docking bay capacity: 25
Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 95%
While this ship has less charge than the AM-9X gunship, it's also considerably
better armed, being outfitted with five additional turrets and 2 additional
launchers. The pulsar can hold its own against even cruiser-class ships if it
has to, and its hull (if you look at the status readouts) is stronger than that
of the AM-9X.
Six-Person Pincer (approval required) (Telex Defense Incorporated)
T6-09 TELEX DEFENSE INC. PINCER-CLASS FORWARD ASSAULT FRIGATE
Requirements: 1500 industry points      1500 combat points
Model number: T6-09                     Designation: Pincer
Turret hardpoints: 17                   Launcher hardpoints: 6
Standard storage capacity: 30000        Standard battery hours: 12
Docking bay size required: 100          Docking bay capacity: 37.5
   Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 95%
Ever wanted your own frigate to do six-person combat activities with? Well, the
pincer is your answer to this problem! However, you will have to fill out an
application for it, and it can take some time for you to know whether or not you
got aproved to buy the ship. You will be notified by mail regardless.

awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a

[Starship "Capricious"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a wormhole drive tracer here.

You see a viral injection pylon launcher and a decoy beacon launcher here.
Blake Madison is standing here.
You can go south and out.
Cesar Ysidro says to Akemi Bando, "They gave me a medal for that."
Blake Madison says in a Candelarian accent, "Nobody move."
Blake Madison grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly
away from him.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
Blake Madison uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Wolf Pack, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
Cesar Ysidro sits down.

Cesar Ysidro says in a Chetumal City accent, "I have moved."
Blake Madison presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.
Akemi Bando stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

You grin at Lily Kaise.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
Cesar says, "You have no power over me Blake Madison."
Lily Kaise grins at you.
Evenia Callseah stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
Blake says to Cesar, "But...but...why!"
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Blake Madison presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Two).
Cesar Ysidro stands up.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Wolf Pack. Welcome to Accord space."
Rogue Romano grins.

"How can you be a proper captain without a captain's chair," Cesar says.
You notice Blake Madison using the radio to ask for docking clearance.
Rogue nods.
A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free
Worlds port."
Blake says to Cesar, "Halp."
Blake says, "I do not have chairs."
Cesar says, "Fucking amateur hour here."
Blake says, "Everyone up."
Cesar Ysidro pets Blake Madison on the head.
Lily laughs.
Akemi Bando stands up.

Cesar Ysidro pulls Evenia Callseah towards him.

[Starship "Wolf Pack"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Two.
You see a viral injection pylon launcher and a decoy beacon launcher here.
Blake Madison, Lily Kaise, Akemi Bando, Cesar Ysidro, Zandria Marschaund, Rogue

Blake says, "Some one has done missions."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not me."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Uh oh."

Cesar says, "Probably someone with pending SVP."
"Anyone done any sVP or salvageing missions?" Lily asks.
Akemi asks, "Did someone do some Space Vermin Patrol missions or something?"
"Whatever," says Cesar, "do this first one and come back."
Blake nods to Cesar.
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "I did."

[Starship "Wolf Pack"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a viral injection pylon launcher and a decoy beacon launcher here.

cup of hot black tea. As other people pass by, an elderly woman seated next to a
small cart points to her menu board, which contains only one item: hot black
tea. The enticing aroma of freshly cooked food wafts into the corridor from a

The south node of the original station is a relatively spacious area, though the
lights in the walls flicker unsteadily, occasionally going out altogether and
leaving everything in darkness for long, interesting moments. Three modules have
been attached to the outside curve of the node, the welded connections bulky and
overdone but nonetheless strong and airtight, judging from the thin layer of
oily dust settled onto the hard, uneven surfaces. To the east and west are wide,
curving corridors with crates set out along them. A straight passageway leads
north toward the center of the station where the light is brighter.

through a few of them before disappearing back into the dented bulkhead. Raw
welds criss-cross the metal along the borders of makeshift patches, lending the
station an ugly, unfinished look. Just to the east, the sounds of voices and

The domed ceiling of this bustling chamber is dotted with several floodlights,
bathing the area in an intense, artificial glow. Hatches leading in all
directions line the circular room, most constantly wedged open. Several dozen
people clad in dark red and black shipsuits mill about, chatting and lingering
among others dressed in grey or red coveralls. The room is uncomfortably stuffy
and poorly ventilated for such a large space, and only a few of the air vents
seem operational. A ladder bolted to one wall leads to a circular door far above
your head, and a particularly wide hatch leads to the southern corridor.

dented, exposed wiring lashed high above on the ceiling, and raw welds mark the

This corridor seems to be much more well-kept than the others on the station,
though coiled wiring stretches overhead in snakelike bundles. The walls are a
mishmash of steel, plasteel, and other building materials, patched so many times
that it is difficult to tell its initial composition. In comparison to the main

This corridor seems to be much more well-kept than the others on the station,
though coiled wiring stretches overhead in snakelike bundles. The walls are a

Clean, if not polished, this corridor is all wires and bare metal. Cables and
clusters of tubes sprout from the bulkhead at seemingly random intervals, some
only briefly appearing before sinking again into another surface while others
bloom into nets of plastic-sheathed tendrils that hang overhead. People of all
size and description, their clothing as patched and worn as the passage wander
here and there; spacesuit boots clattering with their passage more often than
not. Regularly placed along either side of the tunnel are many mismatched
airlocks, some open, the sound of inhabitation spilling out, while most are

Illumination strips cast sufficient light onto the battered metal walls and

some sort. A few plaques in various languages are bolted onto the face of the
door, reading "AUTHORIZED PEOPLES ONLY" in bold block letters. It gets much
darker toward the east, while the faint chatter of daily life emanates from the
north.

The corridor dips outward into a moderately-sized alcove here, taking up the
whole southern wall. Wide viewports give a glimpse of space, and a collection of
starmaps and monitors shine down from overhead. A few busy-looking spacers watch
the displays or stare out into the darkness, speaking into radios frequently and
toggling switches or typing things into keypads. A sign on the wall reveals this
to be a branch of the flight control on this station, responsible for keeping
track of the docking and undocking of the many ships around the busy trading
port.

The steel walls of this corridor are relatively intact, with only the occasional
patch; even those have been painted over carefully, giving this part of a
station a much less cobbled-together feel. Though the carpet underfoot is tough
and worn, it muffles footsteps better than the bare metal in the rest of
structure. Here and there a hatch is recessed into the wall, plaques identifying
them as 'Hydroponics' and 'Transport', though they seem to be locked. The
corridor continues to the north and south, illuminated by long glowing strips
set into the ceiling.

This corridor looks to be the most well-maintained in the whole station, though
that isn't saying much. The hard red carpet underfoot is a change from the bare
metal flooring everywhere else, and the hatches are much more spread out, with
each bearing an official-looking plaque. Despite its size, it is not as crowded
as the commercial district, though the people move up and down it with dutiful
haste. A tall, bony man blocks the largest hatch here, next to a sign bearing
the word 'Shipping'.

It seems like the majority of the traffic entering and exiting this wide
corridor are stopping at the hatch cut into the wall. The signs set above it
make it apparent just why, proclaiming 'COMPONENT ORDERS' in bold letters.
Various people file in and out of the continuously-open doorway, either to
supervise the installation of their purchase or to do the installing. The crowd
is so packed that it is hard to maneuver through, most of the traffic just
pushing through as they head down the corridor north or south.

corridor seems to be relatively intact, with only a few patches made from
similar material scattered here and there along its surface. Though, all said,
with all the paint slapped on it, it could be hard to tell just what the walls
were made of. Giant advertisements have been painted all along the bulkhead,
offering great deals and low prices. Fresher paint overlaps the old in an
extremely disorganized fashion, making it all resemble graffiti more than
anything.

of a massive cruiser-sized ship. The corridor, with walls of bare,
temporary-looking plasteel, leads upward to the west at a rather steep incline,
though the rubber-striated carpeting beneath your feet gives a decent enough
grip. The tone of the conversation is impatient, the quarters uncomfortably

Down this long, curving section of the outring, girders protrude from the walls
at regular intervals, the lengths of polished metal matching the curvature of
the walls and meeting perhaps six meters overhead in a semicircular wheel-like
brace. Between the girders are alcoves containing doorways marked as various
station offices. One of the doorways here has a metal sign bolted to it,
reading, 'Personnel,' and some of the traffic in this area consists of station
workers coming to read the notices mounted to a board beside the doorway.

About ten meters across and twice as long to the north and south, this section
of smoothly finished gray corridor curves slightly as part of the outer ring of
the station, commonly called the Outring. Polished metal girders protrude from
the walls, which arch gradually to meet overhead. Though the light here is never
bright, the tall glowing panels recessed into the walls provide a steady
illumination. On the east side of this area is a wide, open hatch leading into a
spacious corridor extending toward the center of the station. Smaller hatches
follow the outring around the station to the north and south, and the sounds of
ships landing and launching often comes from the corridor leading west from
here. In one corner of the intersection, a narrow circular set of stairs leads
down to a lower level.

that usually uses less than 100 power at almost all times. Heck, if you want,
start building it somewhere where there's a star and just let it run."

chamber are you just hoping to combine both into a single station?"

enough for an unmanned pickup module."

couple more days lifespan."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Those big blast chambers last 20
days, same as the small ones."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "They just burn their fuel
faster."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "From what I see almost all the
time, the salvage processor usually gets a lot of activity throughout the day,
especially if there are no expeditions running. I suppose it will just depend on
whether or not people like having a slightly reduced income since generally a
portion of all salvage almost always goes into the station's power reserves. As
always, I will be delightfully indifferent!"

than any other weapons, but they do have their downsides. Chainguns require
ammunition, and time to reload when the turrets run dry. This will mean you
cannot fire for a certain period of time. Also, without bonuses they do not hit
as hard as the other weapons available to us which means you will likely be
stuck in a battle for a longer time than you might want.

A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting.
The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to
Sol's.
Via general sector communication, Endymion transmits, "Hello there, Revenge!
Welcome to home space!"

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
P:df1Sv[j$rkI)sV2RGsumVG%`a3S.IIIt|8.s1Y
The computer reports that the two-person isotope "The Secrets Of The Stars" has
jumped into the sector.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The computer reports that the two-person isotope "The Secrets Of The Stars" has
jumped into the sector.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a
brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She is wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee appliqued with small neon pink
dragonflies, a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans, and a pair of sparkly
white leather clogs.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left
uncovered.
She is carrying a pair of heavily bejeweled purple earmuffs in her right hand.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a blue plastic food
storage container, a compact red refrigerator, a small blue insulated cooler, a

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee

l anaconda
the eight-person soothsayer mark two "Anaconda"
You see a cruiser here.
"Anaconda" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AH-12b" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is gleaming and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in silver. The bays of its
minicannon launchers are oiled to perfection and painted silver. Its landing
struts are flawless and strong and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a silver AEU logo forward on the starboard side, a geodesic radome, a
smooth dome, and a single large port covered by an iris-style hatch on the
forward end, and the hull has an odd sheen to it, as if covered in a thin
gossamer webbing.

"I'd rather just toss it out if I don't want it," Lily says.

show where you feed Skipper weird candy-coated stuff."

You say, "Me too."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa chortles.
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I'd watch that."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The problem with that is he'd
eventually be full, so I have to find like, the top seven weird things."
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "Should you not be at

multiple trips, so you may resume the whining."
"You have to send it away to this guy," Lily says. "I forgot his name and I

the grave at present!"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It's not, as far as I know."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No as felo only eat when they are
hungry but if you don't have food available for them, yeah they will starve."
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "I have two."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't you think I'd have called
you if I could!? I need parts too."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "This answer is unacceptable."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thanks Akemi. It's still
alive, by the way."

battlesuits require ammunition."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Use Paladin, burn everything."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Drop a mule out there?"
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "So go out in mule."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Just hurl insults."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My goal is to break that
record. Not sure if I could do it with real felo, but you entrusted me with this
thing, so..."
Lily asks, "Yeah guess we'll have to go to GMG when we're back?"
'Yeah, unfortunately.
You say, "Yeah, unfortunately."
Lily says, "It's ok."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "You've got, what, five months
left to go before you break the record Morris?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I suppose Cesar's mule is a
worthy enough sacrifice if he is willing to go through with this plan alongside
me."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Pretty sure a battlesuit won't
transfer between ships in a temp station."
Lily says, "I was stupid enough to cap my exploration and nothing but a very
small amount of ground would count so I'd rather wait so it's ok."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It will not, I've tried."

A short violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its

microdrones, and sonics. Stay out at the grave forever."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Until you get a concussion,
anyway."
Lily says, "I could always swap out for lasers but the chainguns with an ammo
cap would probably work pretty well."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You're moving to the grave?
Let us celebrate."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.

Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good more stuffs!"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Looking for the containers
is easier."
"It is but I like the supplies," Lily says.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "That's interesting. Usually we
blow through them as fast as we can, when it's her and I."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I concur."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "She use to make me go
belowdecks all the time."
"Ifever we want to do that," says Lily, "we can smash up a lot of stations but
we'd miss out I think."
Lily says, "We can try that sometime."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We are agreeing far to much
Ather. Fix this error."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Haven't been at the grave with
her in years, though. Perhaps she has adjusted to the superior way of grave
robbing."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then again, it is entirely
possible that it was not even her. I have had so many glyphmaker partners that
they all tend to blur together."
Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "Ok we have about an hour lefr if we're

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She is wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee appliqued with small neon pink
dragonflies, a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans, and a pair of sparkly
white leather clogs.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left

[Starship "The Shame Squad Prevails"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is

lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "The Shame Squad Prevails"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

[Starship "The Shame Squad Prevails"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a black leather
captain's chair here.

"William Dove" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "ASS-E7" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is faded and slightly scorched and painted a white color with gunmetal
grey trim. Its laser turrets are somewhat scorched and outlined in gunmetal
grey. Its landing struts are rusted and slightly uneven and painted gunmetal
grey.
It has a small shiny black circular section, a series of delicate antennae
encased in a transparisteel dome, and a smooth dome on the forward end.
