The bar is one of the loudest parts of the saloon with the mixture of loud banter and laughter from the many patrons. A long bar stretches along the southern side of the room behind which bartenders can be seen making drinks to order. Several tall bar tables dot the area for patrons to sit and enjoy themselves. Couples dash off and on the dance floor to the north while patrons can be seen going and coming from the gaming tables to the west. A wooden door leads outward to the outside deck while the entryway lies back to the northeast.

There is currently no host. No game can begin until a host arrives.
Nobody is playing.

You can go south.

22:04 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, a red spacesuit navigational computer, a red leather artifact storage container, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, and a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain.

22:04 You are carrying nothing.

22:04 I don't understand that.

22:04 You can't go that way.

22:04 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

22:04 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:04 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

22:04 The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."

22:04 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

22:04 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:04 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

22:04 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

22:05 #$#soundpack_lag 106

22:05 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:05 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:05 You're already buckled in.

22:05 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:05 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:05 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

22:05 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:05 The eight-person gunship "Light of The Autumn Stars" has jumped into the sector.

22:05 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 9, 8."

22:05 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:05 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:05 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:05 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:05 Would you like to request landing clearance at Rolukssica?
[Enter "yes" or "no"]

22:05 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

22:05 [1] High Guard Command

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:05 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

22:05 Space.

22:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

22:05 You peer out and see...

22:05 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.

22:08 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

22:08 #$#soundpack_pong

22:08 #$#soundpack_lag 106

22:08 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:08 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

22:08 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

22:08 Elijah Blackburn's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "wr1"

22:08 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

22:08 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

22:08 [Short-range Communication] Allen Robinson transmits, "Bay for mods?"

22:08 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

22:08 [Short-range Communication] Jack West transmits, "We are full, sorry."

22:08 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

22:08 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

22:08 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

22:08 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

22:08 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

22:09 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.
