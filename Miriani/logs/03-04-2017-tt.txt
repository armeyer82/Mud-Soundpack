You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings pilots! First, a brief mention
of the vessel "Starseekers Defender" which fell to Outsiders a few days ago,
which gives me an excuse to remind you all to be more careful! Keep doing beacon
drops, keep flying against other bad enemies like IFS and Pirates, but be
careful! I sent this notice though, to encourage you all to be increasingly
vigilant. I've been hearing reports that IFS activity has been steadily
increasing the last few weeks, and I destroyed an Ares myself over beacon B-24 a
few minutes before this notice went out. If they hold true to pattern, this
could be the signal of an upcoming multi-sector and multi-alliance invasion.
That invasion might not be today, or tomorrow, but it will probably be within
the next few weeks to a month, maybe two months at the outside. Make sure you
guys all keep your eyes out! [22:00  3 March 2317 GST]

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

This was replaced just prior to my sending this message. With so many out of
comms and more potentially going, it's somewhat important for those who remain
behind to at least try to keep it reasonably full of debris. If it's not, it
will cease to exist, and parts and money and time will have been needlessly
wasted. And speaking for myself at least, I'm not inclined to replace it again,
and risk wasting even more, if it does go down prematurely, so please keep this
in mind and do what you can, as will I.
