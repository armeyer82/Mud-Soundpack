00:52 Sophie
She is a member of the Host alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This stick figure woman appears to be in her late thirties and stands 5 feet and 3 inches tall with a small bust size. Her round face bears a soft and soapy complexion. She is wearing a bouquet of daisies in her confused, dark purple hair, which is pulled into braided pigtails. She has surprised turquoise eyes with an itty bitty nose above brilliantly white, not vampire-like teeth.  She is surrounded by a thick, sticky web. She appears to have adopted a paranoid stance. She is surrounded by a thin bubble of purple gum.
She has a tattoo of a pumpkin on her left hip, a vivid purple tattoo of a Popeye's spicy chicken leg on her face, and a pink tattoo of an absolutely incredible tramp stamp on her lower back.
She is wearing navy blue lip dye on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering red with silver bells and adorned with red and green sparkles and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering red with silver bells and adorned with red and green sparkles.
For a top, she is wearing a black t-shirt with the words 'I ate the playerbase' scrawled on the front in blood red lettering. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of fuzzy purple fleece pajama pants covered in tiny red Z's over a pair of tiger print tights. She has a hand crocheted pink tea cozy on her head. She is wearing a purple pair of LED flip flops over a pair of bright purpl
00:52 e fuzzy socks on her feet. She is wearing a cherry twizzler around her waist. She is also wearing a chalkboard, a searching probe of curiosity, a large blue hula hoop, Sophie's portable library, your doom, a super long calico kitty cat tail, a purple gumball, a sleek silver anti iPad, an orange spacesuit jet, a lightning bolt, a sticky note, a Miriani HR department lanyard, a constantly blinking light, the seventh dimension, a miniature vacuum tube, a long gold locket with an atomic pink panda-shaped sparkly charm, an "I scripted for all my points" bracelet, a giant ear of corn, and a brick wall.
She is carrying an electronic tea infuser in her left hand.

00:52 Sophie says, "We would need at least a couple week's notice for something like this. In addition, as you know, we aren't doing the special event thing right now. My suggestion would be to prioritize a couple items you would like special. If it's not complicated, we might be able to do two things by Wednesday."

00:52 Kitty Mars says, "that's fair enough"

00:57 [Chatter] Beatrice Carmichael transmits, "Did he mention this to you personally?"

00:57 Kitty Mars says, "oh i'd say it's engraved inside so the action occurs and you look inside the shell and the message is there just as with a greeting card or other invitation."

00:57 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Me? No. I've not talked to him. I try to stay out of things like this, but I do have to admit curiosity."

00:57 Sophie says, "All those poor sea creatures you killed just so you could have your own special wedding invite."

01:01 Sophie says, "I think this can be done, and I could do it tomorrow. Just specify rather than a wedding invite, that these are clam shells or some kind of shells. It probably wouldn't be obvious that it's an invitation if you're just holding a shell."

["Intergalactic Battle Taxi" Weapons Room 3] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Rolukssica; Flattened Landing Area.

11:26 #$#soundpack_pong

11:26 #$#soundpack_lag 122

11:26 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: I've been traveling in the same direction.

11:28 #$#soundpack_pong

11:28 #$#soundpack_lag 89

11:28 [Newbie] Erik Yobi: Does your current coordinates change? I mean is the ship actually moving? What's the directions to the nearest beacon that you use to measure the distance?

11:31 #$#soundpack_lag 113

11:31 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: It appears to be changing. The cords that is. It works when I'm going south but when I travel down I don't seem to be getting any closer to where I'm trying to get to. Might just be me being tired and dumb but, as I manualed southeast and up while traveling all the way out here, I figured going down would lower the distance.

11:32 #$#soundpack_pong

11:32 #$#soundpack_lag 121

11:32 [Newbie] Erik Yobi: Okay, then it sounds like it's just a matter of orientation. For instance, imagine an equilateral triangle, with angles A, B, and C. You travel from A to B, which means you travelled alot in one straight direction, and yet you are still just as far from angle C.

11:33 #$#soundpack_pong

11:33 #$#soundpack_lag 105

11:33 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: Hmm ok. Then I'm just a tired cally and I'm being perinoid. Thanks for the help and listening to my rambeling. I'll make michael figure it out when he wakes up so I don't have to.

11:33 [Newbie] Erik Yobi: Bottom line is, keep travelling, and eventually you will start noticing a difference.

12:20 #$#soundpack_lag 113

12:20 [Chatter] Tom Tucker chuckles and transmits, "Don't forget you can also go diagonally out of the sector, even in all 3 directions at once. Could be roids are harder to find if people are using all the main cardinal directions. I know it's tricky with several roid haulers all using the same sector. Also, a galactic map unit upgrade is essential. Same with the directional long range scanner upgrade. That'll help you not run into other roid haulers."

12:23 [Chatter] Jack West transmits, "The easiest way to do things is go buy some interdictors, and blockades, use your roid hauler to destroy other assholes that are taking your asteroids, destroy compitition."

12:24 [Chatter] Cris Smith transmits, "I go to the 1 1 1 cords then one unit diagonal then back to the 1 1 1 cords then north south and start over thats my basic pattern."

12:26 #$#soundpack_pong

12:26 #$#soundpack_lag 108

12:26 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "That works. The simplest way to put things is, what ever coords you use to get out of 30, when in a new sector, go to those same coords, use the same direction to get out of that new sector further into uncharted space, and repeat."

12:31 #$#soundpack_lag 120

12:31 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Don't let the numbers overwhelm you. Just remember each number increases as you go the given direction on that axis. So x goes from west to east, y goes from north to south, and z goes from high to low. It takes practice and experience, but roid hauling and debris salvaging are actually excellent introductions to flying during combat missions."

12:31 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Atmo salvaging of any of the 3 types is also good, but you don't entirely have access to your three-dimensional controls on those salvagers. Still, just stay calm and try things out. You'll be good at flying in much less time than you might think."

12:38 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Another piece of advice, maybe two or three. Starship simulators are your big, optionally unfriendly helpers. I didn't actually think of ths when I was teaching myself, but I sorta wish I had. Put a few objects in the sector. They can be the same thing, different things... It doesn't matter. Not anomalies though. But my advice is try leaving your ship on manual and navigating around the sector that way, trying to get to the different things you put in."

12:39 #$#soundpack_pong

12:42 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Reason I say optionally unfriendly is because you can put enemy drones in there. Up to 20 of them in fact. So when you're ready to try flying, but you're nervous about actual missions, or you simply want to try things by yourself so you don't feel like you're letting an actual crew down if you don't do so well, have a look at board post 79542. I came up with some best-guess settings for simulated Praelor ships."

12:45 [Chatter] Jack West transmits, "And you wish, erik yobi!"

13:26 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:26 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

13:26 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:26 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

13:26 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:26 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

13:26 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:26 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:26 The starship is already moving.

13:26 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:26 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:26 Would you like to request landing clearance at Rolukssica?
[Enter "yes" or "no"]

13:26 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

13:26 [1] High Guard Command

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

13:26 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

13:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

13:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

14:00 [Private | Justin Stroup] You transmit, "Hey there. Just a bit of advice. In the future, if your ship ever gets stolen again, especially if it's a missioning ship, don't pay the pirate to get it back. Let people know about it. We could have forced David Arthur to give back your ship without you having to pay him. I'd rather not see people like David take advantage of you and I know I'm not the only one."

14:11 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Immortal Salvation" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Cally the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, and Mell the droid here.

The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.

Robotics Lab Menu Dumps
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Advanced users may choose to write food robot menus out by hand and import them directly. This document will outline the basic format and attributes that constitute a valid menu. Savvy users may note that this format is identical to what is output in the 'Dump Full Menu' option in the robotics lab. In fact, the best way to edit a menu is to first dump it, make your alterations, and then import from there. Note that the tabs are optional.
  Required Attributes
The majority of menu options are prefixed with an identifier followed by a colon and a value. The majority of these identifier are self-descriptive, but here's a brief rundown anyway:
Menu Header: Header Name (string)
Menu Name: Name of Item in Menu (string)
Type: (Food, Drink, Multislice, Drink Bottle, Drink Mix, Food Spread, Baby Food, Baby Drink)
Object Name: Name of Physical Object (string)
Object Description: String Description (string)
  Optional Properties
Additionally, some menu items may have special properties that can be set. These share the same format of 'Identifier: Value'. Here is a possible rundown of special properties. Note that not all properties apply to all types of foods and drinks.
Bites: Number of bites in a food (integer)
Sips: How many sips in a drink (integer)
Plate: Name of plate (string)
Food: The name of the food item on the plate (stri
17:35 ng)
Container: The name of a drink's container (string)
Spread: The name of a spread (string)
Uses: The number of times a spread can be used (integer)
Alcohol: The alcohol content (string) (Light, Moderate, Heavy, Blood Replaced By Alcohol)
Multi-slices have the following extra options:
Slices: The number of slices that come out of the multi-slice (integer)
Parent: The type that comes out of the multi-slice (Food or Drink)
Slice: The name of the slice that comes out (string)
  Options
If the object has options to choose from, they directly follow the list of attributes. Each option name should be followed by a colon and each option should be on a separate line. For example, a color list:
colors:
red
orange
yellow
  Basic Example
Menu Header: Desserts
Menu Name: Basic Chocolate Cake
Type: Multislice
Object Name: a basic chocolate cake %frosting
Object Description: This is a very basic chocolate sheet cake.
Slice: a slice of chocolate cake with %frosting
Parent: Food

18:33 Kitty Mars pushes a small lever away from herself, activating the ship's systems.

18:33 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

18:33 You notice Kitty Mars using the radio to request launch clearance.

18:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

18:34 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:34 Kitty Mars presses a series of buttons on the FTL control console.

18:34 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

18:34 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

18:34 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:34 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

18:34 Kitty Mars inputs a set of coordinates into a small navigation console.

18:34 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:34 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:34 You notice Kitty Mars using the radio to request docking clearance.

18:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Flying Cat. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

18:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:30 Hi Love,
I have sent invitations to the following. Either please provide
me with additional invitees or I can give you the box to send your
own. There were 50 and I've sent out 25 and I used one which is on
the Coffee table. at the Saloon. Please don't open them grins as
the confeti will vanish! There should be 24 left in the box and
i'm sure you will probably want one for yourself. Would appreciate your list as well so that we are on the right page. I'm sure i've probably overlooked people we both think a lot of as well.

19:40 Hi Love,
I have sent invitations to the following. Either please provide
me with additional invitees or I can give you the box to send your
own. There were 50 and I've sent out 25 and I used one which is on
the Coffee table. at the Saloon. Please don't open them grins as
the confeti will vanish! There should be 24 left in the box and
i'm sure you will probably want one for yourself. Would appreciate your list as well so that we are on the right page. I'm sure i've probably overlooked people we both think a lot of as well.

Robotics Lab Menu Dumps
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Advanced users may choose to write food robot menus out by hand and import them directly. This document will outline the basic format and attributes that constitute a valid menu. Savvy users may note that this format is identical to what is output in the 'Dump Full Menu' option in the robotics lab. In fact, the best way to edit a menu is to first dump it, make your alterations, and then import from there. Note that the tabs are optional.
  Required Attributes
The majority of menu options are prefixed with an identifier followed by a colon and a value. The majority of these identifier are self-descriptive, but here's a brief rundown anyway:
Menu Header: Header Name (string)
Menu Name: Name of Item in Menu (string)
Type: (Food, Drink, Multislice, Drink Bottle, Drink Mix, Food Spread, Baby Food, Baby Drink)
Object Name: Name of Physical Object (string)
Object Description: String Description (string)
  Optional Properties
Additionally, some menu items may have special properties that can be set. These share the same format of 'Identifier: Value'. Here is a possible rundown of special properties. Note that not all properties apply to all types of foods and drinks.
Bites: Number of bites in a food (integer)
Sips: How many sips in a drink (integer)
Plate: Name of plate (string)
Food: The name of the food item on the plate (stri
22:44 ng)
Container: The name of a drink's container (string)
Spread: The name of a spread (string)
Uses: The number of times a spread can be used (integer)
Alcohol: The alcohol content (string) (Light, Moderate, Heavy, Blood Replaced By Alcohol)
Multi-slices have the following extra options:
Slices: The number of slices that come out of the multi-slice (integer)
Parent: The type that comes out of the multi-slice (Food or Drink)
Slice: The name of the slice that comes out (string)
  Options
If the object has options to choose from, they directly follow the list of attributes. Each option name should be followed by a colon and each option should be on a separate line. For example, a color list:
colors:
red
orange
yellow
  Basic Example
Menu Header: Desserts
Menu Name: Basic Chocolate Cake
Type: Multislice
Object Name: a basic chocolate cake %frosting
Object Description: This is a very basic chocolate sheet cake.
Slice: a slice of chocolate cake with %frosting
Parent: Food
frosting:
    none
    with chocolate frosting
    topped with chocolate whipped cream
