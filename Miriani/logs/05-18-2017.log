[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Once Upon A Time", the one-person cargo hauler "Chasing Fortune", and the six-person sentinel "Diva" powered down here.

16:22 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

16:22 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

16:22 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

16:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:22 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

16:22 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:22 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:22 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:22 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

16:22 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:22 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:22 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

16:22 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:22 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:22 You need to stand up first.

16:22 You stand up.

16:22 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

16:22 There are no ships here.

16:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

16:22 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

16:22 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
