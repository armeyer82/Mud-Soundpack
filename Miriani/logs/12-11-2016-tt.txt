Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Control Room]
A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off
on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky
from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains
of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is inside the riftflow.
You see a black leather captain's chair, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in
brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a hand-made purple and dark pink
dragon quilt on it, a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold
fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a small white trash bin, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a
wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic
life and coral rocks, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, Purr
the humanoid service robot, an insulated green cooler, and a pair of gray canvas
sneakers here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored
patchwork fabric.

The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air
before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
Lily Kaise says into the hypercaster microphone, "You are showing galactic West

Lily Kaise activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections

Incoming hypercaster transmission from Queen Brynn II at South and Very Slightly
Up: "Rift is in good repair. Now what did you say earlier about the mizzen?"
Lily Kaise says into the hypercaster microphone, "If it's up, you might want to
take it down. It might or might not be helpful here. I've generally only seen it
engaged during a storm. I will admit that I don't know enough about it though."
Lily Kaise says into the hypercaster microphone, "It is actually supposed to aid
with drift so perhaps it would be useful albeit it will slow you down."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Queen Brynn II at South and Very Slightly
Up: "Ahh, well from what I understand in most cases it's helpful in reducing or
negating drift except when the flow is directly at your back when it just slows
you down some."
Lily Kaise says into the hypercaster microphone, "Yeah probably. I know this
ship isn't as stable but I do believe we've both had drift issues."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Queen Brynn II at South and Very Slightly
Up: "And for here, I'm not worried about going fast at all, but that's why it
makes more sense for you to adjust to me since my line is generally a straighter
one than yours. Also though, since I'm trimmed down generally my drift will be
less anyway."
Lily Kaise says into the hypercaster microphone, "So are you still seeing the
Fringe site? We haven't seen it at all or have you already gone beyond it?"
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Queen Brynn II at South and Very Slightly
Up: "We're already past that and another oort cloud."

Headings are in the format of: heading, elevation.
The heading itself is your ship's orientation on its current plane, and goes
from 0 degrees (directly east), through 90 (north), 180 (west), and 270 (south)
to 359 degrees.
Elevation is the degree to which your ship is moving up or down. It goes from
-90 degrees (straight down) to 0 degrees (remaining at the same elevation) to 90
degrees (directly up).

Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh shit."
Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel cancelled."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We have to repair."

Dear Mr. Elemmire,
Recently, you applied to the Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special
Licenses seeking permission to purchase and operate a H-07b Hermes
Communications Two Passenger Luxury Long-Range Sightseer. Your application was
analyzed by our finest psychologists, and we also reviewed all records of your
service as a pilot.
Unfortunately, at the conclusion of this process, we reached the decision that
we could not accept your application at this time.
You are welcome to re-apply at the beginning of the next six week civilian
liaison term. If you choose to do so, we will take your new application
responses into account along with any new additions to your pilot record that
have occurred in the intervening time.
Until then, please accept our condolences and find enclosed one coupon for a
free small Rickety Rick's Spacey Cheesey Fries.
Sincerely,
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses

To whom it may concern,
The bottom line is we've got an over-abundance of orgs and it is getting crazy
with everybody wanting station preference treatment.
Cats has vassalized 4 orgs to try and cut down on this issue. Keegan's org
cannot vassalize. Liam is being left out of everything because people keep
creating new orgs and needing in on stations.
Somebody needs to put their personal drama aside and work towards vassalizing
with Lily's org to help cut down on these problems. If people don't want to do
this, we've a couple of options.
A. Groups can build their own stuff. Which will get into some use my station war
and so I am not really fond of that.
B. Don't whine when you are left out of something because people have to take
turns.
C. Encourage these little one and two man orgs to fold up and go in with
somebody.
I have spoke with Nissi about this and she is in agreement that if people don't
vassalize and get left out, oh well for them. I am not trying to make some
station building power play here but it's becoming unfair for orgs who simply
cannot vassalize to be left out of things because the orgs who can don't want to
do it.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and
both feet are left uncovered.

thing would be to just put up the new beacons. However, remember Akemi suggested
that we try to use Mir as a point to travel from to 777. So I wanted to try it
but I had to figure out how to keep beacons up until these accelerators go
offline."

You ask, "Ah, ok. So what did you do?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So I put up the new beacon for 777 and
got the smallest battery and built a beacon to overlap until the Accelerators go
down. Then on Thursday or close to when the accelerators go down, I'll put a
beacon west of Mir and establish the new Accelerator/Inserters. I don't think it
will reduce travel time by that much but you know how Akemi is. Also, I really
liked using B-24 for the initial Accelerator/Inserter station because I can
power it with solar power and the solar power plant costs 6 megacredits versus
8."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and
both feet are left uncovered.
