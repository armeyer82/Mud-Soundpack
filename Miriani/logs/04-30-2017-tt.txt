[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a bag of felo treats,
a tight black t-shirt with a bright purple dragon embroidered on the front, a
