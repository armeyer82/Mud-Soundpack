Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches
tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips
and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than
average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and
understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally
part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows,
her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight
hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a
small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a crisp coral pink cotton shirt with puffed sleeves, a
pair of navy blue jeans, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of
glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate
ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard
named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck,
both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.

l asteria
a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick,
strong back pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all
fours most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its
front paws as somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp
talons. Its skin is dark gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel
rows of silver-colored ridges run down its back to the tip of its long
tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of curiosity. A slim dark
pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a slim leather
collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits
protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of
the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a
view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing
essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a
working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though
the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire
architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.
The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery

Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I don't think I've seen less
