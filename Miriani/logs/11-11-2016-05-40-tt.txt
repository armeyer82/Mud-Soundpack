Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, a black upholstered sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft
black shamak fur, a small blueberry trash bin, a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an insulated green cooler, a compact white
refrigerator, a red plastic food storage container, a small blue ball containing
a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot, Ciera the humanoid service robot, and Kiwi the little calico CatBot
here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a black upholstered sofa. Johann Rowan is sitting on a
