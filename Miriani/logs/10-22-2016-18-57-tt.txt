Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a dusky pink rattan
cabinet, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple
and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass
top, a small seashell pink trash can, and a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker here.
You can go out.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

--
To Voice of the Corps Lily Kaise,
These, as best as I can piece together, are the events concerning the 12:00 30
April report given to SDC Shule elemmire.
For reasons still unknown, a League cadet by the name of Raymond (I don't have a
last name at this time) attacked Simon Collins, a League pilot, over New Earth.
SDC Elemmire's report shows a League flitter by the name of "Star Flyer" firing
the first shots on a League light transport "Transporting." Several League
pilots have confirmed that "Transporting" belongs to Mr. Collins, and based on
an account given to me by Akemi Bando, I can safely assume that the flitter
belongs to Raymond.
After "Transporting" was attacked, Collins called out over comms that he was
being attacked and sent out a distress call, which alerted the League pilots of
his ship's location. According to hearsay, Ms. Bando urged Raymond to cease his
attacking due to the threat of the AEU navy getting involved. There has, as of
right now, not been any mention of Collins returning fire, but the AEU SDC
report clearly shows shots being fired on the flitter by the transport, as well
as a single shot being fired by the Fringe mule "Masterson" belonging to
Nathaniel Owens. Ms. Bando says that to her, it sounded like "Masterson" may
have also been attacked, but this is unconfirmed.
At this point, after shots have been exchanged, the pilots in question land on
New Earth where they exit their ships. First reports of the incident mention a
physical fight of some sort, but Ms. Bando goes a step further and says that
Raymond attacks Mr. Collins, then AEU pilot Kim Saunders shows up to help
Collins and Owens subdue Raymond. Apparently this fight tires Raymond out, and
the others clean themselves up and return to their business. Ms. Bando mentions
that she was salvaging at the time, and in the rift for the end of this, so her
comms were garbled. I will be interviewing Mr. Collins sometime in the near
future, and will invite yourself and SDC Elemmire to attend if you are inclined.
Below, I have copied Ms. Bando's accounting of events as she sent them. I hope
this information is of use to you, and helps to clarify this situation.
The accounting of the Raymond situation by Akemi Bando:
Dear SDC Hudson,
I was out at the 134th picking through wrecks when I heard Simon and Nathaniel
call out over the tactical channel that they were being attacked over New Earth
by a League flitter. I checked the list of active communicators and saw that
Raymond, a cadet, was active. I asked them to scan the flitter and see if it was
showing a cadet tag. They report it was, so I advised them to not escalate and
instead disengage from what I assumed was simply a confused cadet.
They did so, but Raymond pursued them until they landed. Apparently once they
landed, Raymond also landed and exited his ship. Reportedly, he used physical
violence (punching, kicking, etc) against Simon. Kim turned up at that point and
I believe she helped Simon and Nathanial subdue Raymond, but as I was enroute
between the 134th and B-24 I can't be sure.
Raymond apparently tired out and they were able to release him and go back to
their business. By the time I returned to beaconed space, everything was done.

Dear Melinda,
Regarding vassalization with Starseekers and continuing to contribute to
temporary space stations on behalf of SEAS, I performed some additional analysis
of what SEAS ongoing megacredit obligation to Starseekers would be. Earlier I
did point out to you that since Starseekers provides the majority of power
plants, that as you know, this is a rather expensive part of the construction of
all temporary space stations involved. Additionally, Starseekers runs their
passive Scooping station along with other ad hoc projects. In consideration of
this, the This is a bit concerning to me as SEAS currently only earns
approximately 65 megacredits per month and Starseekers megacredit expenditures
can easily exceed 300 megacredits per month. The minimum contribution I can
offer through vassalization is 25 percent. Therefore, since SEAS has no control
over Starseekers purchases and the share SEAS contribution is automatically
withdrawn, I don't believe that SEAS will be ready to offer a business
investment of vassalization until there is a more positive balance in SEAS
megacredit balance. In lieu of this, I hope that you can still continue to work
with SEAS until we have a few hundred Megacredits on hand which would provide
enough to support the megacredits sufficient enough for a few months until SEAS
earns megacredits at a higher rate.
When SEAS reaches 100 Command, I will put up a passive scooping station which
will yield two megacredits per day. I determined that by using a solar powered
Basic Passive Scoop, that it would last long enough to yield extra megacredit
income to aid in accruing an increase towards its balance of megacredits for
SEAS. So in short, after further analysis, I don't believe that SEAS is ready to
vassalize with Starseekers at this time nor will be able to for until it has
about 500 megacredits available.
I have another concern which is Kim's harsh and rude nature. I know I have
expressed to you my concern before and you do remember her attitude when I
unfortunately lost Starseekers Tier 1 Gunship. She is very over bearing at times
and often makes rather condescending statements without asking questions to
ascertain the facts as she assumes the negative. She has often upset Shule to
the point where he has expressed his concern about remaining with Starseekers as
she has been excessively harsh which is not productive. I realize that
vassalization is a business relationship and you don't need to be the best of
friends or even amicable business partners since all of the transactions are
automatic and do not involve much interpersonal interaction. However, there does
need to be a reasonable level of trust on the part of the lower qualified
organization since the thane has the power to effect spending. When Jonathan
Gray purchased his personal mainframe and related modules, Kim was totally
unaware until it was pointed out to her. Additionally, yu may be aware of the
issue with Angel's purchase of a Gemini for her own use and which she abandoned
in the bubble. Now when properly configured with even minimum upgrades, that's
not an inexpensive ship. Obviously, an expenditure such as this would not affect
SEAS since it's paid for via Starseekers own credits and megacredits are not
applied. Still, it goes without saying that Kim does not seem to observe how her
trustees utilize the organizations resources. I trust Shule but even though I
think Angel may not remain as a trustee, who knows whom sles Kim could appoint
to replace Angel and there are a few in Starseekers whose intentions and/or
judgement calls I to be concerning. I know that Demarco is vying for a trustee
role but he has alreay shown rather severe tendencies of poor judgement. Others
in the organization whom she might appoint may be fine but their lack of
experience could lead to more than a few accidental and expensive module
purchases which could greatly deplete SEAS available megacredit balance. In most
cases, SEAS could absorb this but until SEAS has the ability to convert credits
to megacredits, then SEAS resources could decline rapidly to the point whereby
vassalization no longer works and SEAS can no longer earn megacredit income in
this manner.
Regarding Kim's attitude, during my attempt to travel to the Aquarium, Kim was
incredibly nasty and rude to me concerning our return. I wrote to her prior to
the trip and informed her that we might not return until September 5th or 6th or
even later. She did write back when she committed to joining us that she
preferred to return on september 4th. However she was already aware of the terms
and she had ample opportunity to decline to join. About the third day of the
trip, she started demanding that we had to return by September 4th and accused
me of not being considerate of her and was incredibly nasty and disrespectful.
She also was insistent and controlling of Shule while he relieved me after I had
been navigating our return for hours when she slept. She kept insisting on how
he should deviate from his navigation technique which was to incramentally
change his heading to accomodate gaining on the XL NDB. Shule was making good
progress as was I prior to his taking over. So just to appease her, Shule
performed the navigation Kim's way and we lost ground. Shule knew all along that
her method wasn't viable but he wanted to show her by doing so that her method
was not workable. She vagueley acknowledged this without even so much as a
thanks to Shule for showing her what did work. I can't tell you in words how in
private, Shule expressed his anger to me as she was so rude and disrespectful
towards him. I can tell you that with her attitude, that Nissi would likely have
sent her home in an escape pod or too, I doubt that Kim would be as
disrespectful towards Nissi or you but somehow she believes that she is entitled
to behave towards her own Alliance in this manner when she should be mature
enough to be more supportive. We are not individually to blame for our
government's actions and she has no right to judge us less she judge her own
involvement or lack thereof. We do the best we can with what we have but I can
tell you that if I could still chart we were within range of the earth chart and
I could have gotten us back just fine. At any rate, I have done a lot for kim in
that on our first short trip, we found six planets and received compensation for
space images. During this other trip, although we didn't find the Aquarium, we
discovered three planets and we stopped off in an artifacting area as I felt
that we might as well take a day to realize something profitable. Shule and I
found around 22 artifacts each yet Kim found over 30 to her advantage on my
behalf of course! Since Kim has not been able to make a friend to go to GMG with
and has not been able to join many other expeditions, you would think that she
would at least be grateful and would realize that any expedition is open-ended
in terms of how long it will be in duration. That one needs to be flexible
enough to go with the direction of the captain. That some of the main deciding
factors is available charge and the well-being of the crew. Of course there are
other factors which you well know. My point being here that Kim's being rigid
and selfish of the crew is not acceptable and she will likely not be as popular
on future crew lists if she continues to behave in this manner. Of course if
there is a next time that she is aboard my ship and she behaves this way, there
is a means to send her packing in an escape pod without jeopardizing the rest of
the crew and my ship, she will be thusly dispatched. It goes without saying too,
that Kim was exceedingly rude towards Shule and me on Pierre's trip to the
Aquarium. We attempted to teach her about the Jib and the Mizzen which she
totally didn't grasp and argued with us about. Thankfully, Akemi finally got
through to her and Kim rudely made a statement concerning how Akemi had helped
her and did in such a manner as to make an effort to discount Shule and myself
without any grattitude whatsoever. We're glad that Akemi was understood by Kim
though and she seemed to have some grasp of the Jib after a point. Kim made
other rude and unnecessary statements to Shule and I on more than one instance
during Pierre's trip as well.
It goes without saying anything further, that i do have reservations concerning
an offer to commit SEAS resources to Starseekers without any control whatsoever
over how Starseekers spending behavior is. I was certainly willing to do so
though in hopes that both of our organizations would benefit as receiving a 25
percent dividend is not a small matter. Shule told me that he often has to
convert credits to megacredits so at least SEAS 25 percent might ease some of
that burden. I just would feel more comfortable if Kim would keep a better watch
over her organization's financial activities and/or at least be specific to her
trustees about policy concerning those matters. If Jonathan Gray is ever a
trustee of Starseekers again, I wouldn't trust him not to go behind Kim's back
and purchase for his own personal interests again which could impact SEAS
severely. So when SEAS is ready to offer vassalization to Starseekers, if I
observe eratic spending which is too costly for SEAS to bear, I hope that if
SEAS has to withdraw their vassalization, that you will allow SEAS to continue
to work with you to support Temporary Space stations. With Kim's attitude too,
I'd far rather deal with Ather albeit I doubt that he would ever consider
allowing anyone to offer vassalization to Space Invaders. I can tolerate Kim's
nasty attitude as one has to do so in many business arrangements. One realizes
that interpersonal differences are not the reason for working together to grow
income and to provide benefits to others than oneself.
SEAS would like to grow and develop amembership base. As you know though, it
will be limited in that regard. The profits SEAS will earn though will not be
for my own gain but my intentions, as I mentioned before, will be to act as a
fund-raising organization for pilot supported projects in conjunction with the
AEU Government to benefit AEU citizens and other pilots across all alliances. As
you know I have personally donated billions to help other pilots in need which I
will continue to do. Supporting our other pilots across all alliances through
providing temporary space stations so that they can perform their work without
as much taxation is obviously at the core. I have contributed personal funds but
those are not earmarked for my own use now that they are within the organization
itself.
I look forward to continuing to work with you on behalf of Space Explorers
Amidst the Stars.
Warmest regards
Lily Kaise

To Voice of the Corps Lily Kaise,
These, as best as I can piece together, are the events concerning the 12:00 30
April report given to SDC Shule elemmire.
For reasons still unknown, a League cadet by the name of Raymond (I don't have a
last name at this time) attacked Simon Collins, a League pilot, over New Earth.
SDC Elemmire's report shows a League flitter by the name of "Star Flyer" firing
the first shots on a League light transport "Transporting." Several League
pilots have confirmed that "Transporting" belongs to Mr. Collins, and based on
an account given to me by Akemi Bando, I can safely assume that the flitter
belongs to Raymond.
After "Transporting" was attacked, Collins called out over comms that he was
being attacked and sent out a distress call, which alerted the League pilots of
his ship's location. According to hearsay, Ms. Bando urged Raymond to cease his
attacking due to the threat of the AEU navy getting involved. There has, as of
right now, not been any mention of Collins returning fire, but the AEU SDC
report clearly shows shots being fired on the flitter by the transport, as well
as a single shot being fired by the Fringe mule "Masterson" belonging to
Nathaniel Owens. Ms. Bando says that to her, it sounded like "Masterson" may
have also been attacked, but this is unconfirmed.
At this point, after shots have been exchanged, the pilots in question land on
New Earth where they exit their ships. First reports of the incident mention a
physical fight of some sort, but Ms. Bando goes a step further and says that
Raymond attacks Mr. Collins, then AEU pilot Kim Saunders shows up to help
Collins and Owens subdue Raymond. Apparently this fight tires Raymond out, and
the others clean themselves up and return to their business. Ms. Bando mentions
that she was salvaging at the time, and in the rift for the end of this, so her
comms were garbled. I will be interviewing Mr. Collins sometime in the near
future, and will invite yourself and SDC Elemmire to attend if you are inclined.
Below, I have copied Ms. Bando's accounting of events as she sent them. I hope
this information is of use to you, and helps to clarify this situation.
The accounting of the Raymond situation by Akemi Bando:
Dear SDC Hudson,
I was out at the 134th picking through wrecks when I heard Simon and Nathaniel
call out over the tactical channel that they were being attacked over New Earth
by a League flitter. I checked the list of active communicators and saw that
Raymond, a cadet, was active. I asked them to scan the flitter and see if it was
showing a cadet tag. They report it was, so I advised them to not escalate and
instead disengage from what I assumed was simply a confused cadet.
They did so, but Raymond pursued them until they landed. Apparently once they
landed, Raymond also landed and exited his ship. Reportedly, he used physical
violence (punching, kicking, etc) against Simon. Kim turned up at that point and
I believe she helped Simon and Nathanial subdue Raymond, but as I was enroute
between the 134th and B-24 I can't be sure.
Raymond apparently tired out and they were able to release him and go back to
their business. By the time I returned to beaconed space, everything was done.

This is a report detailing the events which occurred during the early morning of
September 19, 2316.
At approximately 06:35, there was  a call over the general communication channel
by Lily Kaise about a pirate destroyer in Belt of Orion. I was asteroid mining
in Belt of Crias at the time, and immediately flew to Old Earth to board my
fighter, "Shadowblade." As I landed at Earth, Blake Madison reported an Outsider
in sector as well as the pirate.
Once in Belt of Orion, I did a scan to see the ships that were in space. The
results of the initial scan are as follows:
Braxton Schroeder.......................ASS-C1 Allied Starships Destroyer
Kamikaze................................CFY-39-III Coalition Space Superiority
Fighter Mk III
Corvette Omega 99.......................Outsider Battle Thrall Chochle-class
Corvette
Kamikaze is the name of Mr. madison's fighter, as I soon learned when I was
requested to create a communications link with it. The destroyer is the pirate
destroyer mentioned earlier. Blake and I decided to observe the corvette and
destroyer fighting, as the two ships were already in combat when I entered the
sector. Morris Corlew was in the rift at the time, attempting to understand what
was happening from the reports being given over the general and tactical
communications channels. It was he who first brought up the possibility of
communicating via the thrall translation program sold on the Accord of Free
Worlds Command station. I jumped out of the sector and asked the technicians
there to quickly install the translation upgrade, then jumped back to the
engagement site. As I was jumping back in, Keegan Wantz identified the race of
the thralls in question, since nobody knew the corvette designation. He called
them turtles.
When I returned, the pirate destroyer was gone. I do not know if the ship was
destroyed or fled, but the corvette began to lock and fire on me as I was
attempting to communicate with it. Mr. Madison asked me if we should engage, and
I advised to hold off and let me try a few more times to talk to it. After
attempting communications for about five minutes and allowing it to land a few
shots and trying friendly communications, I sent a warning at it to surrender or
I would attack. When it did not respond, I shot it one time with a round of
chaingun fire. The actions of the enemy ship did not change, so I gave the order
to attack.
Just before the fighting began, Akemi Bando entered the sector in her fighter,
"Odokuro" and, mistaking where the engagement was taking place, entered the rift
on a course for a nearby asteroid field. She realized her mistake and turned
around as soon as possible. By the time she returned, Mr. Madison and I had well
and truly engaged the corvette and had damaged it enough so it could not use its
wormhole drive, according to our scans. A transcription of a scan of the ship is
as follows:
Outsider Battle Thrall Chochle-class Corvette "Corvette Omega 99"
--
IFF Transponder Code: Outsider Thrall
Model Designation: THRALL-SAMEKH
Hull damage: 0%
Average damage: 60%
Occupancy: Filled
FTL Capable: No
Weapons: Powered up
Power: Charged
Cargo: Ammunition
Coordinates: (14, 7, 14)
Distance: 1
--
Ms. Bando attempted her own communications with the corvette upon her return to
the engagement site, but met with the same lack of success we did. We noticed we
could not damage the ship beyond this point, so Ms. Bando had the idea to try
and use bolts, launched by her bolt thrower "Boneyard" and, along the way,
picked up Melinda Michaels as a crew member. After that attempt failed, they
decided to see if they could get battlesuits inside the ship to disable it from
within. After a few minutes, that worked and a patrol of Peacekeepers, who had
entered the sector while Ms. Bando and Ms. Michaels were aboard the corvette,
finished it off in short order.
It is worth mentioning that Mr. Corlew, who for this entire situation was in the
rift, reported experiencing the common rift hallucination of being attacked by
the Outsider mothership as soon as it was reported there was an Outsider thrall
in Belt of Orion, and was released from this hallucination as soon as the
corvette was destroyed by the two Peacekeeper ships. It is also worth mentioning
that "Peacekeeper Task Force Psi 0" and "Peacekeeper Task Force Lambda 4" were
very quick to destroy the corvette, responding with wonderful swiftness when
they came across our fight. I would like my thanks to be communicated to the
Accord, and to the crew of those two ships in particular, for their help.
If you have any other questions for me, I would be more than happy to answer
them.

report describing the events involving League cadet raymond attacking fellow
pilots in space and on the ground.
Written by Kim saunders
When I woke up on the morning of April 30th 2316 and swithed my communicator
back on, a conversation was taking place on the tactical channel. After
listening for a while and asking a few questions of my own, I learned that a
league cadet who's name I did not know at the time was firing on a ship
belonging to League Pilot Simon Collins. Moments later, we were informed that
this guy had landed his ship on New Earth. simon collins was assisted by
Nathaniel Owens, and I remember that one of those 2 informed us that they had
the cadet contained in the repair and rearm shop on new Earth. since I was close
to that location, I decided to head there and see if I could convince this cadet
to stop his attack.
League pilot akemi Bando had made a vibro-baton and a set of bounty hunters
restraints for me about a week ago, and she suggested on the tactical channel
that i might need them. Arriving in the repair and rearm shop, this cadet
immediately went after me. he said no word, simply kicked and punched everyone
in his way, and Simon and Nathaniel returned these kicks. I addressed him and
asked him to stop. then I took out my vibro-baton, and switched it on to the low
setting. I showed him clearly that I had a weapon and asked him once again to
stop it, and told him I would use this if he did not stop. He did not listen and
so I beat him once with the vibro-baton.
I considered handcuffing him, and dragging him to the security office, but
decided against it. I advised Simon and Nathaniel to simply walk away and give
him no target to attack. I then left for the landing pad as did they, the cadet
followed us and attempted to resume his attack on us. I simply walked away to
the medical centre to tend to the minor injuries I had, and he did not follow
me. I did ask on the tactical channel whether he was still bothering simon and
Nathaniel, and they told me that he had now followed them to old earth.
a short while later, when I asked whether there was any more news on the matter,
I was told that he had left and Akemi stated he also was no longer active on the
communicator. that was the end for me at that time. although I had heard that
this cadet was shooting at Simon's ship, I missed the beginning of the incident
and did not realize until today, May 1st, that this shooting had happened in
orbit of New Earth. this incident was almost forgotten by me until shule
Elemmeyer asked me about it.
this concludes my report and all I remember at this time. to me it was just
someone who had no idea what piloting was about and who seemingly enjoyed
causing damage and arguments.
I hope this helps you gain insight into what happened, and should I see this
raymond again in the future, I will not be so gentle with him.
take care,
Kim Saunders

destroyed or fled, but the corvette began to lock and fire on me as I was
attempting to communicate with it. Mr. Madison asked me if we should engage, and
I advised to hold off and let me try a few more times to talk to it. After
attempting communications for about five minutes and allowing it to land a few
shots and trying friendly communications, I sent a warning at it to surrender or
I would attack. When it did not respond, I shot it one time with a round of
chaingun fire. The actions of the enemy ship did not change, so I gave the order
to attack.
Just before the fighting began, Akemi Bando entered the sector in her fighter,
"Odokuro" and, mistaking where the engagement was taking place, entered the rift
on a course for a nearby asteroid field. She realized her mistake and turned
around as soon as possible. By the time she returned, Mr. Madison and I had well
and truly engaged the corvette and had damaged it enough so it could not use its
wormhole drive, according to our scans. A transcription of a scan of the ship is
as follows:
Outsider Battle Thrall Chochle-class Corvette "Corvette Omega 99"

Model Designation: THRALL-SAMEKH

Ms. Bando attempted her own communications with the corvette upon her return to
the engagement site, but met with the same lack of success we did. We noticed we
could not damage the ship beyond this point, so Ms. Bando had the idea to try
and use bolts, launched by her bolt thrower "Boneyard" and, along the way,
picked up Melinda Michaels as a crew member. After that attempt failed, they
decided to see if they could get battlesuits inside the ship to disable it from
within. After a few minutes, that worked and a patrol of Peacekeepers, who had
entered the sector while Ms. Bando and Ms. Michaels were aboard the corvette,
finished it off in short order.
It is worth mentioning that Mr. Corlew, who for this entire situation was in the
rift, reported experiencing the common rift hallucination of being attacked by
the Outsider mothership as soon as it was reported there was an Outsider thrall
in Belt of Orion, and was released from this hallucination as soon as the
corvette was destroyed by the two Peacekeeper ships. It is also worth mentioning
that "Peacekeeper Task Force Psi 0" and "Peacekeeper Task Force Lambda 4" were
very quick to destroy the corvette, responding with wonderful swiftness when
they came across our fight. I would like my thanks to be communicated to the
Accord, and to the crew of those two ships in particular, for their help.
If you have any other questions for me, I would be more than happy to answer
them.

To Voice of the Corps Lily Kaise,
These, as best as I can piece together, are the events concerning the 12:00 30
April report given to SDC Shule elemmire.
For reasons still unknown, a League cadet by the name of Raymond (I don't have a
last name at this time) attacked Simon Collins, a League pilot, over New Earth.
SDC Elemmire's report shows a League flitter by the name of "Star Flyer" firing
the first shots on a League light transport "Transporting." Several League
pilots have confirmed that "Transporting" belongs to Mr. Collins, and based on
an account given to me by Akemi Bando, I can safely assume that the flitter
belongs to Raymond.
After "Transporting" was attacked, Collins called out over comms that he was
being attacked and sent out a distress call, which alerted the League pilots of
his ship's location. According to hearsay, Ms. Bando urged Raymond to cease his
attacking due to the threat of the AEU navy getting involved. There has, as of
right now, not been any mention of Collins returning fire, but the AEU SDC
report clearly shows shots being fired on the flitter by the transport, as well
as a single shot being fired by the Fringe mule "Masterson" belonging to
Nathaniel Owens. Ms. Bando says that to her, it sounded like "Masterson" may
have also been attacked, but this is unconfirmed.
At this point, after shots have been exchanged, the pilots in question land on
New Earth where they exit their ships. First reports of the incident mention a
physical fight of some sort, but Ms. Bando goes a step further and says that
Raymond attacks Mr. Collins, then AEU pilot Kim Saunders shows up to help
Collins and Owens subdue Raymond. Apparently this fight tires Raymond out, and
the others clean themselves up and return to their business. Ms. Bando mentions
that she was salvaging at the time, and in the rift for the end of this, so her
comms were garbled. I will be interviewing Mr. Collins sometime in the near
future, and will invite yourself and SDC Elemmire to attend if you are inclined.
Below, I have copied Ms. Bando's accounting of events as she sent them. I hope
this information is of use to you, and helps to clarify this situation.
The accounting of the Raymond situation by Akemi Bando:
Dear SDC Hudson,
I was out at the 134th picking through wrecks when I heard Simon and Nathaniel
call out over the tactical channel that they were being attacked over New Earth
by a League flitter. I checked the list of active communicators and saw that
Raymond, a cadet, was active. I asked them to scan the flitter and see if it was
showing a cadet tag. They report it was, so I advised them to not escalate and
instead disengage from what I assumed was simply a confused cadet.
They did so, but Raymond pursued them until they landed. Apparently once they
landed, Raymond also landed and exited his ship. Reportedly, he used physical
violence (punching, kicking, etc) against Simon. Kim turned up at that point and
I believe she helped Simon and Nathanial subdue Raymond, but as I was enroute
between the 134th and B-24 I can't be sure.
Raymond apparently tired out and they were able to release him and go back to
their business. By the time I returned to beaconed space, everything was done.
-Akemi Bando

Thank you,

Hi Shule,
I am very sad and disappointed at receiving your letter and discovering you have
already left Starseekers, without so much as talking with me about it. I
understand you may have felt in the middle, and I am very sorry for making you
feel that way. But it is not as if I did not listen to what you said to me a few
days ago.
I was already reconsidering my position regarding the vasselization of Seas, and
seeing whether we could at least give it a chance. That I am not just abandoning
our fellow pilots should also be clear that, although Angel will be stepping
down as trustee for a time so she can sort herself and her life out, we already
agreed that she will stay a member, will still be trusted with temp station
building if she wishes to do that, and once she feels better, she will have
another chance as a trustee. This despite the fact she abandoned an org ship in
space 2 months ago, as far as I remember did not tell me, and certainly did not
much to replace it, or call help in to see if we could locate the ship.
Do I really come across as such a heartless person that you think I simply
abandon our fellow pilots at the first sign of trouble? I even gave Tatiana the
chance to make right what she had done. At first I was not even sure whether she
wrote a negative report about the Metal Heart crew on purpose, or whether it was
all the result of an argument on board gone too far. I tried to talk to her
several times, even encouraged her to own up when it became clear the report was
motivated by revenge. Only after several weeks did I suggest she'd be removed
from office, and my letter to that effect only came after yet another phone call
with her where she still claimed her report was written because she was worried,
even when evidence was clearly, or at least in my eyes clearly showing she was
not telling the truth.
I do not know whether you actually consider the situation our pilot core is in
properly. We are threatened with being closed down, depending on how the coming
election goes this may become a very serious possibility. We have one pilot,
Angel, who I am trying to help, but who has officially been declared crazy and
not trustworthy, so she is not allowed to hold any office and she is not allowed
to have any specialty ships. We have one pilot who, if you ask me, in her
attempt to look good with certain "Important" pilots, just talks down to people
whom she considers less skilled than herself, but who did manage to leave one
ship aafloat in space, and who may already have lost 2 other ships if she did
not have help from other pilots on board or from the people back home. Even
Pierre admitted a year ago he was inviting her to watch her create drama, that
is the name she has among pilots from other alliances. I know she also has a
sweet side where certain things are concerned. But tell me, is it really wrong
and heartless that, out of concern for my org and my alliance's pilot core, that
I consider options to make these people aware of what they are doing?
I am not always right. I may have overreacted, but that is why I ran it by you
first. Yes, you are her boyfriend, but you were, at the time, also the only
trustee I could trust and talk to. Consider once how in the middle that makes me
feel, how in the middle I felt a week long when we were stuck together on a
ship, and I never took it out on you.
If you had spoken to me we may have had an opportunity of sorting this out. Now
you have simply left the org, I have no choice than to accept it, and to tell
you what I told Corey when he left. You will always be welcome back in
Starseekers, despite all the differences between us even Lily would have been
welcomed back if she had chosen to do that. Her leaving was the result of an
argument between her and Annie which I had some involvement in, but that even I
had not wanted to go quite that far. But really I do not want to encourage org
hopping. If, in some time when things have cooled down you reconsider your
position, talk to me and we can see where it leads. If, after this letter you
feel like talking, you know I will always listen.
Once again, I am very sad, and sorry it came to this. I will really miss you in
the org, and never, ever, had the intention of driving you off.
Take care,
Kim

Dear Kim, Shule, and Angel,
Anfisa, Nissi, Liam, Morris, and myself have headed off aboard Metal Heart to
rendezvous with Yadira Rivera, Keegan's tactical exploration platform. We are
performing the rendezvous for reasons that are very important to Anfisa and
Nissi. We will need some help from you to make sure that both ships can find
each other. 
Using course information that Yadira Rivera sent through the QE comm, we have
set our course to 75 2 from Coreward Reach. Please set the Torus hypercaster to
that heading. Use power setting 70%. I have asked Sakura, Zandria, and any other
Business Cats who are available to help with our slot from the 2300 to 2359
period, so between your rental time and ours we can achieve a two hour block of
broadcast time.
Since both Metal Heart and Yadira Rivera have QE comms, it is possible for
people here at home to relay a message from one ship to the other, either by
repeating the message over the hypercaster relay channel during the rental
times, or by sending a QE message from Accord of Free Worlds command station to
the intended ship. Since we'll be searching a fairly large area for the
rendezvous, any help you can provide in helping the two ships maintain
communication is very much appreciated.
Sincerely,
-Akemi Bando

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

Once a waystation between Old Earth and its newly settled colony, the Colonial

with the color of the land fading from brownish grasses to grey bedrock.

[Outland City; Narrow One-Way Road]
Narrow and lined on both sides by concrete block walls, this one-way street
occasionally opens to a home or business through an arched wooden doorway on
either side. One such door opens to what appears to an unassuming adobe
building, from which the smell of burning wood and cooking food wafts. The
pavement is dry and dusty, with yellow-green weeds growing through miniscule
cracks. Occasionally you spot a mangy looking dog slinking along in the shadow
of one of the walls.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
1l";U?qg~+q{4613_Ld!FM2%V&15"=+9g/Yl|F[a
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our two asteroid hauling stations,
remember to stay safe, keep a check on your charge and please have EAOS credits
on hand for the tolls."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2636 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Southsouthwest and Slightly Down."
The computer reports that the galleon "Queen Brynn II" has entered the riftflow.

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Wow."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I thought if the

You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant
967" has launched from New Earth.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
_Bl~Jw?ahV>`NyPD!i.<GvBW/g9arqcXWt*>QHd2
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
[General Communication] Soraya Rhyz transmits, "Something about there being an
error with the photos from the Aquarium trip. At least Keegan and I never got
our share for them."
smile lily
You smile at Lily Kaise.
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I haven't gottenp aid for them
or points yet."
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok will stop at Orion to transfer the
module."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello

on hand for the tolls."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2655 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Southsouthwest and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'RockIt!.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Oh, that."
Lily Kaise smiles at you.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "No, I know. And for most of
us it does not matter too much. Is not like we need credits or points."
The starship transitions into another sector.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits,
"Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards
Galactic East."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "But here are a few from trip

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah."
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh my bad."
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I entered 286."

Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh shoot this is dismal."
Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel cancelled."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We'll try somehting different."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286."

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a short-sleeved periwinkle blue sailor top with a white tie, a
pair of blue low rise denim jeans, and a pair of baby blue leather clogs with a
row of multicolored daisies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a light purple flightbag with
a pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, and
waist are left uncovered.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
Mn/{xuqamk%j:EPl?fVm}qdiGQLzUj`oDe?e&s!j
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
