01:09 [Newbie] Anara Webster: Can you not find your ship?

01:11 [Newbie] Daniel Smith: That way, you can see how far away you are. Also, type beacon 30 to get the direction bak to locals.

01:11 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: Was gonna say...

01:15 #$#soundpack_pong

01:17 [Newbie] Bob Smith: Is there a way to see upgrades arranged by point cost?

01:17 [Newbie] Renee Chance: Type points I believe.

01:18 #$#soundpack_pong

01:18 #$#soundpack_lag 105

01:18 [Newbie] Anara Webster: Not quite. That doesn't list upgrades in order, and only lists upgrades in that store.

01:18 [Newbie] Bob Smith: Yeah, I'm not in a store. Just trying to see what I can get for a fighter.

01:18 [Newbie] Victor: It doesn't only cover upgrades, but you might try the POINTSHOP command if you have a Lore computer. That will let you search for upgrades between certain license and combat point ranges.

01:19 #$#soundpack_pong

01:19 #$#soundpack_lag 103

01:20 #$#soundpack_pong

01:20 #$#soundpack_lag 115

01:20 [Newbie] Bob Smith: Pointshop command? Is that part of a menu? Sorry...

01:20 [Newbie] Daniel Smith: If you have a lore computer it will work.

01:20 [Newbie] Victor: No, just type it as a regular command when not in a menu. It's a shortcut.

01:20 [Newbie] Bob Smith: Ah. Sorry, not sure why it didn't work to begin with. Thanks.

01:23 #$#soundpack_pong

01:23 #$#soundpack_lag 103

01:23 [Newbie] Bob Smith: I guess an easier question is what the lowest point cost ship upgrade is so I know how to filter.

01:24 #$#soundpack_pong

01:24 #$#soundpack_lag 109

01:24 [Newbie] Victor: I'd start at 100 license and 50 combat as a baseline.

01:27 [Newbie] Rayette Rucker: How to get my ship to the landing bay at outreach?

01:28 [Newbie] Rayette Rucker: It's in the garage.

01:28 #$#soundpack_pong

01:28 #$#soundpack_lag 113

01:28 [Newbie] Bob Smith: Power it up from inside the ship.

01:28 [Newbie] Daniel Smith: Type request <shipname> on <keyring>

01:28 [Newbie] Anara Webster: If it's powered down, just power it up again.

01:28 [Newbie] Anara Webster: Otherwise, use the transport command inside it.

01:29 #$#soundpack_pong

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

13:51 ["Training" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go south, up, and out.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Planet 118858. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security

21:34 Jenaia the droid

21:34 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a shiny gold metal star keychain.
She is carrying a red handheld planetary surveyor in her right hand.
