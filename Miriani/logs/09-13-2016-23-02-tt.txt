Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a white four poster rattan bed
with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of
lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed
pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst
flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small
oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a clear plastic food storage
container, a small seashell pink trash can, and a fresh fruit juice dispenser
here.
You can go out.

Dear Mr. Elemmire,
Recently, you applied to the Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special
Licenses seeking permission to purchase and operate an AW-2 AEU Flare-class
Twin-Assault Vessel. Your application was analyzed by our finest psychologists,
and we also reviewed all records of your service as a pilot.
Unfortunately, at the conclusion of this process, we reached the decision that
we could not accept your application at this time.
You are welcome to re-apply at the beginning of the next six week civilian
liaison term. If you choose to do so, we will take your new application
responses into account along with any new additions to your pilot record that
have occurred in the intervening time.
Until then, please accept our condolences and find enclosed one coupon for a
free small Rickety Rick's Spacey Cheesey Fries.
Sincerely,
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a white four poster rattan bed
with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of
lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed
pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst
flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small
oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a clear plastic food storage
container, a small seashell pink trash can, and a fresh fruit juice dispenser
here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and a clear camera with a saucy strap. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both
forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both
knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
