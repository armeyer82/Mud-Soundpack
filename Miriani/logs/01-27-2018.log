["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a

12:36 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) (hostile environment)
You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a seashell-shaped ocean blue Hawaiian ginger air freshener, and a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) here.
You can go south.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on 
18:05 top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt, Paws the droid, a black cat, a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes, a fluffy blue cat, Kissy the droid, Kitcat the droid, a transparent trash can, a large soft purple pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an orange tabby kitten, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a transparent architectural design simulator, Mekensie the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a bright turquoise cooler, a large sandstone fireplace with a stone harth and a teak mantel, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a stack of neatly split logs, a large white refrigerator, a compact bright red cooler with zip up compartments along the sides, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a pair of gray sneakers with red laces here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) here.

23:34 --------------------
Section 6: Starship evasive maneuvers.
--------------------
Evasion is a fairly trivial matter. The goal is simply to keep your starship moving at all times to prevent enemy weapon locks and firing. Of course, the best enemies will be skilled in preemptive locking, but clever evading can still make that a difficult procedure to follow.
Strategies: One of the best strategies to use in evasion and preventing preemptive locking is to continue moving along both the X-Y and Z axis. To do this, simply go into MANUAL navigation mode and input a + or a - into your navigation console. You will be prompted on which direction to move along the X-Y axis. If you enter a 5, your ship will stay in the same X-Y coordinates and only move along the Z axis (up or down, depending on whether or not you used a + or a -). If you enter another number, however, your ship will move both up or down and in whatever direction you specified. This creates two new coordinates that your enemy must predict before successfully firing on you.
If you're attempting to keep within firing range of your enemy (which is advised, as offense is the best defense!), you will want to view the STARMAP (or SCAN your opponent) and choose a position that will keep you within one unit of your enemy. This can oftentimes be more difficult than it sounds, as your enemy is more than likely following the same guidelines as you; that is to say, constantly moving. The best you c
23:34 an do is get a feel for how the enemy is moving. More times than not, your opponent will fall into a pattern of movement. If you're able to detect this pattern, half the battle is won already.
As you progress through license points, you will gain access to more powerful starships with more advanced technologies. One such technology is very useful for evasion: subwarp. The subwarp drive will allow you to make the ultimate evasive maneuver, which is the ability to nearly instantly move your starship to any unoccupied coordinates in the sector. The drive takes a long time to recharge, however, so it's best to save a subwarp jump either for when you're critically damaged and need time to repair, warping to a nearby planet or space station to land, or even to get into weapons range of an enemy.
The strategies outlined here are only the most basic. Undoubtedly you will uncover more interesting and effective strategies in the course of your piloting career.
