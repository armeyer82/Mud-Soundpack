A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

23:54:42 Recent Major Changes:

-----
2017 Exploration Revision

We have revised planetary surveying and space imaging and added a new progression of equipment to these activities. The purpose of this is to make the benefits of exploration less frontloaded while adding to the sense that exploration crews are making new discoveries and doing important work.

 - Let's start with the bad news. Planetary surveying and space imaging as you know them are now just preliminary work and will reward you less than before.

 - A range of spectroscopes and other more sci-fi scanners have been added as follow-on work to space imaging. Each type of scan you perform increases the value of the data you will bring home.

 - Planetary surveying now actually generates complete planetary systems.

 - The ship's computer will now let you perform field triangulations to jump your ship into orbit over newly discovered planets.

 - Probes of various types have been added, deployable for close approaches, extended observations, and planetary landings. Probes are additional follow-on work after imaging points of interest, as well as follow-on work to planetary surveying.

 - Existing points of interest have been retroactively flagged as if the new data has already been gathered, since they have already paid out under the old structure. The onboard library upgrade will reflect this.

 - Exploration ships now possess surveying databanks to hold all of this data, whi
23:54:42 ch can be extended with new upgrades.

 - A Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying help file has been added to explain the new activities and equipment.

As with any new addition, expect minor adjustments to occur for a little while until we feel the system is in a balanced state. Future plans for expansion include exploring the surface of new planets!

Recent Minor Changes:

-----
New profiles now require a short character concept to be written first.
   Posted 6 days, 2 hours, 35 minutes, and 16 seconds ago
-----
Cadet point caps have been adjusted. The limit in each category for those without an approved concept is 100. The limit for those with a concept but no profile is 250.
   Posted 6 days, 2 hours, 16 minutes, and 48 seconds ago
-----
Old space features (oort clouds, asteroid clusters, systems, etc.) will now be purged periodically. The purged features are algorithmically determined to be of little relevance, so ideally you won't notice much of a difference. Let us know if you do!
