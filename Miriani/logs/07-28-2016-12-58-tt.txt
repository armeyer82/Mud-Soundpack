Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;
Docking Bay.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a white four poster rattan bed
with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of
lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed
pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a small
oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Excellent
work on our first performance goal! Let's go for the second!"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Ather, can I pay you for another
inserter please?"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "After testing the new 465 route
I have found that I got dumped in the old 465 where the op station and stuff was
placed, so I'm going to put a rift marker, low power accelerator and inserter in
here so nobody gets trapped out here."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Ather?"
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Why did you put the roid
processor in a different spot."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Because last time we did this
the payout increased signifigantly because of a new batch of asteroids.. like
seriously signifigant. the first roid to be brought in was something like 273
million credits for the person."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "And it's been in the plan for
the last couple of weeks. I wasn't expecting someone to build an op and salvage
processor out there. I'm about to fix it so both are accessible. As soon as I
can find someone to spend my credits on an inserter."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "If you could wait for us to get
another 1900 command points I can get you an inserter."
[General Communication] Damien Goss chuckles.
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "So it only drags in on the
return trip?"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Actually it drags in on the
outgoing trip, not the return."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Wacky."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "So I'm going to put up a rift
marker, insert and low power accelerator. The only part I can't buy is the
inserter."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "I'd gladly give Ather double the
credits for the inserter if only he were listening."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Morning."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "At least we have an op station
out there that no one wanted and no one uses."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "However until I can get the
temporary bounce point up and running it would be inadvicable for anyone that
isn't on a rift capable ship to go out there. Hello tobias."
[General Communication] Eugene Silverlance transmits, "Hello."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Checked all the transports I
got access to, no dice."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Did find a random Cats asteroid
processor though."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Yeah it's old and non
vassalized."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Silly vassals."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Ather Jammoa answer your
phone."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "I attempted to call Ather, it
did not work."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Thank you Cesar."
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "He is a foreverbutt."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Off hand does anyone know
how many points you need for the improved anchor package? If not I'll just look
it up real quick."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "250 industry."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "THanks."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, we must buy an inserter?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I shall do this."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And to add insult to injurry, I
will not call Cesar Ysidro back."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Oh thank you. I will reimburse
you."
[General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "The day is saved."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aww."

brightly from the nearby asteroid outpost are all that keep the surface from
being in total darkness. The light forms shadows with sharp edges, highlighting
every boulder and dangerous peak.

Subject: Apologies and welcome to the new 465
Author: Damien Goss
Posted: 01:16 28 July 2316 GST
--
465 is back up and running. It is in a new position which had been the plan for
the last couple of weeks after seeing so many asteroids come with low rewards.
We moved the station about 50 light hours away from the original location but on
the same basic heading. I apologize for the orgs that purchased parts for the
salvage op stuff in the original 465. the sector is still accessible you'll just
need a hauler with a rift drive to access it. to
This means, Please do not put a marker beacon or anything there or you will pull
unsuspecting haulers out of the accelerator into a sector where they have no way
home from. Again I apologize for this and hhope we can get some of those ops
done without much inconvenience.

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the
five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" as it settles down upon the
nearby landing pad.
Lily Kaise just arrived.
A Tardick lizard named Athena, perched on Joel Kringle's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

ftl battle of mir
Ted Warburton stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.
The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its
existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased
destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris
still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.
A beacon marks the site of the failed attempt to hold back an Outsider task
force on its way to Mir at the start of the Outsider War. Nearby space glitters
with the wreckage of starships and other debris.
Via general sector communication, Beacon M-534 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Lidia's Pride.' Welcome to Battle of Mir."

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives
a new notice.
read comm
You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Good day AEU. I have just received a
notification from Andrew Lambeth's office. I was informed that Demarco scott
from AEU and Kirk Walthom of the fringe complained to our Liaison via letters
that the aEU Voice should have been involved in the recent fiasco on Chetumal
whereby Mike Marshall sold starships which had felo aboard who were expeled onto
the landing pad and into the spaceport. Our liaison States the following -- This
government's position is, naturally enough, that some ecological incident on
Chetumal does not affect New Earth. Our only obligation toward the Fringe is not
to attack them, and to our knowledge we are continuing to live up to this
obligation fully. I remind you that we have no alliance with the Fringe, and if
you as pilots individually wish to give the Fringe aid, that should be an
individual and hopefully very carefully considered decision. [18:15 28 July 2316

Subject: Assisting Other alliances with internal Issues is not the
Responsibility of the AEU Government, the AEU Voice of the Corps nor AEU Pilots
Author: Lily Kaise
Posted: 18:20 28 July 2316 GST

Good day AEU. I have just received a notification from Andrew Lambeth's office.
i was informed that Demarco scott from AEU and Kirk Walthom of the fringe
complained to our Liaison via letters that the aEU Voice should have been
involved in the recent fiasco on Chetumal whereby Mike Marshall sold starships
which had felo aboard who were expeled onto the landing pad and into the
spaceport. Our liaison States the following -- This government's position is,
naturally enough, that some ecological incident on Chetumal does not affect New
Earth. Our only obligation toward the Fringe is not to attack them, and to our
knowledge we are continuing to live up to this obligation fully. I remind you
additionally, that we have no alliance with the Fringe, and if you as pilots
individually wish to give the Fringe aid, that should be an individual and
hopefully very carefully considered decision.

Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

UPDATE TO THE 465 SITUATION
I have set up a marker beacon in Waypoint sigma 464 with an inserter and an
accelerator. This was to assist any ships that are accidentally pulled out of
the rift there. so far nobody has been pulled out of the flow on the return trip
which s the only concern now. At the time of this writing several trips have
been made back and forth and nobody has screamed for help. So if you follow the
instruction I will provide below you should not have any problems.
travel to 465.
When you drop out, should you be in 464, simply travel to 465 again. It will be
a very short trip.
For your return trip travel to 02 from 465 and cross your fingers.

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this

lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

[Starship "Money Maker"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a swiveling dark purple leather gunner's chair, a large leather couch, a

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee with a large neon pink spiky
flower appliqued on the front, a pair of tight white denim jeans with a small
dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of tan suede
clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
wOKAkORH(96h0fdD!L7d~/0-<8pfTR>^%RMU<!ZE
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Money Maker. Welcome to Accord space."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire cheers for Lily Kaise!
[Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "Increases the range of randomness I
assume."
A large white sabre-toothed felo wanders in from the airlock.
A large white long-eared felo wanders out.
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "The upgrades increase the caps for size,
and I'm pretty sure they shift the entire range upwards."
Lily Kaise just entered the ship.
A personal hoverpallet loaded with low-grade dry felo chow floats in behind Lily
Kaise.
Lily Kaise glides south.
[Newbie Help] Demarco Scott transmits, "I haven't has this small of a site in
years."
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "But every 'roid is random."
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "You'll get some outliers now and again."
Lily Kaise glides in from the south.
Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed
with bright white floodlights.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored
in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Money
Maker! Welcome to home space!"
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "This org founder has her priorities
damned straight!"
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for landing clearance.
A hefty white sabre-toothed felo wanders out.
A big white sabre-toothed felo suddenly rushes into the room.
A large white sabre-toothed felo jumps onto a swiveling dark purple leather
gunner's chair and immediately settles in.
A large white sabre-toothed felo lies down and curls up into a tight ball,
closes its eyes, and appears to sleep.

The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.

[17.56 28 July 2316 GST] From the Liaison..................................The
office of Andrew Lambeth has received a pair of letters from Demarco Scott, one
under his own name and one apparently forged under the name of Kirk Waltham,
whoever that is. The letters are not very clear, but taken together, they seem
to reference an incident involving felo and salvage containers on Chetumal, and
criticize the Voice of the Corps for not doing more to help. This government's
position is, naturally enough, that some ecological incident on Chetumal does
not affect New Earth. Our only obligation toward the Fringe is not to attack
them, and to our knowledge we are continuing to live up to this obligation
fully. Please remind our pilots that we have no alliance with the Fringe, and if
our pilots wish to give them aid, that should be an individual and hopefully
very carefully considered decision.

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.
