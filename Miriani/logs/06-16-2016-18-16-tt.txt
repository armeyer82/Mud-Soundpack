Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a high tech
silver star print holovid, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid
service robot, a clear plastic food storage container, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and Xavier the big silver soldier
felo here.

I found a home for this sweet felo. It was a giveaway. Generally just ask on
General or drop a letter in the mail to the pilot who posts here as this saves
on unnecessary clutter of the board. Thanks for asking.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and
coral rocks, Purr the humanoid service robot, a clear plastic food storage
container, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and
a high tech silver star print holovid here.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

[Starship "Siegebreaker"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and
coral rocks, Purr the humanoid service robot, a small yellow ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a high tech silver star print holovid, a clear
plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, and a blue plastic
food storage container here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

You say, "That's fine."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I don't see it on the reference."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Take your time Hun but please go check
the range office if you can?"
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for landing clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU
transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
'Sure
You say, "Sure."

Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.
You scramble to your feet.

You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and

Lily Kaise smiles at you.

You say, "Get there from one sector west of Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Wow ok that's different."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah and it's not showing up on the
reference."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok so here we go."
Lily Kaise grins.
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
grin
You grin.
sit couch
You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it.
Lily Kaise exclaims, OOCly, "Sorry don't want you to burn the house down!"
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
ooc Heh. Nah, I can cook and do multiple things at once.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
You say, OOCly, "Heh. Nah, I can cook and do multiple things at once."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
;6V@~}?G)qVrF>iUl8,6gpn#KU)>Zm~0m(<)>RvK
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 3110 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Westsouthwest and Very Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'William Dove.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
'Go sector west
You say, "Go sector west."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Beta 287."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
'oh
You say, "Oh."
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oops."
'The accelerator is one sector west of Belt of Orion.
You say, "The accelerator is one sector west of Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel cancelled."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
'Go to 025

Your normal bubble travels will be fixed between now and a few days. We have
replaced the passive beacon but there may be a conflict with the marker beacon.
So, we may have to wait till it sorts itself out. Also, we will be combining the
xeno and salvage stations out at the belt of Orion in a few days. This will mean
that we will be dumping salvage into the furnace to maintain the station on a
daily basis. So, I hope that pilots don't mind helping out with that while they
earn a few credits.
If you have any questions, complaints or whatever, give me a shout.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "What worries me about Kim is I think she
is in it for power She doesn't seem to have much of a relationship with
Mutuality pilots either and I was so wanting to start working on that.."
'Not sure it's for power, but it seems she's trying to find her place still.
You say, "Not sure it's for power, but it seems she's trying to find her place

Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I think it is because why did she
want to run against me?"

"Beats me." You shrug. "Maybe just for the opportunity to see what Voice is
like?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I doubt it honestly."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Because she well knew that if nobody ran
that I would have retained the office."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

You say, "I mean, she really doesn't do much leadership with the org except get
mad when no one shows up to the meetings or whatever."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So that was... rather deliberate and

'Oh. Well, I didn't know she used to call you out on it.

'Well, if we go to Hall of Pain. Then we'll do our own exploration.
You say, "Well, if we go to Hall of Pain. Then we'll do our own exploration."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Keegan is such a loose cannon that he's

Exploration Ships:
Two-Person Scout 3,750,000.00 (bikura)
AY-71 AEU LONG-RANGE SCOUT
Class: Scout
Requirements: 10 industry points        0 combat points
Model number: AY-71                     Designation: Scout
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 8000         Standard battery hours: 18
Docking bay size required: 12.5
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
The two-person exploration scout is the AEU pilot's usual choice for
exploration. Outfitted with the right battery, it can go for a very long time.
It is also small, comfortable and reasonably well armed so it can hold its own
against a minor enemy force. Some of the later and larger ships will be able to
hold more charge, but the scout seems to be many a pilot's choice regardless.
If a pilot has the right amount of points (100 industry, 100 space combat and 10
exploration), they can upgrade their exploration scout now into an advanced
scout at a shop named Emerging Technologies on New Earth. This advanced scout is
still an exploration vessel, but more heavily armed than the initial design.
However, you also lose a significant portion of your battery charge when
upgrading to this level of scout.
Two-Person Void Piercer 660,000,000.00 (endymion Revo Technologies)
RDT-E1M9S REVO DEVELOPMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES VOID PIERCER
Class: Scout
Requirements: 1000 industry points      1250 exploration points
Model number: RDT-E1M9S                 Designation: Void Piercer
Turret hardpoints: 0                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 12000        Standard battery hours: 24
Docking bay size required: 12.5
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 110%
The Void Piercer has six hours more than the exploration scout in standard
charge, and seems to go slightly faster. Aside from that though, it seems to for
the most part be unremarkable from the exploration scout. The expensiveness is
due to the cost of needing to re-research the information which led to the
ship's construction since the original prototype was stolen.
One-Person Vostok 250,000,000.00 (Farport the Black room)
ME-3Q/X-42 EAOS-MUTUALITY-TANDEM VOSTOK-CLASS EXPERIMENTAL RIFT CAPSULE
Class: Capsule
Requirements: 1500 industry points      0 combat points
Model number: ME-3Q/X-42                Designation: Vostok
Turret hardpoints: 1                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 0            Standard battery hours: 48
Docking bay size required: 2.5
Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 150%               Max Cruising Speed: 150%
This ship is capable of going far deeper into the rift than any other ship. As a
result, it moves ssignificantly faster than any other vessel currently available
that is equipped with a rift drive, and comes with one already installed.
Furthermore, this ship is not very good at locating points of interest until it
is practically on top of them, though some tests have shown that if you decrease
your speed, you're able to detect things from farther out. You cannot do any
manual moving in this ship, and you cannot leave it in hostile environments
since it does not have an airlock.
Two-Person Arrow (approval required) (Aenea)
AY-72 AEU ARROW-CLASS EXTREME-RANGE SCOUT
Class: Scout (Limited Alliance Support)
Requirements: 3500 industry points      1500 exploration points
Model number: AY-72                     Designation: Arrow
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 12000        Standard battery hours: 36
Docking bay size required: 12.5
   Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 110%
This is a prewar alliance exploration vessel, and is virtually unremarkable from
other exploration vessels except for a few things. The biggest thing is that it
has a subwarp drive. This subwarp drive basically creates a mini wormhole which
can get you from one part of the sector to any coordinates within the sector you
designate. So, if you want to get to a station which is located at 5, 4, 2 you
would set the subwarp drive on a set of coordinates that is one unit away from
the station. For example, 6, 4, 2 or 4, 4, 2 etc. In addition to the subwarp
drive, the arrow also has a very nice battery on it which with present upgrades,
can make the ship have a good, three solid days of charge if you play your cards
right. However, you will have to fill out an application if you ever want to own
one, and approval or denial notifications can take a while to get to you. You
will be notified by mail one way or the other.
Five-Person Magnetar (Explorer Corps only) (Aenea)
AY-9X AEU MAGNETAR-CLASS EXPLORATION VESSEL
Class: Gunship (Limited Alliance Support)
Requirements: 5000 industry points      2500 exploration points
Model number: AY-9X                     Designation: Magnetar
Turret hardpoints: 9                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 32000        Standard battery hours: 38
Docking bay size required: 60           Docking bay capacity: 25
Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 95%
Little is known about this ship, as only members of the explorer corps can get
one, and no one I presently know of is a member of the explorer corps. So, until
we can get further details about the vessel from someone in the explorer corps,
please refer to the information about it written above.

Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
The ship has passed through an area filled with radio transmissions, the surface
of a bubble filled with gradually increasing transmissions which reach a
crescendo and then stop all at once. In the silent center of the bubble, bits of
wreckage are detected.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "There we go."

battle with several Outsider and Thrall ships. The Soothsayer's lasers and
plasma minicannons are blazing out in all directions, impacting their targets
with devastating effect. In the midst of the debris of several destroyed
Outsider ships, one Thrall starship is in the process of exploding under fire
from several of the Soothsayer's blue-beamed lasers, its restricting chain
shattering into pieces around it. On the other side of the AEU cruiser, a very

A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pair of leather thong sandals with a white flowered print. She
is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a
slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a sturdy
navy blue canvas AEU backpack, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both
biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist,
both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left
uncovered.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Xenological

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

a white Soothsayer t-shirt
On the front of this white t-shirt is a full-color depiction of a shiny,
silver-colored AEU Soothsayer cruiser engaged in a furious space battle with
several Outsider and Thrall ships. The Soothsayer's lasers and plasma
minicannons are blazing out in all directions, impacting their targets with
devastating effect. In the midst of the debris of several destroyed Outsider
ships, one Thrall starship is in the process of exploding under fire from
several of the Soothsayer's blue-beamed lasers, its restricting chain shattering
into pieces around it. On the other side of the AEU ship, a very large Outsider
ship is cracking apart under the deadly onslaught of all three of the
Soothsayer's plasma minicannons. Through a viewport in front of the AEU cruiser,
you can see the silhouette of the pilot as he deftly flies his ship between
trails of weapon's fire from the remaining enemy ships. There is little doubt as
to the outcome of this battle, as the Soothsayer has taken no damage at all from
the Outsider vessels.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Great, we've
almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"

a white Pulsar t-shirt
On the front of this white t-shirt is a full-color image of a shiny,
silver-colored AEU Pulsar gunship engaged in battle with several Outsider ships
in the space over New Earth. The Pulsar's glowing green lasers and plasma
minicannons are blazing out toward the Outsiders in righteous fury, each one
impacting its target ship with devastating effect. Through a viewport in front
of the Pulsar, you can see the silhouette of the pilot as he directs his
gunners' deadly fire against the Outsiders, all the while maneuvering his swift
ship between the trails of torpedo and laser fire from the remaining enemy
ships. There is little doubt as to the outcome of this battle, as the Pulsar has
taken no damage at all from the Outsider ships.

Lily,
I have no crew as of yet. First I'm taking the mod transport down, and will
artifact in that myself. So unless your planning on taking a carrier and not
your platform I don't know who would come. We could put the word out about it,
however with Keegans trip leaving that day what your likely to get is a lot of
nasty things said over general or in lounges behind our backs which I'd rather
avoid if possible. So tell me your thoughts on this because I'm good going down
alone and the transport is now loaded with a passive beacon and 4 basic recharge
mods just incase we'd have to stop and charge going or coming. or more likely I
would need to as my battery is only 36 hours.
talk later Sean.

Module Transports:
Four-Person Accord Space Module Transport 20000000.00 (AFW Command)
AFW SPACE MODULE TRANSPORT
Class: Light cruiser
Requirements: 20 industry points      0 combat points
Model number: AFW-063                   Designation: Accord Space Module
Transport
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 12000        Standard battery hours: 18
Docking bay size required: 160
This ship will allow you to move around temporary space station modules and
position them properly so that you can create a temporary space structure in the
sector of your choice. Despite being a light cruiser, this vessel does not have
a docking bay, replacing the dockin bay with the module bay. It can hold up to
28 temporary space station modules.
Two-Person Accord Space Module Scout 20,000,000.00 (AFW Command)
AFW SPACE MODULE SCOUT
Class: Scout
Requirements: 20 industry points        300 exploration points
Model number: AFW-071                   Designation: Accord Space Module Scout
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 4000         Standard battery hours: 20
Docking bay size required: 60
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 110%
This ship, though smaller than its cousin and able to fit only seven temporary
space station modules has two hours more charge, and also has an exploration
point requirement. Even with this exploration point requirement however, it does
not seem like this ship has exploration-grade sensors, and cannot be fitted with
an impeller upgrade.
AC-2X SPACE CONSTRUCTOR 100,000,000.00 (Aenea)
Class: Light cruiser
Requirements: 2500 industry points
Model number: AC-2X                     Designation: Space Constructor
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 10000        Standard battery hours: 12
Docking bay size required: 225
This vessel is able to hold 28 temporary space station modules, just like the
module transport. However, this particular design which is currently only
available to the AEU, has the added benefits of not needing space lifters at all
for temporary station construction. This is because you can construct the
temporary stations from inside the docking bay, and thenjust push the station
itself out when you need to. It appears that you can have more than one
temporary station constructed and ready for deployment in the module bay at any
given time, but the modules used in the construction will still count towards
the module bay's total limit.

Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Maybe we don't get to buy
super secret new super duper repairing and fixing upping tech."

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
CLyz{rb1}$}1.>Krqbs"2##-2ec}`mQ4V+IiG!Y(
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Now, the rest of you, find out
where I can buy a spider."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "There or on helios too."
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2547 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Northnortheast and Up."
Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it

Starseekers expedition Information
 
Hello,
I write this letter to you to confirm that you are on the crew list of the
expedition I am organizing. this letter also contains some information about the
trip.
 
- we wil be traveling aboard Akemi's science vessel, which she kindly has made
available for this occasion. akemi will hand out keys just before departure. we
will bring a few other ships along, keys for these will be handed out if and as
needed.
- We will start gathering for departure on the first of June at 23:00 GST. we
wil meet on Old Earth in the coffee shop. this coffee shop is located in the
spaceport, between the landing pad and the south point exit. We are aiming for a
departure time of 23:59 GST.
- You should be prepared for a trip that will take roughly 2 weeks. Melinda has
made various food and drink dispensers available, but it might be nice if you
brought a small amount of food for greater variety.
- to keep it fair for everyone, and to make sure we can bring a full crew,
everyone is allowed to bring only 1 pet felo. If you choose to bring one, you
are also required to bring a felo spacesuit for it.
- we will have a few crew members who have never been on an expedition like
this. If you do not have any rift drive repair tools yet, do not worry. akemi
has spare tools available and we will still have time to craft more of such
tools.
- As of the time of this writing, the crew for this expedition is as follows:
Akemi, anfisa, Melinda, Lillian, shule, Lily, Nissi, Liam, Michael, Blake,
simon, Nathaniel, Morris, Sakura, Zandria and myself. 
 
should you have any questions that I have not answered in this letter, feel free
to contact me and ask. also if you are not sure you are still awake during the
gathering and departure time, talk to me or Akemi and we will make arrangements
with you.
I am sure we are all looking forward to a fun expedition, and see you tomorrow!
take care,
Kim (Starseekers founder)

Shule, I'm sitting on the couch in the Control Room of William Dove. I have
Magellan, Sassie on a leash and a hoverpallet following me. I put the aquariums
onto the hoverpallet. please put the bed on the hoverpallet as well. I'd prefer
not to take William Dove to old Earth and it be there for all that long but if
you forget and take us there, it's ok. If you have any extra felo chow bowls or
troughs, please bring them along with any fish food you have or felo chow. I
have put an extra bag of chow in Maria Mitchell who is in your ship and I did a
felo feeding from the Repair shop so your felo will be taken care of. Purr is
setup with 4 bags of chow plus the fish food it has in case an aquarium is left
behind. please take a look around in William Dove and pick up anything you see
that I might have overlooked. The last thing I need to do is pick up some food
to bring. please bring any that you have time to get. I should be back no later
than 2300 and can easily pickup food. I'm just planning for contingencies in
case I over sleep. Love you, - Lily

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

the six-person A.S.S. frigate "Emerald McKay"
You see a frigate here.
"Emerald McKay" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "ASS-F1" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a white color with gunmetal grey trim. Its
laser turrets are blackened and outlined in gunmetal grey. The bays of its
minicannon launchers are dented and painted gunmetal grey. Its landing struts
are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a smooth dome on the forward end.

[Starship "Emerald McKay"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Auess I'll apply the duct tape."
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Blake Madison presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

[Starship "Wolf Pack"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a viral injection pylon launcher, a decoy beacon launcher, and a
wormhole drive tracer here.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

with a white flowered print. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
