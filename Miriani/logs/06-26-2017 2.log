00:01:23 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

00:02:31 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

00:03:23 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

00:17:24 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

00:19:23 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

00:20:11 Lily Kaise says, "Oorts everywhere."

00:20:21 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:20:39 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the ship has passed outside communications range.

00:20:43 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

00:21:24 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

00:23:24 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:23:31 You grin at Lily Kaise.

00:23:33 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

00:23:35 Lily Kaise grins.

00:23:53 You flip a heavy switch, activating the onboard beacon.

00:23:56 You flip a heavy switch, deactivating the onboard beacon.

00:23:58 You say, "Oops."

00:23:58 Lily Kaise says, "Um."

00:24:01 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:24:02 You say, "Wrong button."

00:24:05 You say, "Sorry."

00:24:06 You listen for a moment to the NDB pings from The Torus. They seem extremely loud. The signal strength meter reads: 91%.

00:24:06 You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They seem overwhelmingly loud. The signal strength meter reads: 97%.

00:24:15 Lily Kaise exclaims, "No prob!"

00:24:22 You laugh.

00:27:07 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

00:27:10 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:28:23 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the south.

00:28:24 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

00:28:30 You stroke the soft fur of Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo.

00:28:30 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

00:28:35 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

00:32:23 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches out.

00:33:20 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

00:33:30 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

00:35:32 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

00:35:51 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:37:58 Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:38:02 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

00:38:06 You smile at Lily Kaise.

00:38:15 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

00:38:34 Lily Kaise says, "We're still in range of 777."

00:39:22 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm just for curiosity, let's see if there's anything else."

00:39:39 Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.

00:39:39 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

00:39:48 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:40:08 Lily Kaise says, "J'still 777 and 776."

00:40:15 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

00:40:15 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:40:25 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:40:25 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:40:26 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:40:35 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

00:41:59 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

00:41:59 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 3523-8041 about 19.14 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northeast and Very Slightly Up.

00:48:28 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

00:48:28 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

00:50:08 I don't understand that.

00:50:11 You stroke the soft fur of Xavier the old big silver soldier felo.

00:50:11 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

00:50:16 You say to Xavier the old big silver soldier felo, "Hey buddy."

00:52:28 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo curls up and closes its eyes.

00:52:34 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo.

00:52:34 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

00:52:53 Lily Kaise puts a plain white spacesuit helmet in a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

00:56:28 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo rubs up against a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, purring softly.

01:00:28 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo jumps into Lily Kaise's lap and settles in, purring.

01:00:36 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo.

01:00:36 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

01:00:44 Lily Kaise hugs Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo.

01:00:49 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:01:28 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:06:47 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:07:03 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Come on give us another graveyard or hay planets!"

01:07:07 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:07:29 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

01:07:40 You grin.

01:08:29 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

01:08:35 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Mischief the large black felo.

01:08:35 Mischief the large black felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

01:08:47 I don't understand that.

01:08:54 You stroke the soft fur of Mischief the large black felo.

01:08:54 Mischief the large black felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

01:10:26 Many people march by on the shore, whipped and tormented by demons.

01:10:32 Lily Kaise says, "Eek."

01:10:40 Lily Kaise says, "I don't remember that one."

01:11:14 You say, "Oh, I think I've seen this riftscape before."

01:11:17 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

01:11:17 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 3523-8041 about 15.59 light-grand cycles toward Galactic East and Very Slightly Up.

01:11:47 Lily Kaise says, "Ah ok maybe I just tuned it out as it's so strange and disfunctional. Reminds me too much of dilusional Aisling."

01:11:51 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:12:05 You laugh.

01:19:29 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:20:29 Mischief the large black felo suddenly jumps onto a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:20:38 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:20:58 The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight with each other.

01:21:10 You say, "That... is disturbing."

01:21:19 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:21:33 Lily Kaise says, "Hurry on out of here weird riftscape."

01:21:35 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:21:40 You laugh and nod.

01:24:29 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

01:25:29 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

01:27:45 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:27:53 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:31:28 Many people march by on the shore, whipped and tormented by demons.

01:35:21 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

01:38:53 Lily says to you, "We've passed out of range of 777 or 776. There ain't no turning back!"

01:38:58 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:39:38 You laugh.

01:39:55 You say, "Well, at least I'm with my favorite woman in the universe. Let's get lost together."

01:39:58 Lily Kaise says, "Just kidding. We'll turn back in a couple of LTC."

01:40:16 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I need that lousy Constructor!"

01:40:26 You nod.

01:40:33 You say, "Well, at least I'm with my favorite woman in the universe. Let's get lost together."

01:40:44 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

01:41:00 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

01:41:04 Lily Kaise says, "It os soooo tempting but I don't think i'll try that this evening."

01:41:10 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

01:41:11 Lily Kaise says, "It is sooo."

01:41:43 Lily Kaise says, "We would have traveled farther but the flow was not in our favor."

01:43:51 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:43:55 Lily Kaise grins at you.

01:44:00 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:44:07 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:51:30 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:52:12 Lily Kaise activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

01:52:26 You activate the long-range scanner and search for passive detections and recent ping returns.

01:52:27 --
Passive Long-Range Scan

No sensor signatures detected. A PING using the active long range scanner may reveal more, but is also likely to reveal your own ship's position.

01:52:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

01:52:55 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Not likely to see anything but if we do... we might be a bit concerned!"

01:53:04 You nod.

02:00:37 Purr the humanoid service robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

02:00:40 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps south.

02:01:13 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.

02:01:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:07:18 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:07:25 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:11:01 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

02:11:11 You say to Lily, "I love you."

02:12:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

02:13:33 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:15:33 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

02:19:33 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

02:21:08 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

02:23:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

02:23:36 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

02:24:36 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo jumps down from Lily Kaise's lap.

02:24:42 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

02:25:37 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

02:27:36 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender.

02:28:15 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:28:27 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:28:37 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo jumps down from your lap.

02:28:37 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches out.
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

02:28:52 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Woo nothing and nothing and more nothingness!"

02:28:55 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:32:37 Mischief the large black felo seems to be hungry.

02:32:38 Mischief the large black felo approaches a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

02:33:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:34:10 Lily Kaise removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

02:34:15 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

02:34:24 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Hey there."

02:34:37 Lily Kaise helps herself to a slice of three-meat pizza.

02:34:41 Lily Kaise dangles a day old slice of three-meat pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

02:34:57 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

02:34:59 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

02:35:58 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:42:22 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

02:42:32 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

02:42:41 Lily Kaise says, "Woo I love this one."

02:42:46 You grin.

02:42:48 You exclaim, "Me too!"

02:42:52 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:42:56 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:43:01 You say to Lily, "I love you."

02:43:10 Lily Kaise smiles at you. "I love you too."

02:48:37 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches out.

02:49:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:49:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

02:52:37 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

02:53:18 Lily says to you, "Perhaps sometime we can venture out north and slightly up from the Torus and see if we can do any work on a couple of the sites we found out that way."

02:53:26 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:53:29 Lily Kaise grins.

02:53:29 You exclaim, "Let's!"

02:53:33 Lily Kaise giggles.

02:53:48 Lily Kaise says, "Might go even farther as I'd love to artifact in one of those other areas."

02:53:54 You smile.

02:54:16 Lily Kaise says, "Would be extra fun though if we could convince Eli and to come along."

02:54:27 You nod.

02:54:36 Lily Kaise says, "Or perhaps a couple others."

02:54:40 You grin.

02:55:55 Lily Kaise says, "Ok the standard NDB is 86 and it was 95 at 777 and the XL is 96 whereas was 98 in 777."

02:56:04 You nod.

03:00:38 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo jumps into Lily Kaise's lap and settles in, purring.

03:00:38 Mischief the large black felo jumps into Lily Kaise's lap and settles in, purring.

03:00:48 Lily Kaise says, "Ok I guess we probably need to turn back really soon."

03:01:30 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:01:38 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

03:01:38 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 270.0, -2.0.
You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

03:02:16 You say, "Ok."

03:04:37 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo rubs up against Mischief the large black felo, and both animals purr softly.

03:04:38 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

03:08:37 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

03:12:35 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

03:12:38 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches south.

03:19:38 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

03:20:19 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:20:25 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:20:30 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:20:38 Mischief the large black felo gazes at Xavier the old big silver soldier felo for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"

03:22:42 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

03:25:38 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

03:30:50 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:30:55 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:30:56 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 3523-8041 about 24.59 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southeast and Very Slightly Up.

03:31:21 You grin.

03:31:24 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:31:28 You listen for a moment to the NDB pings from The Torus. They seem very loud. The signal strength meter reads: 88%.

03:31:28 You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They seem overwhelmingly loud. The signal strength meter reads: 96%.

03:32:38 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo jumps down from Lily Kaise's lap.

03:32:43 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Xavier the old big silver soldier felo.

03:32:44 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

03:32:50 Lily Kaise hugs Xavier the old big silver soldier felo.

03:33:00 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Mischief the large black felo.

03:33:00 Mischief the large black felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

03:33:03 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

03:33:09 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

03:33:38 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

03:33:42 Lily Kaise says, "That is so gorgeous."

03:35:19 "That really is!" You grin.

03:35:31 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:42:38 Mischief the large black felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

03:43:28 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

03:44:04 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:44:07 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

03:44:08 Lily Kaise glides south.

03:44:16 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

03:44:17 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

03:44:24 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:57:52 Lily Kaise says, "So let's see."

03:57:56 Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.

03:57:56 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:58:01 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:58:12 Lily Kaise says, "There we go."

03:58:17 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:58:17 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 777."

03:58:19 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:58:29 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:58:29 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:58:30 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:58:32 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Now we're on cruise control!"

03:58:34 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:58:39 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

03:59:13 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:59:17 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:59:38 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

19:03:34 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "One beacon?"

19:04:32 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Battery-Powered Transmitter; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver cerami
19:04:32 c felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.

(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

19:04:33  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim black linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

19:04:33 You are carrying nothing.

19:04:42 You scramble to your feet.

19:05:56 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

19:05:58 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "No worries, everyone probably is."

19:05:58 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:05:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:05:59 You begin the launch sequence.

19:06:05 A launch trajectory is located.

19:06:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:06:13 The ship is already moving.

19:06:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:06:15 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 776. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

19:06:15 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:06:22 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I have a few left but not able to beacon right this second."

19:06:26 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

19:06:26 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:06:27 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:06:28 The starship has left a unique area of space.

19:06:36 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

19:06:49 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "If you are cool with a cipactli, I can wait a bit Caleb."

19:06:57 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Same here. I have beacons left, but I'm not available to do beacons right now."

19:37:28 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm trying to learn the art of smelling."

19:37:35 This will not work unless the ship is in a sector.

19:37:35 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:37:35 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

19:37:38 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

19:37:39 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Who you trying to impress?"

19:37:46 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

19:37:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:38:11 The starship transitions into another sector.

19:38:15 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

19:38:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:38:16 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

19:38:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:38:20 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:38:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

19:38:24 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:38:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:38:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:38:28 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:38:28 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:38:34 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

19:38:34 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Roid Seeker". The organization has earned 975,818.07 credits and 2 megacredits.

19:38:35 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:38:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:38:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:38:38 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:38:39 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

19:38:40 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:38:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:38:42 The starship is already moving.

19:38:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:38:43 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:39:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:39:14 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

19:39:17 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Give yourself more credit than that!"

19:39:17 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know Melinda what's your favorite scent?"

19:39:19 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

19:39:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

19:39:22 [General Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

19:39:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:39:29 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at Pengyou Homelife; Mail Room.

19:39:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hey, could I possibly get a ride from Accord to New Earth?"

19:39:42 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "She is allergic."

19:39:43 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs. "Not sweat."

19:40:14 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:40:14 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:43:23  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim black linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

19:43:24 You are carrying nothing.

19:43:50 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

19:43:56 Some lights on the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" suddenly flash several times.

19:44:00 The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

19:44:13 Eli Grey uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:44:14 You wave.

19:44:17 You say, "Thanks."

19:44:18 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

19:44:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:44:22 Eli Grey says, "No problem."

19:44:24 Eli Grey grins.

19:44:28 You grin.

19:44:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:44:29 Eli Grey presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

19:44:30 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:44:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:45:14 [Starship "Wandering Soul"; Control Room]

19:45:14 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

19:52:45 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Thank you."

19:53:03 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yup."

19:53:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure thing Eli."

19:54:55 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "25 minutes to get to the Bubble.. Man you guys are spiled."

19:55:01 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Spiled."

19:55:10 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Spoiled."

19:55:15 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Aww."

19:55:21 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. spoiled.. sorry I had something in my throat."

19:55:25 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Orion clear."

19:55:48 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Took me 26 to get here."

19:55:57 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "But that's just soooooooo long! I demand faster accelerators. Oh, and I want them to drop me right into an artifact so I don't have to go looking."

19:56:00 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "And that, my friends, is why I will not own a weaponless ship."

19:56:05 [General Communication] Jada Nelson giggles.

19:56:10 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Amen Melinda."

19:56:16 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Aww a weaponless ship, that can't be good."

19:56:24 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Ssn doesn't sell artifacts?"

19:56:24 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's too bad it doesn't at least have one anti-hazard laser on it."

19:56:39 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Even the capsule has at least one."

19:56:56 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Not like it be worth usin' though."

19:57:11 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "To destroy interdictors and get out, it would be just fine."

19:57:20 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "True that."

19:58:33 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I almost brought the sightseer to break it in, probably should have done that."

19:58:37 [General Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

19:58:42 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

19:58:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "When I was a brand new pilot, I wanted a void piercer. Now...I want nothin to do with 'em."

20:00:46 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ithink I mostly just like it because I remember when reactionless was all we had. So that extra fast reactionless speed just makes me super happy."

20:00:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

20:01:10 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Plus, it pierces voids, you know."

20:01:13 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Roid Seeker". The organization has earned 1,111,211.14 credits.

20:01:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm not too big into artifactin either, so there's that too."

20:01:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But mostly it's the total lack of weapons."

20:02:22 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yes, but going fast when piercing voids isn't everything. There's a time and a place. Best to go for stamina than speed, or it's over before you begin."

20:02:22 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm probably can't put a bolt cannon it, even if you could you can't target interdictors with those anywyas I wouldn't think."

20:02:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Johann that almost sounds dirty."

20:02:41 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I was just thinkin'. I mainly use my gemini for artifactin'. Might just switch it up to the unupgraded runabout, and use gem for GMG."

20:02:42 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You cannot put a bolt cannon in a piercer."

20:03:08 [General Communication] Johann Schraft snickers.

20:03:20 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Makes sense. Probably doesn't even have the targeting systems it would need."

20:05:00 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Greetings, galactic peoples."

20:05:05 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Hi."

20:05:10 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hello there tamra."

20:05:11 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo Tam."

20:05:16 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Hey there."

20:05:32 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "How goes it all? Decent here!"

20:05:44 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Pertty good."

20:05:45 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Not shabby, artifacting."

20:05:45 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Goes well here, you?"

20:05:49 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Nest bow, slow and quiet."

20:06:00 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson chuckles.

20:06:20 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Been teslaing at random points of the day."

20:09:01 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

20:09:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

20:09:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:09:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:09:05 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:09:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:09:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:09:20 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 189" has launched from New Earth.

20:09:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:09:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:09:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:09:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

20:09:34 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:09:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:09:37 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

20:09:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

20:09:41 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Kalina.' Welcome to Mir."

20:09:46 This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 5,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do you wish to pay this?

20:09:46 [Enter `yes' or `no']

20:09:48 You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

20:09:48 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 998,942.48 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 777. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

20:09:58 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

20:09:58 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

20:10:08 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

20:21:51 This will not work unless the ship is in a sector.

20:22:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire laughs.

20:22:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ouch man."

20:22:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sorry about that I just thought you would stay put until I got back."

20:23:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh no worries. I wasn't sure when you were going to head back so I figured I'd get both ships home for us."

Note: Not all spaceports possess the starship locator function.

20:54:19 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

20:54:19 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

20:54:22 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

20:54:26 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

20:54:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:54:59 The starship transitions into another sector.

20:55:00 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

20:55:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:55:01 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

20:55:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:55:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:55:05 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

20:55:08 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:55:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:55:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:55:11 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:55:12 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

20:55:12 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

20:55:13 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:55:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:55:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:55:16 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:55:17 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

20:56:53 --

20:56:53 Dear Shule,
I apologize for the lack of communication on my part. I haven't taken piloting as seriously as I might, or communications. So today I resolved to do something about that. *smiles* Thanks for saying I look cute. That was very sweet of you! You seem fairly good looking and yyou have a great sense of yourself. Not afraid to banter or be silly but serious when the situation warrents. Well, take care of yourself. If you are still giving away felo i'm still interested. I just paid my phone bill so i'm a phone call away. Have yourself a lovely day and safe venturings throughout the galaxy!
Signed,
Tamra.

23:52:18 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

23:52:20  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim black linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

23:52:20 You are carrying Mischief the large black felo in your right hand.
