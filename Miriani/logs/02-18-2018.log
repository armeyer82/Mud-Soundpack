00:07 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the one-person fighter "Flying Solo", the one-person expediter "No Big Thing", the six-person destroyer "Undertow", and the six-person destroyer "Dark Desires" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Chitter the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, Beta the droid, Alphy the droid, Mjolnir the droid, Strike the droid, and Sinister the droid here.
You can go northwest, east, and southwest.

07:58 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (dozing) (sitting on a dark blue suede co-captain's chair) here.
You can go south.

07:58 No such player could be found.

07:58 Katrianne Beauchene (A) (Female) is awake!

07:58 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

07:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

07:58 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

07:58 Cria Blur (H) (Male) is asleep!

07:58 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

07:58 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

07:58 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

07:58 You're already sitting down.

07:58 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

07:58 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

07:58 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

07:58 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

07:58 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

07:59 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

07:59 A clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener freshens the room with the scent of Desolian Sunshine.

07:59 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

07:59 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

07:59 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

07:59 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

07:59 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

07:59 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

07:59 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

07:59 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

07:59 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

07:59 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

07:59 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

07:59 I don't understand that.

07:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

07:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

07:59 The starship is already moving.

07:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

07:59 A small console nearby flashes for your attention. A quick glance reveals that you have new mail waiting for you at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Entryway.

07:59 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

07:59 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

08:02 Dear Tibo,
We have approved your party chef. In future, please be sure you test each menu item to make sure everything is in order before submitting the design. Please use a spell checker in future, and make sure proper nouns are capitalized. Your menu contained twenty-one items, one over the limit. We removed the garnish plates and consolidated that item with the garnish platters to get your menu down to the required twenty item limit.
Your chef menu required a tremendous amount of editing, and we will not be doing this in future. Not only were there spelling and capitalization errors, but the names of your multislices and all the descriptions had to be edited. The containers on your multislices were incorrectly done as well. We will not be testing and editing in this much detail in future. This is why the lab allows you to thoroughly test each menu item in detail before it reaches us.
Please assist if you find any menu errors. We will correct errors if something isn't displaying properly. However, we won't be setting plates to 0 or correcting any other minor changes that were neglected due to lack of player testing.
We look forward to seeing quality work from you in future.

My challenge was for a vanguard on vanguard. I'm not going to let you set the terms for a duel I suggested. I have no way of varifying that what you say about when you graduated is true. All I know is that I heard that you have, and I quote, "been around for quite a few months. I am also perfectly justified in calling you a worm when you're brave specifically when you're up against less experienced pilots. I will also not fight you in a vanguard if you're in a fighter. That's plain unsportsmanlike. You can either make a plan to get a vanguard, or you forfit.

08:52 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "Stop trying to set terms for a duel I suggested. Are you, are are you not going to do vanguards on vanguards? That is the challenge. If you're not, then clearly you forfit."

08:52 [Chatter] Blotto Hendrix transmits, "Stay the fuck out of my way or I will crush you. Hunt me if you have any action behind your words. Learn your place taleila castle. If you can't bear the thought of a duel with a vanguard and a second person aginst me in a fighter, what do you think you are going to accomplish."

08:55 [Chatter] Blotto Hendrix transmits, "Well I don't have a second, I don't intend to get a second, and I don't have a vanguard, nor do I intend to get a vanguard. I stole some ship which apparently offends you, and if you won't duel me either in a 1 on 1 duel or in a vanguard to fighter duel, then we won't duel."

08:55 [Chatter] Blotto Hendrix transmits, "You can hunt me, I don't care. You have proven to me that you have no ability to do anything."
