[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: Can you get any of the droids in the landing
strip to follow you?
[Miriani] [Newbie] Tiberius Black: If you own them yes.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Amena Wolf: Only if they are your droids.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Katherine Tolliver: You have to have enough points for them.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: How can you buy droids and where?
[Miriani] [Newbie] Jason Harkness: Not unless you have the points for a droid,
you're authorized to them, or you own them.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: Okay thank you.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Sarah Arons: Buy them at zander.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: Where's that?
[Miriani] #$#hjelp
[Miriani] [Newbie] Jason Harkness: That's something you could ask in character
over either general or chatter. But Zander is in sector twelve.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: Thanks. :)
[Miriani] [Newbie] Amena Wolf: Haven, you need fifteen hundred points to obtain
a droid, and you buy them at Zander which is in sector twelve. I believe you
need fifteen hundred license points, which you can obtain a variety of different
ways, and I have unfortunately forgotten how many combat, which you obtain
through fighting praelor.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Dorion Hunter: It's no combat.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Jason Harkness: 1500 license points, none for medical droids,
10 for security.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: Oh. Okay I have no points yet lols. I can't even
figure out how to get to my ship.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Jason Harkness: Ahem, no combat and ten combat respectively.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Amena Wolf: You'd find it in Angelus's garage, or on
angelus's landing. You can get there by mapping them.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: Okay thanks.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Amena Wolf: Not a problem.
[Miriani] #$#hjelp
[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: I have a key but I can't find my ship and I keep
getting turned away I'm so confused.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Jason Harkness: Is your key on a keyring?
[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: Yes.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: Try slocate and then your ship's name. You
can then type map landing to get you to the landing pad.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Jason Harkness: What are you typing to enter your ship?
[Miriani] [Newbie] Haven Maise: Thanks And sorry for asking so many questions. I
just got an account on here last night.
[Miriani] [Newbie] Amena Wolf: Ask as many as you like! Happy to answer.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sleeveless pastel purple cotton top with a three-button front
and v-neck trimmed with tiny embroidered flowers, a pair of tight light blue
denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket, and
a pair of tan suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', a light pink
linen bag, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands
are left uncovered.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

Date -- 1/4/2317
Liam,
This is one more attempt to provide an accomodation for your organization on
organization sponsored temporary space stations.
I have room for an Ejecter on a Salvage processing and an Asteroid processing
station. The Salvage processing station is currently located in Asteroid Alpha
285 and alternates with Artifact Alpha 777. The Asteroid processor is located in
Asteroid Alpha 285 and provides fairly consistent Megacredits and an occasional
Command point as well as reasonable cash flow. The Salvage processing station
will expire early Saturday morning or 1/7. The replacement will be placed in
Artifact Alpha 777 which has grade 20 to 40 Shipwrecks. This obviously isn't
extremely high grade debris but pilots do find there is a consistent occurance
of grade 40. Still, alternating the salvage processor is an experiment to
determine which of the two areas pilots prefer for obtaining salvage. Therefore,
for the time being, we plan to alternate placing the salvage processor between
Artifact Alpha 777 and Asteroid Alpha 285.
I am enclosing a key to my Module Transport, Building Capital. We use the least
expensive Ejecter which is the Unmanned Pickup. These cost one Megacredit or 5
million EAOS credits. If you would like to participate, please place 2 to 4 of
an Unmanned Pickup ejecter module aboard Building Capital and we will accomodate
Eternal Freedom. At this time, I don't have another organization who is seeking
a slot on these stations and if I don't obtain parts from Eternal Freedom, then
one organization will have to double up on providing parts which works but
unnecessary duplication.
Best regards,
Lily Kaise

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

gave out?"
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "It was a derelict when it
was first discovered, wasn't it?"
[General Communication] Harper Dragomir transmits, "What split?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "There was an alien ship found
abandoned by the Gray Expedition a couple of years ago. It ran off with some of
Gray's crew when they poked around in it, and landed itself on a derelict space
station full of aquatic life."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches south.
[General Communication] Skyler Phenac transmits, "Wow."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "That ship has been sitting in
the derelict station for some time. Months ago we visited it again, and I poked
around and cleaned up some of it to try to make it a suitable living space for
the aquatic lifeforms in the derelict station."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "So are they sayin' the
station is split, or the ship?"
[General Communication] Skyler Phenac snickers. "A starship fish tank."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "They're saying the ship split
apart."
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo marches in from the south.

A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles

[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "When the ship was originally
found it had eggs from a couple of different species on it. The Gray expedition
crew took those. When Pierre and I revisited it, I put those same species of
eggs in the ship again and did some other stuff that seemed like it might help
the ship become a good environment for the eggs."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The ship falling apart is a
little sad, but it was a dead thing when we visited the station before. Maybe
it's trying to reproduce like Pierre suggested, or maybe it just fell apart like
Damien says."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If it broke up, it's part of the
station environment now and scavengers can pick it apart and its parts can
dissolve into the station environment over time."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If it's reproducing, that's
wildly better than I could have hoped for."
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo marches south.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.
[General Communication] Skyler Phenac transmits, "If the ship is reproducing by
itself that's a bit worrysome if you ask me. How can a dead ship make more of
itself. Unless there's some sort of rat-like technology on it or some other
alien technology we're not aware of?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It's a biological ship."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The derelict station was some
sort of facility for making starships and bioenhancement plants for starships."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Or maybe just for the latter.
We're not sure."
[General Communication] Skyler Phenac transmits, "Oh. What's the ship made out
of I wonder that it can reproduce then."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The bioenhancement plants we
install on our ships came from there, though."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "So that ship itself is the
Aquarium?"
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I've never been there so
I've never actually seen it in person."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The derelict station is called
the Aquarium sometimes, but the ship is just "that ship" or "the derelict ship""
[General Communication] Skyler Phenac transmits, "Probably not anything we can
do, but wait and see what happens I'm guessing?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It was a big sphere, a huge open
area for a ship, with a bunch of twisting corridors of a coral-like material
trailing off the end."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "From afar it looked kind of like
a grape."
[General Communication] Skyler mutters, "Alien grape.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The corridors had an airlock
system that still responded to being touched, and there was a coral structure in
the sphere area that was similar to a control console."
[General Communication] Skyler Phenac transmits, "Uh wow. Sounds pretty and
creepy at the same time."
A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and
a violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea
fern.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The interior of the sphere had
gotten covered in much and slime over time, but it was probably mostly
transparent once."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I spent awhile with a sonic
cleanliness enforcer knocking as much muck off of surfaces as I could."
[General Communication] Skyler Phenac transmits, "But if that ship was under
water, then maybe those sonic waves mixed with that slime mixed with, what ever
that ship is made out of, had some sort of adverse affect."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I picked the sonic clanliness
enforcer because it's easy to control and very gentle. You can use it on people
and not hurt them."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The slime is basically a kind of
algae that collected because there was nothing around to keep it in check."
Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo marches in from the south.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It's endemic to the derelict
station, but in most of the station it doesn't get nearly so thick because there
are critters that eat it."

[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "News about the derelict ship
Kim."

[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What, the ship broke? Oh my."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "They reported that it was in two
sections, the sphere section and the rest of it."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "They couldn't figure out how to
board either half."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Wo."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Which means the old airlock
wasn't working, I guess."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The last time some of us
boarded it, we left eggs there?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Poor fish if they ever
hatched."
