01:07 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:07 [Private | Katrianne Beauchene] Katrianne Beauchene transmits, "she seems to be toog! ok going to go put swim suit on and go in the pool for a bit. Love you!"

01:07 Meredeth Lancaster's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "set yourselves up please"

01:07 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:08 [Private | Katrianne Beauchene] You transmit, "Awesome."

01:08 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:08 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:08 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:08 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:08 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:08 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:08 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:08 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:08 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

Her shoulder-length, light golden brown hair is pulled up in to a high ponytail. She has expressive hazel eyes with a button nose above brilliantly white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a bright red and blue energy field.
For a top, she is wearing a form fitting red leather blouse with a holographic design of black storm clouds drifting across the front over a soft black lace strapless bra with a small golden bell dangling from the center of each cup. For a bottom, she is wearing a knee-length flowing red velvet skirt which appears to be made out of rippling water over a pair of soft black lace panties with a black rose on the front. She is wearing a pair of high heeled red sturdy leather high heels which gleam with a highly reflective polish on her feet. She is also wearing a small keyring, a message board reader, a black communicator, a silver ring with the Commonwealth logo engraved on it, a black portable point unit, a black velvet backpack with metallic holographic flames streaking across it, an asteroid hauling kit, a black flight control scanner, a rigid black leather stun weapon holster, a black ammunition container, a compac

13:22 #$#soundpack_pong

13:22 #$#soundpack_lag 112

13:22 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "Aside from debris salvaging stuff."

13:22 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Hull, slip, relativity, storage one and two, debris scanner, then if you want, laser focus, the pulses, maybe a GMU."

13:22 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Maybe even enhanced sensors."

13:23 #$#soundpack_pong

13:23 #$#soundpack_lag 116

13:24 #$#soundpack_lag 107

13:24 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "I have one, but I mainly just store my roid mining stuff in it. I've got a dart, which has more storage space when upgraded, not to mention subwarp and a better wormhole range."

13:24 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Also better weapons, and more of them."

13:24 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "I do love subwarp."

13:25 #$#soundpack_pong

13:25 #$#soundpack_lag 115

13:25 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Oh I forgot. Maybe airlock chime and cycle time. Those don't cost that much."

13:25 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Oh maybe the long range scanner range and direction things, and navi."

13:27 #$#soundpack_pong

13:27 #$#soundpack_lag 109

13:27 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Other than that, I can't think of anything that would be worth getting for a freighter except charge transfer couplings. But then, I tend to get that for all my ships just on the off chance I need it. It's good for out of local space travel. You can be carrying your fighter with you, and they have good charge, but you need to top them back off when they get low, so..."

13:27 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "Oh right I forgot about those."

13:30 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Oh, and once you reach 31k points, I'd get the slip enhancement. A freighter only has slip, not subwarp, so may as well enhance its recharge time anyway."

13:30 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "Which store is it again that sells the airlock chimes?"

13:30 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Keyton's airlock... Thinggy."

13:31 #$#soundpack_pong

13:31 #$#soundpack_lag 118

13:31 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "Also, why's that particularly necessary? I mean you'd be aware when someone breaches your airlock, right?"

13:31 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "It's not strictly necessary. When it comes to strictly necessary, I listed the most important ones first when we started talking, I think, so slip, hull, storage increasers, and rel."

13:32 #$#soundpack_pong

13:32 #$#soundpack_lag 123

13:32 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "But to answer you, yeah that's what the chime does."

13:33 #$#soundpack_pong

13:33 #$#soundpack_lag 101

13:43 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "Why's that?"

13:44 [Chatter] Yara Skye transmits, "It's like starting level 1 all over again. It doesn't detect objects that are very far down, so in the end I just have to use level 4 anyway."

13:44 #$#soundpack_pong

13:44 [Chatter] Yara Skye transmits, "Yes and thank you for that advice, sure would have been upset if I didn't."

13:44 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "But sometimes five will see stuff, so go for the five first. It makes things a smidgen faster."

13:45 #$#soundpack_pong

13:45 #$#soundpack_lag 104

13:45 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Also, if I remember rightly, five is indeed directional, but only up to a unit away. Six is probably two, 7 might be 3... Eventually level 10 sees about 7 units away."

13:46 #$#soundpack_pong

13:46 #$#soundpack_lag 95

13:46 [Chatter] Yara Skye transmits, "Yeah, it's annoying. It takes you all over the place and in the end you walk right over objects that are further down and detectible with level 4. Just ranting, definitely not ungreatful."

13:47 #$#soundpack_lag 107

13:47 [Chatter] Tom Tucker chuckles and transmits, "Believe me. I feel your pain. I don't know why I kept my four. Maybe I wanted to test if five was worth it. I'm definitely glad I did. I'd have gotten a nasty surprise."

13:50 #$#soundpack_pong

13:50 #$#soundpack_lag 151

13:50 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Keep the 4 until you get to 7, I think. Maybd 8."

13:50 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Maybe."

13:50 [Chatter] Yara Skye transmits, "At this point I just use 4. It takes longer, but is more thurrow and detects objects further down. I think that is my best bet."

13:51 #$#soundpack_pong

13:51 #$#soundpack_lag 92

13:51 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "Use the five, six, seven, and eight, but keep in mind the four is going t detect better at depth. It's just that after 4, you start getting directional."

13:51 [Chatter] Yara Skye transmits, "Thanks for your advice! It sure is very helpful."

13:51 [Chatter] Alexander Martellato transmits, "I would do what Tom said. I didn't when I started, but that was just because I didn't know jack. I quickly moved to 5 because I wanted the directional, from 5 I went to 8, then 9, to 10 and finally 11."

17:09 [Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Master Bedroom] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood king pillowtop bed)
You see nothing special.
You see a wicker dresser, a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a rosewood king pillowtop bed, an antique teak nightstand with a neon purple lily scented candle sitting on top of it, a seashell-shaped ocean blue Hawaiian ginger air freshener, a mauve suede settee, a pair of matte lavender purple silk high heels, and a pair of gray sneakers with red laces here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (dozing) (lying on a rosewood king pillowtop bed) here.

22:48 [Newbie] Drew Berry: I believe it is based on number of hits per ship, instead of actual kill.

22:48 [Newbie] Anara Webster: Er...

22:48 [Newbie] Michael Calaway: Yes, it's number of hits per ship.
