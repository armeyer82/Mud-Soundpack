18:03 ["Starlight Express" Living Quarters 1] (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.
You can go southeast.

19:56 [Newbie] Richard Aubery: Thanks for that.

19:57 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: In future, you can also search everything you have on you, including inside containers, by typing, 'inv (keyword).' For example, inv asteroid. This will show you what items you have matching that keyword and their location on your person.
