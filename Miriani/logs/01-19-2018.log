["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

20:28 [Newbie] Saul Delano: Is there a way to see cordinates when you pull up autopilot. Like it would read debris _1, 1, 1)

20:29 #$#soundpack_pong

20:29 #$#soundpack_lag 112

20:29 [Newbie] Ivan Cardenas: Condence auto piolot turned off, type options and look for the settings for the ship your in.

20:29 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Look at the starmap, or scan?

20:29 Kitty Mars glides in from down.

20:29 Kitty Mars lies down on you.

20:30 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: I'm a little confused on what you're asking.

20:31 #$#soundpack_pong

20:31 #$#soundpack_lag 230

20:31 [Newbie] Saul Delano: When you type move and autopilot comes up so that you can choose your destination. Is there a way to make it read 1.) debris (1, 1, 1) with all that information on each line.

20:32 #$#soundpack_pong

20:32 #$#soundpack_lag 120

20:32 [Newbie] Ivan Cardenas: He's asking if there's a way for the auto piolot to show the coordenates before moving to it. If you go to your ships settings, you'll see what your looking for.

20:32 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Nope. You could scan it though.

20:32 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Is there such a thing then? Wasnt aware. Let me know when you find such.

20:33 #$#soundpack_pong

20:33 #$#soundpack_lag 103

20:33 [Newbie] Alycen Hunter: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's in ship-o. Number 2 iI believe. If I'm understanding you right.

20:33 [Newbie] Ivan Cardenas: Yes, its options, then 6, then 2.

20:33 [Newbie] Saul Delano: Thank you.

21:14 Kitty Mars
She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This thin woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
She is wearing an elegant deep purple antique lace negligee glittering with tiny diamonds.  She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a pink flight control scanner, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a long necklace made of smoothly polished light purple amethyst stones, a handmade ring made of amethyst and multi-colored stones, a cute tortie cat backpack, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a pink armor storage bag, a pink stun armor storage bag, a high-capacity pink Lore computer, a deep purple
21:14  leather briefcase, a violet rolled toolkit, a purple diving gear bag, a small handheld radio receiver, a sleek hot pink repair kit, an asteroid hauling kit, a multi-strand of iridescent strawberry pearls, a seashell pink friendship bracelet with kitten-shaped beads, a silver ring with an amethyst gemstone, an amethyst crystal butterfly, a diamond Commoveo membership ring, a violet spacesuit jet, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a purple velvet artifact storage container, a bright pink snuggly holding an orange and white cat, and a small handheld mineral scanner.
She is carrying nothing.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles.
