Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top,
Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, Shule
Elemmire's workbench, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a

Star Conquest Help: Bounty Hunting
--
Category: Activities
--
There are two types of bounty hunting.  The first is accomplished simply by
destroying enemy ships, which will gain you a profit depending on the relations
of your alliance and the other ship's, as well as the type of ship destroyed. 
In wartime, the bounty from destroying enemy ships is often enough to fund your
personal war effort, with the possibility of a bit of profit on the side.
The second type of bounty hunting involves capturing people wanted for certain
offenses.  As of this writing, the two main offenses that you're likely to
capture someone for is transporting contraband and illegal starship
modification.  If you see a ship containing contraband or if you suspect that it
is illegally modified, you can TAG it for a bounty hunt.  You then have 24 hours
to capture the ship's owner and turn him or her into a security office in the
same area of space where the offense was committed, which can be found on any
capital planet.  Simply stun the pilot, go to a security office, and ARREST him
or her to collect your bounty.  Starships that are carrying illegal goods or are
illegally modified are not protected by local navies or militia as long as the
good or modification is illegal within their jurisdiction.
List of Commands
* TAG: Scan a ship for illegal items and produces a bounty hunt tag. Only works
in Gamma or more secure space.
* ARREST: At a security office, arrest a subdued offender and collect your
reward.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The two-person Accord gemini "Gtr Beni Gittiin Yere", the eight-person prime

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
~iM2,-yYY'a)BJg?WT9%!<tc}4u|}3giYj~f+We4
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

ftl second battle
Once the frontier of Known Space for many years, the Borderlands region is now a
settled area of space, though rather poor compared to most others. A handful of
beacons indicate the positions of clouds of debris, but a nearby star indicates
a solar system may also be in this cluster.
A beacon has been placed trailing the orbit of Candelaria, a waypoint on the way
to and from deeper space.
trace
This beacon lies along the path of the local solar system's galactic orbit. Dust
and debris has been pulled in its wake, leaving a funnel-shaped void.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at EAOS Asteroid Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top,
Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and
Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[Starship "Creature Of The Night"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in a wormhole.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather
captain's chair with a sleeping obese red soldier felo on it, a crudely hammered

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay One.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a short-sleeved white cotton top trimmed with tiny embroidered
flowers, a pair of blue low rise denim jeans, and a pair of baby blue leather
clogs with a row of multicolored daisies across the toes. She is also wearing an
orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone
in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both
elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying a slice of chocolate cream pie in her right hand, and a large
crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio in her
left hand.

This is a tank for holding critters!
It is filled with water.
It is closed.
Inside it you see a black plastic undersea castle and a small plastic statue of
a bikini-clad mermaid.
It appears that there are ample food particles in the water.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with crimson skin and violet round wings, a

"Sukoshi" is written along its hull in flaming silver letters.
The designation "CMX-376-III" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing
struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a deep blue color with red trim. Its laser
turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in red. Its landing struts
are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a metallic silver small decorative chain near the landing struts and a
metallic silver antenna on the top.

This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
