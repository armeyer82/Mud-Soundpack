02:09 --------------------------------------------------
Player-owned Space Stations, Moons, and Planets
--------------------------------------------------
PLANETS, MOONS, AND SPACESTATIONS:
Q: What do I need to get a planet, moon, or spacestation?
A: For spacestations, you need 10 billion credits and 10000 points. For moons, you need 20 billion credits and 15000 points. For planets, you need 30 billion credits and 25000 points. You also pay additional fees for each room you add.
Q: Where can I put my spacestation, planet, or moon?
A: In any sector, including places out of local space, except sector 24, sector 15, sector 12, sector 9, sector 13, sector 19, sector 0, sector 30, sector 115, sector 14 and sector 32. These sectors are subject to change and can be added to at any time.
Q: What can these fine places have?!
A: They can have an optional pool, an optional hot tub, and an optional private garage. You also may have a security center which allows you to control flight control and monitor rooms on the station, planet, or moon. You can also have a room that monitors the sector around your station, planet, or moon. Additionally, you're allowed to have five custom item stores for a station, seven custom item stores for a moon, and nine custom item stores for a planet. Any additional stores will have to be a tradesman item. Custom item stores are defined as stores with special clothing, food or other collectable items. You may have a transport pod as long as the station, planet, or moon is not out of local space. Player-owned space stations, planets, and moons cannot contain facilities that allow for point transfers to take place, including artifact research centers, passenger transport facilities, etc. Stations, planets and moons cannot be self-contained. This means you cannot design a station that eliminates your need to travel to other planets to obtain specific services or goods. Example: starship registries.
Q: Can my station be armed?!?!
A: Sorry, no.
Q: Can I keep people out of my station, planet, or moon?
A: You can control flight control which will deny docking to a whole alliance, everybody but owners and caretakers, or specific ships based on your choice. If landing is disabled to all, even the ITPN station becomes non-functional.
Q: ITPN Stations??! Oh my oh my! What do they entail?!
A: All private space stations, moons and planets are required to have an ITPN station on them. These stations cannot be past a security checkpoint, meaning that everybody has to be able to get to them. ITPN stations may have only a single destination. The destination is determined by the sector that your private space station, moon or planet is in. If there is already a planet, moon or station in the sector you are building in, your ITPN destination goes to that location. Otherwise, the ITPN pod will go to the sector hub. That's Pax for sectors 1 through 20, and the ITPN hub in sector 33 for sec
02:09 tors 21 through 40. An example would be if a person build a moon in sector 31. There is a planet there with an ITPN station already, so the one on the private moon would go to that planet, which would then go to the hub. Private space stations, moons and planets not in a numbered sector can not have an ITPN station.

02:43 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta] (indoors)
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.

The massive antechamber stands several stories tall and is lavishly and comfortably decorated. The ground is covered in a lush green carpet which serves to dampen the footsteps of the people who come and go through the antechamber. In the very center of the room, several differently colored fibers have been integrated into the carpet to form the logo of the Alliance High Guard, a large circle in which the three alliances are all represented. The walls of the room each represent a different alliance: The northern wall is dominated by a large logo for the Hale Collective, the eastern wall a logo for the Commonwealth of Free Spirits, and the western wall a logo for the Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists. The southern and outer wall displays three rings: indigo for AIE, cyan for Commonwealth, and gray for Hale, all connected to each other at the bottom with a single golden ring which represents the Alliance High Guard. A number of desks line the walls, providing information and services to people who seek it.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.

03:24 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.
You see the six-person sentinel "Nightingale", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", and the one-person fighter "Javelin" landed here.
You see Dee the droid, Tausha the droid, Yowl the droid, Boomer the droid, Scrappy the droid, Karalyn the droid, Cletus the droid, Sameer the droid, Jessicapops the droid, Delta the droid, Chander the droid, and Dixy the droid here.

03:27 [Short-range Communication] Cody Meynoso transmits, "I have the urge to explore violent urges right now."

03:27 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

03:27 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

03:27 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

03:27 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

03:27 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

03:27 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

03:27 The ship must be in space to do that.

03:27 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

03:27 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

03:27 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

03:54 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

03:54 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

03:54 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

03:55 You say, "me too"

03:55 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

03:55 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

03:55 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

03:55 Cody Meynoso strolls south.

03:55 A glossy black security drone, a glossy red medical drone, Careless the droid, and Aaron the droid leave the area behind Cody Meynoso.

hi all, oh well i've had to mute my channels on my communicator's, for i'm only asking for help with something, and all i'm getting is constant words of complete and utter bad stuff. i feel threatened on some of the words, i'm only asking for help and i was called alot of names, some wich i don't like, and i was classed as a 72 years old man when i'm 21 and only have various types of computer opperating systems. all i asked was i need to get a good working soundpack for vipmud. i've tried finding some but not having much luck. i'm now not sure if i can go any where now in caise i'm either grabbed from behind, or thrown bombs in my direction. and i dread to think what'll happen to me when i post this. i don't want to be band and i'm trying to explain everything as i can. might be hard, but talking with someone as well can also help out. i don't no what else i'm to do now.

Dearest James,
I can certainly understand why gabe asking if you were 72 is a threat. Indeed, it triggered me and
 had me running for a safe space.
Such threats aren't to be taken lightly. A 72 year old man would be one wrinkley bastard, and that
 I just couldn't handle.
I also understand your urge to talk about your various computer operating systems. Sometimes I
 can't help but drool over the stunning beauty of windows 98. The ladies find it weird, but noone
 understands me quite like you do.
Please be ware of being grabbed behind by creepy males with hatch bombs. It's almost, dare I say it
 as scary as being called 72.
PS, please read the README.txt file found within the directory structure of your VIP mud soundpack
 download.
Love,
Bob

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:47 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:47 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:47 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

12:47 The ship is already moving.

12:47 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:47 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:47 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:47 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:47 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

12:47 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:47 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

12:47 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:47 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:47 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:16 --------------------------------------------------
Couriering
--------------------------------------------------
To become a courier, you must first decide which courier company you'd like to work for. There are currently courier companies on Miriani, Outreach, Acrylon, Pluto, Aquatimis, Narth Polus, Shadius, Io, Luna, and Quazicol. Each courier company delivers different goods. This list could change, as new companies spring up from time to time, so be sure to explore! 
To start couriering, you will need to REGISTER in the lobby of your courier company. After registering, go to the company's starship request center and REQUEST a ship. Once you have your ship, you will then need to locate your company's cargo request room and REQUEST cargo for delivery. There are two types of deliveries that you can make: one is regular, the other is high priority. You get less money, but more rating points for high priority deliveries.
Once you have your delivery, you need to enter the ship that you were lent by the courier company (it will be on the landing pad), and use it to fly to the delivery planet. If you forget where you need to go you can type DESTINATION in the courier ship. If you forget what company you work for, or what the ship number is that you were lent, you can find that information by typing INFO. When you land on the planet, you will need to DELIVER the cargo, and you will receive a message saying how long the delivery took.
The faster you are when you deliver goods, the more rating points you will receive. You will be paid every Friday for all courier work done during the week. To confirm payment, courier companies will send you a payment slip in the mail that will tell you the amount you made that week. If you'd prefer not to receive these payment slips, you can type OPTOUT in the lobby of your courier company. Should you ever change your mind, you can similarly OPTIN to opt back in.
Once you have enough rating points, you will be eligible for promotions in the company. Promotions will get you eligible for an upgraded courier ship. You can check out the specifics of different ships by checking the INFO in the starship acquisition center. You will be allowed to get other, previous ships that you earned besides the one you were recently promoted to for a fee.
If you decide you'd like to change courier companies, you have two options. The first, if your record is in good standing, is to go to another courier company's lobby and type TRANSFER. If all goes well, you should have your employment transferred to the new company. If not, you can try again another day. The second option is to go to the lobby of the courier company that you currently work for, and END or QUIT your position. You will then be able to REQUEST at a different company. ** NOTE ** When you change courier companies using this method, you will lose all rating points gained through previous employment.
If you are unabl
13:16 e to complete a courier assignment then type QUIT or ABANDON in the courier cargo assignment room. You will lose rating points equal to two deliveries of the same kind, but you will be able to select a new cargo, which will hopefully be bound for a place that you can reach.
A few commands you'll want to know: @couriers, @courier-rank, @courier-speed
Also worth noting is that, if you destroy the courier starships of rival companies, your company will reward you with a decent amount of courier rating points. However, be aware that destroying ships from your own company will get you nothing but trouble and heartache.
If you yourself lose a courier ship, you will be required to pay for the cost of the ship that you lost. This will put you in some debt that can be paid off at your nearest ATM. When you request a new courier ship from your company, you will also be required to pay THAT cost, as the company will not subsidize the cost of a new ship without a promotion. It's also worth noting that courier ship destructions will count against you should you attempt to transfer to a new company.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

14:27 Passenger Transports
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Passenger transports allow you to take several people into your ship and ferry them to other locations. If they're satisfied with the speed of the move, they will reward you accordingly.
  Obtaining Passengers:
To obtain passengers, visit a passenger transport facility and type REQUEST.
  Determining Destination:
To figure out where each passenger wants to go, talk to them. If, say, you're transporting a dirty man, you would type TALK TO DIRTY MAN. He will then present you with a menu of conversation topics, one of which should be "Where are you going?"
  Dropping Passengers Off:
Dropping the passengers off is a simple matter of landing on the planet they wish to go or docking with a space station. They will automatically pay you (assuming you're in the control room) and leave the ship.
  Aborting:
Should you decide you no longer wish to transport the passengers, you can type DISMISS <passenger name> to dismiss them from your ship. You must be landed to do this.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

[2] Tops Lists
Enter your selection:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

14:54 --------------------------------------------------
Couriering
--------------------------------------------------
To become a courier, you must first decide which courier company you'd like to work for. There are currently courier companies on Miriani, Outreach, Acrylon, Pluto, Aquatimis, Narth Polus, Shadius, Io, Luna, and Quazicol. Each courier company delivers different goods. This list could change, as new companies spring up from time to time, so be sure to explore! 
To start couriering, you will need to REGISTER in the lobby of your courier company. After registering, go to the company's starship request center and REQUEST a ship. Once you have your ship, you will then need to locate your company's cargo request room and REQUEST cargo for delivery. There are two types of deliveries that you can make: one is regular, the other is high priority. You get less money, but more rating points for high priority deliveries.
Once you have your delivery, you need to enter the ship that you were lent by the courier company (it will be on the landing pad), and use it to fly to the delivery planet. If you forget where you need to go you can type DESTINATION in the courier ship. If you forget what company you work for, or what the ship number is that you were lent, you can find that information by typing INFO. When you land on the planet, you will need to DELIVER the cargo, and you will receive a message saying how long the delivery took.
The faster you are when you deliver goods, the more rating points you will receive. You will be paid every Friday for all courier work done during the week. To confirm payment, courier companies will send you a payment slip in the mail that will tell you the amount you made that week. If you'd prefer not to receive these payment slips, you can type OPTOUT in the lobby of your courier company. Should you ever change your mind, you can similarly OPTIN to opt back in.
Once you have enough rating points, you will be eligible for promotions in the company. Promotions will get you eligible for an upgraded courier ship. You can check out the specifics of different ships by checking the INFO in the starship acquisition center. You will be allowed to get other, previous ships that you earned besides the one you were recently promoted to for a fee.
If you decide you'd like to change courier companies, you have two options. The first, if your record is in good standing, is to go to another courier company's lobby and type TRANSFER. If all goes well, you should have your employment transferred to the new company. If not, you can try again another day. The second option is to go to the lobby of the courier company that you currently work for, and END or QUIT your position. You will then be able to REQUEST at a different company. ** NOTE ** When you change courier companies using this method, you will lose all rating points gained through previous employment.
If you are unabl
14:54 e to complete a courier assignment then type QUIT or ABANDON in the courier cargo assignment room. You will lose rating points equal to two deliveries of the same kind, but you will be able to select a new cargo, which will hopefully be bound for a place that you can reach.
A few commands you'll want to know: @couriers, @courier-rank, @courier-speed
Also worth noting is that, if you destroy the courier starships of rival companies, your company will reward you with a decent amount of courier rating points. However, be aware that destroying ships from your own company will get you nothing but trouble and heartache.
If you yourself lose a courier ship, you will be required to pay for the cost of the ship that you lost. This will put you in some debt that can be paid off at your nearest ATM. When you request a new courier ship from your company, you will also be required to pay THAT cost, as the company will not subsidize the cost of a new ship without a promotion. It's also worth noting that courier ship destructions will count against you should you attempt to transfer to a new company.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer.

15:05 ["Jellyfish" Control Room] (indoors)
You can go down and out.

15:05 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:05 There are no damaged components.

15:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Jellyfish, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:05 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:06 #$#soundpack_pong

15:06 #$#soundpack_lag 92

15:06 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

15:06 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:06 There are no ships here.

15:06 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:06 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

15:06 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

15:06 The starship is already moving.

15:06 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

15:06 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:06 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:06 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:06 You will no longer be able to use non-numeric manual navigation commands.

15:06 You will now be able to use non-numeric manual navigation commands. Please see HELP ALTERNATIVE MANUAL NAVIGATION for information about potential pitfalls.

15:06 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:06 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:07 #$#soundpack_pong

15:07 #$#soundpack_lag 107

15:07 The ship needs to be in space to move.

15:07 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

15:07 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

15:07 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:54 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

15:54 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:54 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:54 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:54 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:54 The ship needs to be in space to move.

15:54 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

15:54 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.
As the lift comes to a halt, the lights vanish and you step off.

16:05 You can't go that way.

16:05 ["Jellyfish" Control Room] (indoors)
You can go down and out.

16:05 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:05 I don't understand that.

16:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Jellyfish, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:05 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

16:05 You input some commands into a console and access the starship's service record.
Initial Launch Date                               11/26/2360

16:05 The starship is already moving.

16:05 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:05 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

16:05 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:05 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:05 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:05 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:06 #$#soundpack_lag 108

16:06 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:06 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:06 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:06 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:06 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:06 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:06 The ship needs to be in space to move.

16:06 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

16:06 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:50 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:50 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:50 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:50 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:50 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:50 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:50 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:50 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:50 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights continue to flash overhead.

16:50 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:50 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

17:46 ["Demonic Rage" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You can go northwest.

17:46 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

17:48 You peer out and see...

17:48 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the four-person surveyor "Ools Storage" and the one-person fighter "Sola Fide" powered down here.
You see the five-person transverser "Ragnarok" and the five-person transverser "Astraeus' Odyssey" landed here.
You see Gee the droid, Larry the droid, Yelp the droid, Cyrax the droid, Cylinder the droid, Torri the droid, Ketemmex the droid, Ramzi the droid, Angela the droid, Gamma the droid, Nia the droid, Jade the droid, and Shade the droid here.
You see Adara Blake, James Johnson, and Leon Thomas here.

17:49 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

17:49 You say, "it's ok"

17:49 Adara Blake smiles softly

17:49 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:49 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:49 Adara Blake strides northwest.

17:49 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:49 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

17:49 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

17:50 #$#soundpack_pong

17:50 #$#soundpack_lag 105

17:50 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

17:50 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

17:50 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:50 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

17:50 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

17:50 You'll have better results scanning in space.

17:50 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

17:50 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:42 ["Demonic Rage" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see Cria Blur here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

18:42 ["Demonic Rage" Weapons Room 2] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go southwest.

18:42 Cria Blur's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "adara, you need coords to be faster?"

18:42 ["Demonic Rage" Weapons Room 1]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

You can go southeast.

18:42 You peer north and see...

18:42 ["Demonic Rage" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see Cria Blur here.
You can go south and out.
Cria Blur's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "because definitly 19 hits is not good for a mod"

18:42 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

18:42 Adara Blake's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Maybe, but it might get confusing"

18:43 #$#soundpack_pong

18:43 #$#soundpack_lag 107

18:43 Cria Blur's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "i'm expecting 25 hits or more"

18:43 Leon Thomas's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I usually say at least 20"

18:43 Cria Blur's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ok we'll see"

18:43 Adara Blake's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "alright"

18:43 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "You mean, my one hit isn't enough?"

18:43 Cria Blur's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "20 is low for a modd"

18:43 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

18:43 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

18:43 #$#soundpack social | laugh | male

18:43 Leon Thomas laughs over the intercom.

18:43 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

18:43 Tom Fritz's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "if you wish later i would be up to practicing in a sim if you want"

18:43 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

18:43 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

18:43 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:43 Adara Blake's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Yeah. I could use it."

18:43 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:43 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Swift Annihilation", the ten-person battlecruiser "Scheherazade", and the one-person cargo hauler "Amilliana" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, Mell the droid, and Katie the droid here.

20:34 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

20:34 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

20:35 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:35 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:35 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:35 The computer announces, "A starship and five planets have been detected in the sector."

20:35 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:35 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

20:35 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

20:35 You should stand up first.

20:35 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

A tall hexagonal terminal dominates the center of this busy starship store. On each of its six faces, various models of starships move about through a starry backdrop of space. A sign above the terminal directs customers to tap the starship of their choice to make a purchase. Tucked into a corner at the front of the store, a middle age woman sits behind a tall counter with a stack of papers arranged neatly before her. Lining the walls and situated on tables throughout the store are working models of the various exploration class starships.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

21:26 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:26 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:27 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:27 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:27 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:27 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

21:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:34 Jenaia the droid

21:34 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a shiny gold metal star keychain.
She is carrying nothing.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site.

Moments later, a flurry of frozen water crystals begins to drift down from vents in the ceiling, lazily swirling through currents of air being pumped out until it settles on the deck plating, where it immediately melts into a hazardous water puddle.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

21:39 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

21:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

21:39 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship and five planets have been detected in the sector."

21:39 The ship is already moving.

21:39 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:39 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:39 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:39 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:39 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

21:39 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:39 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 11, 6, 5."

21:39 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:39 [General Communication] Bob Smith transmits, "One spot folks."

21:39 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:40 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:40 You hear a mechanical whine as the ship's solar panels orient themselves toward a star.

21:40 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:40 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

21:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

21:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:40 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

21:40 You stand up.

21:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:36 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:36 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:36 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:36 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:36 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

22:36 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

22:36 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

22:37 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

22:37 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

22:37 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:37 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:37 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:37 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:37 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

22:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

Tradesman Certificates
--------------------------------------------------
Tradesman item certificates are a method for a donator to redeem a request to use at a later date. Such requests are placed into a secondary queue, and do not take priority over items requested on Empanda Station. They can also be gifted to other players if you're feeling generous enough! It doesn't matter if the recipient of the gift is a donator or not. It may also be worth noting that the exchange and use of tradesman certificates is out of character, thus you can use and obtain them anywhere in the game except for locations that reside out of communications range (but can't talk about them via IC communication).
Furthermore, tradesman certificates may only be submitted once every two weeks. If you submit a tradesman item certificate and it is completed a day later, you may not submit another one for up to two weeks after that time. Rejections do not incur a waiting period.
 
Commands:
  @CGIVE <person>
Give <person> a tradesman certificate. Once you have selected a player to gift, you will be prompted for the amount of tradesman certificates you wish to transfer. You can't give more than you have in your account. Typing the command without arguments will prompt you for a player's name. Once complete, you'll see something like:
        You give 1 tradesman certificate to Mitchell Morganivich Mihola.
The recipient will see:
        Mitchell
23:02  Morganivich Mihola has just given you 1 tradesman certificate.
 
  @CREQUEST
Request an item using one of your available certificates. You will be presented with a menu, similar to the one that appears in the Empanda Station tradesman concourse. You must have at least one tradesman certificate to utilize this command. For sake of immersion, this command cannot be utilized while out of communications range. Complete all tradesman requests prior to leaving local space.
 
  @REQUEST-CERT
Redeem a certificate. You will be prompted to confirm the request, and once complete, a tradesman item certificate will be added to your account.
 
  @CERT-MARKET
Enter the tradesman item certificate marketplace. You can sell or buy tradesman certificates here for credits. The command may be shortened down to @CM for brevity. Be warned that trades are not audited by the Toastsoft hosts. Confirm at your own risk!
You may also type @CM [on | off] to connect or disconnect from the tradesman market channel. Notifications of new and completed sales are announced here.
 
  REQUESTCHECK
See if you're eligible to request a donator item. Note: similarly to the commands above, this command is out of character.
 
Notes:
* Tradesman certificates are attached to your account, not your character. This means they stay with you through rerolls.
* If your request is rejected, you will receive a tradesman certificate redemption token in the mai

The warm air is humid and heavy, and scented with the salty tang of an ocean whose waters are just visible far in the distance to the north. A wide set of stairs leads down off the landing platform to the golden sand of the beach, while smaller stairs lead off towards tree-lined residential streets. A set of stairs off to the side has been painted bright blue, and these appear to lead up to the ITPN station and down to an underground garage.
You see the one-person expediter "Emarld Phoenix" powered down here.
You see the three-person supercarrier "Rise To Fame" landed here.
You see OK the droid, Medc the droid, Squeal the droid, Billy the droid, and Gash the droid here.
You can go north, east, southeast, up, and down.
