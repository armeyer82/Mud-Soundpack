Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport

You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made

periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small seashell pink trash can, a glossy dark
violet ceramic felo chow bowl, a turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and
a glass-covered top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a

Subject: Battle of Mir beacon
Author: Akemi Bando
Posted: 12:57 20 May 2316 GST

I set up a marker beacon west of the Battle of Mir. It has a 3 light-year range,
which is more than sufficient for something that is intended to be used for
autotraveling back to the beaconed sector. It is called Home Beacon Mu 534. It
will be up for a month and 5 days.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small seashell pink trash can, a glossy dark
violet ceramic felo chow bowl, a turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and
a glass-covered top, and a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug
here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a

periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small seashell pink trash can, a glossy dark
violet ceramic felo chow bowl, a turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and
a glass-covered top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and

Though simply constructed and without the usual amenities, this enormous dock
provides space for dozens of ships. Starships periodically enter the dock,
thrusters burning against the sudden change to artificial gravity. A few of the
surfaces are a cold metallic gray, dirty with years of exhaust, though most have
been recently replaced and gleam under the bright recessed lighting in the
walls. Wide corridors lead into the station to the northwest and northeast. A
wide ramp leads down below the station to the asteroid mining facility.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She is wearing a short-sleeved periwinkle blue sailor top with a white tie, a
pair of body-skimming white lowrise capri jeans with periwinkle blue and coral
pink jeweled flowers on the front and back pockets, and a pair of strappy white
leather sandals.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a large
expandable telescoping xenology container.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both
hands, waist, and both ankles are left uncovered.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad.

and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in

#help action
Command: #action {search string} {commands} {priority}

         Have tintin search for a certain string of text from the mud, if the
         string is found it will execute the commands.  Variables %1 to %99
         are substituted from the input string, and can be used in the command.

         If the search string starts with ~, color codes must be matched, which
         you can see by enabling: #config {convert meta} on.

         The following Perl compatible regular expression options are available:

       ^ force match of start of line.
       $ force match of end of line.
  %1-%99 lazy match of any text, available at %1-%99.
      %0 should be avoided in triggers, and if left alone lists all matches.
     { } embed a raw regular expression, available at %1-%99 + 1.
         [ ] . + | ( ) ? * are treated as normal text unlessed used within
         braces. Keep in mind that { } is replaced with ( ) automatically.

         Of the following the (lazy) match is available at %1-%99 + 1

      %w match zero to any number of letters.
      %W match zero to any number of non letters.
      %d match zero to any number of digits.
      %D match zero to any number of non digits.
      %s match zero to any number of spaces.
      %S match zero to any number of non spaces.

      %? match zero or one character.
      %. match one character.
      %+ match one to any number of characters.
      %* match zero to any number of characters.

      %i matching becomes case insensitive.
      %I matching becomes case sensitive (default).

         Actions can be triggered by the showme command.

Example: #act {^You are hungry$} {get bread backpack;eat bread}
         Performs 2 commands as you get the hunger message, tintin will not
         be fooled by someone saying 'You are hungry'.

Example: #act {%1 tells you 'hello'} {tell %1 Hello %1. How are you today?}
         This allows you to seem like a nice, attentive, fast typing gentleman.

Example: #act {A puppy barks at you, wagging {his|her|its} tail.} {pat puppy}
         This allows you to be nice to puppies regardless of their sex.

Comment: You can remove an action with the #unaction command.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad.
