Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair with Prissy the
sleeping big violet long-haired felo on it, a mahogany coffee table, a large
bubbling aquarium containing green and yellow aquatic life and round rocks, a
glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black upholstered sofa, a very large and
extraordinarily soft black shamak fur, a small blueberry trash bin, a small red
ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an insulated green cooler, a
compact white refrigerator, a red plastic food storage container, a small blue
ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Kiwi the little calico
CatBot, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated blue cooler, and Ciera
the humanoid service robot here.

         highest precedence, so inside the () is always evaluated first.
         Strings must be enclosed in " " and use regex with == and !=,
         in the case of <= and >= the alphabetic order is compared.

Example: #math {heals} {$mana / 40}
         Assuming there is a variable $mana, divides its value by 40 and stores
         the result in $heals.

Example: #action {^You receive %0 experience} {updatexp %0}
         #alias updatexp {#math {xpneed} {$xpneed - %0}
         Let's say you have a variable which stores xp needed for your next
         level.  The above will modify that variable after every kill, showing
         the amount still needed.

Example: #action {%0 tells %1}
           {#if {"%0" == "Bubba" && $afk} {reply I'm away, my friend.}}

#help function
Command: #function {name} {operation}

         Functions allow you to execute a script within a line of text, and
         replace the function call with the line of text generated by the
         function.

         Be aware that each function should set the $result variable.

         To use a function use the @ character before the function name.
         The function arguments should be placed between braces behind the
         function name.

         The function itself can use the provided arguments which are stored
         in %1 to %9, with %0 holding all arguments.

         Currently you can't use a function from within another function

Example: #function {rnd} {#math {result} {1 d (%2 - %1 + 1) + %1 - 1}}
         #showme A random number between 100 and 200: @rnd{100 200}

Example: #function gettime {#format result %t %H:%M}
         #showme The current time is @gettime{}

Comment: You can remove a function with the #unfunction command.

#format time {%t %H-%M-%S}
#help format
Command: #format {variable} {format} {argument1} {argument2} {etc}

         Allows you to store a string into a variable in the exact same way
         C's sprintf works with a few enhancements and limitations such as
         no integer operations and a maximum of 20 arguments. If you use format
         inside an alias or action you must escape the %0-9 like: %+4s.

Example: #format {test} {%+9s} {string}  pad string with up to 9 spaces
         #format {test} {%-9s} {string}  post pad string with up to 9 spaces
         #format {test} {%.8s} {string}  copy at most 8 characters
         #format {test} {%a}   {number}  print corresponding ascii character
         #format {test} {%c}   {string}  use a highlight color name
         #format {test} {%d}   {number}  print a number with integer formatting
         #format {test} {%g}   {number}  perform thousand grouping on {number}
         #format {test} {%h}   {string}  turn text into a header line
         #format {test} {%l}   {string}  lowercase text
         #format {test} {%m}   {string}  perform mathematical calculation
         #format {test} {%n}     {name}  capitalize the first letter
         #format {test} {%p}   {string}  strip leading and trailing spaces
         #format {test} {%r}   {string}  reverse text, hiya = ayih
         #format {test} {%s}   {string}  print given string
         #format {test} {%t}   {format}  display time with strftime format
         #format {test} {%u}   {string}  uppercase text
         #format {test} {%w}   {string}  wordwrap text
         #format {cols} {%C}         {}  store the screen width in {cols}
         #format {test} {%L}   {string}  store the string length in {test}

You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They
seem somewhat loud. The signal strength meter reads: 68%.
Johann Rowan activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive
detections and recent ping returns.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "You did say the station was at 68, so
good to know we're close."

#help sub
Command: #substitute {text} {new text}

         Allows you to replace original text from the mud with different text.
         This is helpful for complex coloring and making things more readable.
         The %1-%99 variables can be used to capture text and use it as part of
         the new output, and the ^ char is valid to only check the beginning of
         the line for the text specified.

         If only one argument is given, all active substitutions that match the
         strings are displayed.  The '%*' char is valid in this instance.  See
         '#help regex', for advanced wildcard information.

         If no argument is given, all subs are displayed.

Example: #sub {Zoe} {ZOE}
         Any instance of Zoe will be replaced with ZOE.

Example: #sub {~\e[0;34m} {\e[1;34m}
         Replace generic dark blue color codes with bright blue ones.

Example: #sub {%1massacres%2} {<018>%1<118>MASSACRES<018>%2}
         Replaces all occurrences of 'massacres' with 'MASSACRES' in red.

Comment: See '#help action', for more information about triggers.

Comment: See '#help colors', for more information.

Comment: You can remove a substitution with the #unsubstitute command.

[Tom Town; Docking Bay]
Glaring spotlights in the upper corners of this docking bay illuminate every
centimeter of the large rectangular space, casting long pale shadows around the
battered starships docked here and the traders, workers, and technicians milling
around them. The bay seems to be merely a large metal box built around a
framework of massive steel girders left exposed except where hydraulic,
electrical, and ventilation systems encased in heavy metal ducts are attached to
the walls. Large cables extend across the solid metal floor from massive
batteries along the south wall of the bay, snaking toward individual starships.
To the north is the massive airlock for docking and departing ships, and to the
south is the single airlock for those venturing into the station. The air is
cool here, and the gravity is approximately two-thirds of Earth standard.

[Tom Town; Docking Bay]
Glaring spotlights in the upper corners of this docking bay illuminate every
centimeter of the large rectangular space, casting long pale shadows around the
battered starships docked here and the traders, workers, and technicians milling
around them. The bay seems to be merely a large metal box built around a
framework of massive steel girders left exposed except where hydraulic,
electrical, and ventilation systems encased in heavy metal ducts are attached to
the walls. Large cables extend across the solid metal floor from massive
batteries along the south wall of the bay, snaking toward individual starships.
To the north is the massive airlock for docking and departing ships, and to the
south is the single airlock for those venturing into the station. The air is
cool here, and the gravity is approximately two-thirds of Earth standard.
The galleon "Queen Brynn II" and the one-person interplanetary shuttle

[Tom Town; Docking Bay]
Glaring spotlights in the upper corners of this docking bay illuminate every
centimeter of the large rectangular space, casting long pale shadows around the
battered starships docked here and the traders, workers, and technicians milling
around them. The bay seems to be merely a large metal box built around a
framework of massive steel girders left exposed except where hydraulic,
electrical, and ventilation systems encased in heavy metal ducts are attached to
the walls. Large cables extend across the solid metal floor from massive
batteries along the south wall of the bay, snaking toward individual starships.
To the north is the massive airlock for docking and departing ships, and to the
south is the single airlock for those venturing into the station. The air is
cool here, and the gravity is approximately two-thirds of Earth standard.
The galleon "Queen Brynn II" and the one-person interplanetary shuttle
"Trademaker" are landed here.
You see a large metal recycling bin, about a dozen battered-looking docked
starships, a man wearing a precarious stack of hats, a smirking young man, and a
blonde woman in a red shipsuit here.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar
and cuffs and a pair of soft light blue boots. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a light purple flightbag with
a pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head,
face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a cool glass of bubbly golden tea in her right hand, and a bowl
of forty-seven plastic fruit in her left hand.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.
Civilian Liaisons
You cannot determine the current office holders while out of communications
range.
In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.
Civilian Liaisons
You cannot determine the current office holders while out of communications
range.
In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.
The current civilian term started on 31 October 2316 GST. Time remaining: 27
days, 20 hours, 46 minutes, and 50 seconds

the right decision in time. I wish I would have said to Melinda that I would
consider the request rather than just outright refusing. I'm still not
comfortable with someone from League asking that I go back because no offense
they're not from my own alliance so who are they to order me around?"

At 15:42 GST on 14 November, 2316 the flow is from up and slightly south
southwest at a speed of 4940 mincycles per seccycle.
Upon reflection, Lily wants to head home. I can't blame her, guild trips suck.
We're heading back to Tom Town and going home in a straight line.
I did the math, and I'll show my work here somewhat as a record, but my
calculations say we should go at a heading of 90 -14. This is how I arived at
that number.
For all intents and purposes, assume Andy's is directly south from Campeche.
Tom Town is more or less directly up from Andy's about 77.4 lightyears.
So, we have two legs of 300 and 77.4 with a 90 degree angle. Using the
pythagorean Theorum, I postulate the h line is 309.8 lightyears long.
So, the sine of the angle at Campeche is 77.4 divided by 309.8 That equals,
0.2498.
Now, using the inverse sine or arcsine, I figured out the angle, and that is
14.46796. I hope I'm right.

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

Torus Underground Resistance Upgrades:
Outsider Scan Signature Database: 1500000.00 (Secret Underground Resistance
Supplies)
Requirements: none
This upgrade allows you to scan an Outsider ship and get accurate information
about its armaments and damage.
Outsider Battle Thrall Scan Signature Database: 250000.00 (Secret Underground
Resistance Supplies)
Requirements: none
This upgrade allows you to scan a Battle Thrall ship and get accurate
information about its armaments and damage.
Targeting Computer 25000000.00 (Secret Underground Resistance Supplies)
Requirements: 500 combat points
This upgrade allows your laser or chaingun turrets to immediately abort firing
if there is no target in the area you specified or the target has moved.
Improved Anchor Package 25000000.00 (Secret Underground Resistance Supplies)
Requirements: 250 industry points
The improved anchor package allows an asteroid hauler to do less damage to an
asteroid when it anchors itself and begins hauling it back to a collecter
station. This in turn makes the asteroid more valuable and as a result, the
pilot gets paid more. Note: this upgrade cannot be installed on an Asteroid
Courier.

Other Upgrades:
Decoy Beacon Launcher 5,000,000.00 (AFW Command equipment requisition)
Requirements: none
The decoy beacon launcher is a device that people generally tend to install on
many of their well-armed ships. These launchers after being loaded with the
necessary decoy beacons bought from the same spot as the launchers themselves
have the ability to launch different-level signal strength beacons which will
attract outsider or IFS patrols. This is generally done to prevent them from
actually stumbling their ways into alliance sectors and causing trouble.
Obviously, the stronger the signal, the stronger the enemy response is likely to
be. For example, you will get more ships responding to your high-strength signal
beacon than you will to your standard-strength signal beacons. Note: do not
launch decoy beacons in Mutuality space. Read the pilot's guide to preparation
for more information regarding the reasons why.
Airlock chime 10,000.00 (Sold at any Supply Store)
Requirements: none
This chime will alert you whenever your ship's hatch is opened. So, presumably,
whenever someone enters your ship. Obviously, you have to be inside to hear the
chime. Like most upgrades, it will need to be bolted down in the control room of
your ship.
Gunnery Report Unit 500000.00 (sold at any supply store)
Requirements: none
The gunnery report unit allows the ship to track the number of hits made by each
weapons room against an enemy ship and to display those results to all in the
ship when the enemy ship has been destroyed. You must bolt the gunnery report
unit into the control room of your starship. If it disappears, don't be alarmed,
it has just integrated itself into the ship systems. Do not install a second
one.
Flightlockers 25,000,000.00 (torus Infamous Andy's Ham, Hot Dogs, And Ready Room
Supplies)
Requirements: none
These flightlockers are lockers that you would bolt into the airlock of your
starship, allowing yourself and any pilots that go anywhere with you to store
those bulky flightbags rather than always wearing them on your person. Both
storing and retrieving your flightbags is a delightfully quick process!
Outsider Battle Thrall Translation Interface 1000000.00 (AFW Command Aftermarket
Hardware)
Requirements: none
The translation interface allows a ship to decode any transmitions sent by
Battle Thrall (or Children of the Sun) ships into pictures, which is their main
mode of communication. It also allows a ship to respond in kind using the usual
methods of general sector communication.
Anomaly Detector 5,000,000.00 (Space Vermin Patrol Command Anti-Vermin
Equipment)
Requirements: 5 exploration points
Though I have not yet had an opportunity to test this, I have been told that it
detects and stops for anomalous objects more commonly labeled "other objects" on
one's starmap and/or rundown display.
Viral Injection Pylon Launcher 5,000,000.00 (The torus underground resistance
Viral Injection Pylons)
Requirements: 50 space combat points
The viral injection pylon launchers are mainly used in times of warfare. During
the initial outsider ocupation, we used these launchers to get our sector flight
control towers back under the control of our alliances. It is also likely
possible to use the viral pylons to take sector control from an enemy alliance
during times of warfare as well, though this has not yet been tested. Obviously,
you will need to buy and load viral pylons to launch when you utilize your
launcher. Otherwise it will just sit there and look as pretty as a decoration.
Revo Developmental Technologies Applied Bolt Cannon 132000000.00 (Endymion Revo)
Requirements: 1500 combat points
The bolt cannon is capable of launching two different types of projectiles. The
disarming bolt is aimed specifically at the weapon systems of an enemy ship, and
has the potential to destroy a light turret or heavy launcher with a single
shot, as well as minimizing weapon effectiveness for a time. The disabling bolt
is aimed specifically at the drive section of a ship, causing damage to the FTL
drive or destroying it altogether, as well as potentially causing the enemy ship
to be unable to FTL out of a sector for a time. Note: your ship must not be
moving when you attempt to utilize the bolt cannon.
Rescue Pod Handshaking Protocol 280000000.00 (Tandem Station S & S Ships
Upgrades)
Requirements: 2000 Space Combat Points.
Ever found yourself on a fighter launched from something like, an expeditionary
starship? Ever been worried while on that fighter that you might explode and go
on a pod ride all the way home all by yourself? Well, if your expedition vessel
has this upgrade, you will no longer have to worry about this, because if you
explode violently, your escape pod will tag the vessel it launched from as its
homing beacon, and deposit your pod neatly inside of its docking bay!
Docking Bay Expansion 10 golden tael (Famous Andy's Trading Post Space-Makers)
Requirements: 3000 industry points.
this upgrade gives you an approximate 20% increase to your ship's docking bay.
However, be careful when installing it, because it will also increase the number
of units your own ship will take up in a docking bay accordingly. Note: ask
other pilots about the location of Famous Andy's Trading Post, as it is not
reachable via the normal FTL beacon networks. You may also have to ask pilots
for further information about golden Taels.
Many specialized Glyphmaker upgrades as well as other starship upgrades via the
starship utilities license available can give your ship some useful
enhancements. Some of these include artifact detectors and storage compressors,
while others might include wormhole drive tracers and methods for faster airlock
cycling time. These upgrades can only be gotten from other pilots. Ask around
for further information. Note: When you bolt those, they will also not be shown
in the control room with the wormhole drive tracer as the exception, because
they will be integrated into the ship systems. Do not be alarmed or try to bolt
down more of them. You can check which ones you already have by glancing at the
status readout of your ship.

Johann Rowan removes a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades: 2316 Edition" from a
small black leather backpack.
Johann Rowan begins reading in a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades: 2316

'YEah, but Pierre would love to get his hands on one of our cruisers.
You say, "YEah, but Pierre would love to get his hands on one of our cruisers."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I wonder if they would lose access to
the Pincer too."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh yeah he would."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I do not like the AEU cruisers."
'Well, in that case, they'd lose access to the bastille too.
You say, "Well, in that case, they'd lose access to the bastille too."
Johann Rowan puts a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades: 2316 Edition" in a small
black leather backpack.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Probably any cruiser for that matter but
he sees the power of lasers and engine speed on an aEU cruiser."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Honestly, I feel like for the most part,
the League builds the best all-round ships."
-johann Flying an AEU combat ship is a bit different and takes a bit different
tactics than fighting in a Fringe or League ship.
You say to Johann, "Flying an AEU combat ship is a bit different and takes a bit
different tactics than fighting in a Fringe or League ship."
A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "The Fringe ships are more fragile and
have too many weapons and not enough storage which make them ineffective for
prolonged combat."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "The AEU ships, in my oppinion would be
great if they used either lower-powered lasers, or chainguns."
'The Fringe rely on being able to destroy targets swiftly. More swiftly than AEU
or League.
You say, "The Fringe rely on being able to destroy targets swiftly. More swiftly
than AEU or League."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Hah, well if you listen to Akemi and
Melinda on how the weapons work, it doesn't matter how much weaponry you have."
-johann Nah, I've seen an AEU pulsar pop a heavy in 8 volleys or maybe 9.
You say to Johann, "Nah, I've seen an AEU pulsar pop a heavy in 8 volleys or
maybe 9."
'And pop a ninlil in two volleys.
You say, "And pop a ninlil in two volleys."
Johann says to you in a German accent, "OH, yeah, the weapons are great, but
having more than five lasers in a room is too much of a grid drain."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Even five is pushing it."
'Not if you have smart gunners that use grid wisely.
You say, "Not if you have smart gunners that use grid wisely."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "That's also not assuming your eng is
using tools."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But in a straight up slugging match, I'd
match a league ship as able to outlast the other alliances."
Johann says to you in a German accent, "Hah, the league gunners are a lot like
Fringe gunners. Shoot often, and shoot fast."
'True, but I've seen them shoot too often and miss a lot too.
You say, "True, but I've seen them shoot too often and miss a lot too."
Johann Rowan nods.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "ON really fast attackers, I try to tell
people shoot once, maybe twice, then wait for them to move."
'It's great if you can shot fast, ut if only a few of your shots land weapon
hits, doesn't really matter then.
You say, "It's great if you can shot fast, ut if only a few of your shots land
weapon hits, doesn't really matter then."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, well in the same vein, if you shoot
fast with lasers, eventually you're only shooting one or two, so that's kind of
a waste of turrets."
'Yeah, but I've seen more than one gunner get trigger happy on those escorts and
they can't hit the broadside of a arn.
You say, "Yeah, but I've seen more than one gunner get trigger happy on those
escorts and they can't hit the broadside of a arn."
Johann Rowan nods.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "You have to factor in the pilot's moves,
the escort's moves, and the time it takes to fire."
'precisely.
You say, "Precisely."
'I wath for  those who get top gun on like escorts, ninlis, and marshalls . It's

You say, "I wath for those who get top gun on like escorts, ninlis, and

Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, well one volley and they're gone."
'watch, that is.
You say, "Watch, that is."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I also think people are teaching weapons
wrong."
'That's for certain
You say, "That's for certain."
Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while
snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "The general rule people believe is that
your weapon only hits one component at a time, so any extra damage your shot
does is superfluous."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "So heavy weapons are inferior."
'I think Cesar would disagree with you.
You say, "I think Cesar would disagree with you."
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "Oh?"
A medium-sized semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.
''He always ordered minis.
You say, "'He always ordered minis."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, well so do I."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Unless I have a torpedo bonus."
'Even on the fighters, he'd order minis. IT was minis all the time.
You say, "Even on the fighters, he'd order minis. IT was minis all the time."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "OH."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I have done that if it's taking forever,
but light eapons work on light ships just fine."
nod 
You nod.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But I have run some tests, and I have
seen a torpedo hit more than one thing at once."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I don't believe the energy gets wasted
unless it's a pure hull shot that hits a failsafe."
'YEah, same with minis.
You say, "YEah, same with minis."
Johann Rowan nods.
ext No, we're not accepting guests right now.
You say into the external PA microphone, "No, we're not accepting guests right
now."

Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "There is some validity to the idea though
of using the two-second chains or the three second torpedos."
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
-johann Yeah, I used 3 second lasers against the BEST.
You say to Johann, "Yeah, I used 3 second lasers against the BEST."
'er bEAST
You say, "Er bEAST."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily says to Johann, "On the current model of AEU cruiser, the only 2 rooms
which have 5 lasers are 5 and 6."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Those have no launchers as well."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Personally, I like having storage room in
my ships, and at least one kinetic weapon. In that vein, I generally choose
chainguns and minicannons to maximize everything."
Johann says to Lily in a German accent, "Ahh, well that seems sensible. The
cruisers I saw had six lasers in some rooms."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Five is doable if you keep an eye on the
grid."
nod johann 'YEah, that was probably on the old model.
You nod to Johann Rowan. "YEah, that was probably on the old model."
Johann Rowan nods.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I have to admit, I use my minicannon on
the bastille for everything."
'Heh, so do I.
You say, "Heh, so do I."
chuckle
You chuckle.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Four turrets does the job, but the cannon
does it faster."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not anymore."
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "Hmm?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The others have 4 lasers and one mini."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, that's fine."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Hah, again though, the league cruiser has
the best of all worlds! WE have five lasers in the top rooms, four lasers and
one launcher in the forward rooms, and two lasers and two launchers in the rear
rooms."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I liked the old model better though."
Johann Rowan grins.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Actually I think the old AEU cruiser has
like that last configuration in room 6."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "2 and 2."
'The new AEU cruiser has more turrets.
You say, "The new AEU cruiser has more turrets."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But the Fringe has that ship with sixteen
chainguns in one room, and the League has that stupid little fighter with three
launchers."
Johann Rowan nods.
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "More isn't always better though, it's how
many of them are firing. I mean, how often do you double torp?"
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Having a spread is better which is why I
liked the old league cruiser since every room had one launcher except wr 4 which
had nothing but turrets."
A long black soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a
small plastic statue of Benjamin Masterson.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Interesting."
'I hate when people double torp. I can't keep up the grid at all. Even with
expert tools.
You say, "I hate when people double torp. I can't keep up the grid at all. Even
with expert tools."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "It's not meant to be something you use
constantly."
'Yeah, well tell Akemi that.
You say, "Yeah, well tell Akemi that."
'And Morris.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I use it either as an initial volley, or
if a ship is hovering around a hull threshhold and it just won't get past it."
You say, "And Morris."
'and they don't listen to my screams of protest to watch their double volleys.
You say, "And they don't listen to my screams of protest to watch their double
volleys."
Johann Rowan nods.
A medium-length yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
swims around a small plastic statue of Benjamin Masterson.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I wish you could put different launchers
in different rooms to maximize your efficiency."
'I refuse to engineer if Akemi is going to be in rooms 5 or six on a League
ship.
You say, "I refuse to engineer if Akemi is going to be in rooms 5 or six on a
League ship."
Johann Rowan grins at Lily Kaise.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, as a pilot, I tell people when I
want them to use a double volley."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But like I said, spreading out your
launchers between rooms makes it more effective because they're all firing."
'heh, good luck telling Aekmi what to do.
You say, "Heh, good luck telling Aekmi what to do."
Johann Rowan nods.
A medium-sized semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked
Buran-class rift galleon.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Seriously."
Lily Kaise laughs.
'or Morris
You say, "Or Morris."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Well, if they have no grid and can't
fire, that's their problem if they don't listen."
'true enough.
You say, "True enough."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I'm working on Morris, but they have him
pretty good."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch
on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well as an engineer, you have probably
heard me say to watch your doubles and if you don't and run out of grid, I can't
help you there."
Johann Rowan nods.
nod 'for sure.
You nod. "For sure."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Sounds mean but they aren't helping the
crew by doing that."
'It's true.
You say, "It's true."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "To be fair, Akemi, Melinda, and Morris
have been pretty effective doing what they're doing so far. I'd love to see them
try it my way."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Ali agrees with me on gunning philosophy
though."
'Try what your way?
You ask, "Try what your way?"
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Gunning."
'Hmmm, I've beaten all three of them gunning on a number of occasions.
You say, "Hmmm, I've beaten all three of them gunning on a number of occasions."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "The thing I find with him is he likes to
circle the ship off the three axis."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Z that is."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Agreed, you do very well."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But they do get the job done."
'true, Morris does fly how Melinda and Lillian teach.
You say, "True, Morris does fly how Melinda and Lillian teach."
'They gun well until it's an escort or something.
You say, "They gun well until it's an escort or something."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I gave Morris a lesson and at least gave
him an alternative way to think about it."
'Yeah, as did I.
You say, "Yeah, as did I."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I am still a bit rusty flying, but my
philosophy is good, execution isn't where I want it yet."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But that's just retraining my instincts."
nod johann 'Same here.
You nod to Johann Rowan. "Same here."
'I can always improve.
You say, "I can always improve."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, Ali though he will circle the ship
generally above or below it, so when it moves out of range, he's more likely to
lose track."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Since being at an angle like that is
slightly longer than one coordinate."

you should be comfortable on the z, but if you can, stay on the cardinals, do
it."

You nod.

You say, "Exactly."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Also, someone I saw, and I don't remember
who, looked like they just tracked the first ship on the list rather than take
out the thralls first."
'Oh, I think Blake used to do that.
You say, "Oh, I think Blake used to do that."
'I don't think he does anymore.
You say, "I don't think he does anymore."
Johann Rowan nods.

A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Hahaha, yeah, I know."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well one day Akemi was bragging that she
did that in a solo beacon but Shule and I joked that yeah try that a few times
in a gunship or higher."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, well you only get one chain on solo
beacons."
nod johann
You nod to Johann Rowan.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "If the thralls ever got smart, they'd
chain you and sit at the end of the chains in different directions."
'I've heard that's what they do on a very high cruiser beacon.
You say, "I've heard that's what they do on a very high cruiser beacon."
'And they make it so you virtually can't move.
You say, "And they make it so you virtually can't move."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Haha, well yeah, at that point, I might
try sitting on an edge so they can't do that."

Johann Rowan exclaims in a German accent, "OH that's another thing that annoys

help bounty hunting
--
Star Conquest Help: Bounty Hunting
--
Category: Activities
--
There are two types of bounty hunting.  The first is accomplished simply by
destroying enemy ships, which will gain you a profit depending on the relations
of your alliance and the other ship's, as well as the type of ship destroyed. 
In wartime, the bounty from destroying enemy ships is often enough to fund your
personal war effort, with the possibility of a bit of profit on the side.
The second type of bounty hunting involves capturing people wanted for certain
offenses.  As of this writing, the two main offenses that you're likely to
capture someone for is transporting contraband and illegal starship
modification.  If you see a ship containing contraband or if you suspect that it
is illegally modified, you can TAG it for a bounty hunt.  You then have 24 hours
to capture the ship's owner and turn him or her into a security office in the
same area of space where the offense was committed, which can be found on any
capital planet.  Simply stun the pilot, go to a security office, and ARREST him
or her to collect your bounty.  Starships that are carrying illegal goods or are
illegally modified are not protected by local navies or militia as long as the
good or modification is illegal within their jurisdiction.
List of Commands
* TAG: Scan a ship for illegal items and produces a bounty hunt tag. Only works
in Gamma or more secure space.
* ARREST: At a security office, arrest a subdued offender and collect your
reward.

Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches out.
A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.
A medium-sized semi-transparent cylindrical creature with long dangling tendrils
and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.
A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and
a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
02:00:00
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while
snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with yellow skin and blue split wings
stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch
on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
Johann Rowan cheers.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
A long black soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked Buran-class rift galleon and wraps its
tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
A medium-length yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the
glass, then it withdraws.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches south.
A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and
a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
-aquarium Hi tentacle dude. You can't come out here though.
You say to a large bubbling aquarium containing green and yellow aquatic life
and round rocks, "Hi tentacle dude. You can't come out here though."
Johann Rowan grins.
Johann Rowan stands up from a black leather captain's chair.
Johann Rowan walks south.
Johann Rowan walks in from the south.
Johann Rowan sits down on a black leather captain's chair.
l johann
Johann Rowan
He appears to be 35 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has
fair skin. His body is fairly muscular with muscled hips and strong calves. He
has broad shoulders and a muscular chest. His face is oval and handsome, with a
straight nose and strong chin. His lips are full and reddish pink and
occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of arched
eyebrows, his eyes are blue and average-shaped. His chin-length, straight hair
is blonde and neatly combed.
 He is wearing a black flight jacket with a League shoulder patch, a pair of tan
gunnery gloves, a slim black leather belt, a pair of khaki cargo shorts, a pair
of black dress socks, and a pair of supple black flight boots. He is also
wearing a small black leather backpack, a plain touch einrophone in a black
leather phone holster, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, and a gleaming platinum
eternity band inset with five rows of sparkling round diamonds. His head, face,
both eyes, neck, both knees, and both calves are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

cuffs and a pair of tan suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white
blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten
on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a
Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes,
both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cafe Pepe Sangria in her
right hand.

one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black upholstered
sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft black shamak fur, a small blueberry
trash bin, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an
insulated green cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a red plastic food storage
container, a small blue ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Kiwi
the little calico CatBot, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated blue
cooler, Ciera the humanoid service robot, an insulated purple cooler, and Buddy
the hefty blue soldier felo here.
Johann Rowan is sitting on a black leather captain's chair. Lily Kaise is

A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch

A medium-length black soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears
up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked Buran-class rift galleon and wraps its

Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo suddenly jumps onto a black leather captain's
chair.

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Pilot Corps
--
Category: Background
--
A civilian pilot corps is a group of non-military licensed pilots sponsored by
an alliance. Each alliance maintains a pilot corps, with the exception of the
Mutuality, where citizen pilots of one form or another are the majority.
CIVILIAN PILOTS
A civilian who wishes to join a pilot corps must enroll in a flight school and
pass its course, which typically takes about two years. Flight school involves
lectures and written tests, followed by flight time with a trained instructor,
seeking to achieve a requirement of flight hours. A final written exam and
flight test is required before a pilot can fly without an instructor. Upon
passing their final tests, the new pilot is granted their license. Upon joining
the civilian corps, the pilot must also sign a binding contract. Most pilots
initially fly in the civilian program under a probationary period, during which
they're referred to as cadets. If they serve well during this period, the cadets
will be considered full pilots and can serve in the civilian program
indefinitely.
PILOT CORPS CONTRACT
Pilot corps vary slightly from alliance to alliance, but many of the terms are
similar:
* The pilot agrees to a hefty tax rate when paid for the resources he or she
brings to a spaceport, often as much as 95%. Even so, pilots quickly become
extremely wealthy.
* In return, the alliance will subsidize all starship purchases, covering around
75% of the cost of a ship. Thus, alliances own a majority of a pilot's ship, and
this is why pilots are always ultimately obligated to their alliance. This
differs in the Mutuality, where parts and wealth are both harder to come by, and
station owners will often only be able to cover around 50% of a ship's value.
Mutuality members tend to pay more for the same ship class than a pilot of any
other alliance. (Note: higher performance starship components are subsidized to
a lesser degree or not at all, and therefore it is not uncommon for the value of
upgraded components to quickly outstrip the base cost of the starship, from the
pilot's perspective.)
* In times of war or other risks to the alliance, civilian pilots are expected
to make a reasonable effort to give aid to their alliance. This can include not
only combat, but also volunteering for a wide variety of special, sometimes
risky missions, since the alliance's own navy is in fact often less experienced
in such matters, having been trained mainly for home sector defense. Refusing to
fight or enter any sort of combat at all, such as claiming to be a pacifist,
would make your agreement invalid and revoke your licence. With escape pods
granting 100% success and aliens that want to exterminate the species, civilian
pilots don't have the luxury of reasons not to fight.
* Civilian pilot travel is restricted to a handful of cities, for the stated
reason of protecting local economies.
* Alliances will restrict the use of certain equipment and starship models until
they judge the pilot to be sufficiently experienced. They make this
determination with the license point system.
CONDITIONS OF A CONTINUING CONTRACT
In order to remain a member of their pilot corps, a pilot must remain in
agreement with the above terms, particularly remaining loyal to the alliance and
standing in its defense. A pilot must also maintain adequate mental health. A
pilot who persists in running counter to their alliance's interests will first
be warned, then will eventually be punished with "rogue" status, and in extreme
cases, may be blacklisted and ejected from the alliance. In this case, an
ejected pilot can only hope that another alliance is willing to offer him or her
a safe haven.
