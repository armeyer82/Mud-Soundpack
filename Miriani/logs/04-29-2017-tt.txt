[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, tell them what
I said. If you want, I could write it down and all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "In the past, we've
always had three people on the gemini; one without a battlesuit to fly it, while
the two with battlesuits went in and did their damage."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Come to think of it,
I could be stupid, but I think during one of your combat classes you even
mentioned it briefly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It is partially my
fault. I use to hold periodic classes on how to handle these things. However,
with the corps having been so small lately, I slacked off, because I figured
that everyone already knew these things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I did, I did!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, practice is
better than lessons in a class, but I am glad I remembered something better than
I thought I had."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You are grand
retainer of knowledge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And unfortunately, we
don't have a hardened thrall ship to practice on!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yep, would be nice if
people over at the accord could simulate such a thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can always send a
message to the liaison office asking them to add that simulation to the Accord
simulators. Including the org one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, asking them to
forward your request, at least."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, I have a few
thoughts for when we as pilots next meet, this conversation has just added
something new to that. Time to turn the AEU corps around and see if we can find
some purpose we can all put ourselves behind."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah you always need
three in a Gem to handle Turtles. Sorry that I wasn't available but getting
Morris to listen to anybody but himself woud be uncertain."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It wasn't his fault,
Lily. And when I asked him to be that third person he immediately came to help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The third person in a
gemini thing is a logical deduction, really. I mean, what the heck else are you
going to do? Send one person in, and they'll immediately get overwhelmed, more
than likely. Send both pilots, and the gemini is vulnerable. So you need a
third."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Exactly."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ather which suits did
you and Liam use?"

around."

around."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Never really used the
same thing twice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We experimented."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ah ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Melinda was the
person who insisted that a person in a fighter would be sufficient decoy to
protect my gem. Nicolette agreed with her, partly. I was not convinced. And in
the end, I am held responsible for what happens with my ships, not Melinda,
Nicolette or Morris."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Good call."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Melinda's argument
yesterday was that this thrall had to be dealt with quickly. Although I in no
way dispute that enemy ships should be handled expediantly, the rush yesterday
let to inefficiency, which ultimately was just as bad if not worse. To my
knowledge, belt of Orion is not along any trading routes, no one was
interdicted, and no ships were at risk of blowing up, so a few more minutes to
make sure everyone knew what to do and was comfortable in that role would
ultimately have lead to success, when now we failed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "A bit more patience
was definitely erquired, to be sure."

received 105,783.37 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a

lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
