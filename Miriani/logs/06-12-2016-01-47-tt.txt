Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small black cooler, a bottle of peach schnapps, a
bottle of expensive cognac, a white time meter, a cream plastic box labeled
'Space Imager Photos', Kosmo the humanoid service robot, and a Tardick lizard
named Raissa here.
Nathaniel Owens is sleeping on a black leather sectional sofa. Sakura Arakida is
sleeping on the floor.
Anfisa of Marzore is dozing on a modern white pod chair. Akemi Bando is sitting
on a modern white pod chair. Blake Madison and Michael Winters are dozing on a
rare black EAOSian contoured couch. Morris Corlew is standing here. Simon
Collins and Melinda Michaels are dozing on a black leather sectional sofa. Nissi
Valdaire and Lily Kaise are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go southeast, southwest, and out.

Other Upgrades:
Decoy Beacon Launcher 5,000,000.00 (AFW Command equipment requisition)
Requirements: none
The decoy beacon launcher is a device that people generally tend to install on
many of their well-armed ships. These launchers after being loaded with the
necessary decoy beacons bought from the same spot as the launchers themselves
have the ability to launch different-level signal strength beacons which will
attract outsider or IFS patrols. This is generally done to prevent them from
actually stumbling their ways into alliance sectors and causing trouble.
Obviously, the stronger the signal, the stronger the enemy response is likely to
be. For example, you will get more ships responding to your high-strength signal
beacon than you will to your standard-strength signal beacons. Note: do not
launch decoy beacons in Mutuality space. Read the pilot's guide to preparation
for more information regarding the reasons why.
Airlock chime 10,000.00 (Sold at any Supply Store)
Requirements: none
This chime will alert you whenever your ship's hatch is opened. So, presumably,
whenever someone enters your ship. Obviously, you have to be inside to hear the
chime. Like most upgrades, it will need to be bolted down in the control room of
your ship.
Gunnery Report Unit 500000.00 (sold at any supply store)
Requirements: none
The gunnery report unit allows the ship to track the number of hits made by each
weapons room against an enemy ship and to display those results to all in the
ship when the enemy ship has been destroyed. You must bolt the gunnery report
unit into the control room of your starship. If it disappears, don't be alarmed,
it has just integrated itself into the ship systems. Do not install a second
one.
Flightlockers 25,000,000.00 (torus Infamous Andy's Ham, Hot Dogs, And Ready Room
Supplies)
Requirements: none
These flightlockers are lockers that you would bolt into the airlock of your
starship, allowing yourself and any pilots that go anywhere with you to store
those bulky flightbags rather than always wearing them on your person. Both
storing and retrieving your flightbags is a delightfully quick process!
Outsider Battle Thrall Translation Interface 1000000.00 (AFW Command Aftermarket
Hardware)
Requirements: none
The translation interface allows a ship to decode any transmitions sent by
Battle Thrall (or Children of the Sun) ships into pictures, which is their main
mode of communication. It also allows a ship to respond in kind using the usual
methods of general sector communication.
Anomaly Detector 5,000,000.00 (Space Vermin Patrol Command Anti-Vermin
Equipment)
Requirements: 5 exploration points
Though I have not yet had an opportunity to test this, I have been told that it
detects and stops for anomalous objects more commonly labeled "other objects" on
one's starmap and/or rundown display.
Viral Injection Pylon Launcher 5,000,000.00 (The torus underground resistance
Viral Injection Pylons)
Requirements: 50 space combat points
The viral injection pylon launchers are mainly used in times of warfare. During
the initial outsider ocupation, we used these launchers to get our sector flight
control towers back under the control of our alliances. It is also likely
possible to use the viral pylons to take sector control from an enemy alliance
during times of warfare as well, though this has not yet been tested. Obviously,
you will need to buy and load viral pylons to launch when you utilize your
launcher. Otherwise it will just sit there and look as pretty as a decoration.
Revo Developmental Technologies Applied Bolt Cannon 132000000.00 (Endymion Revo)
Requirements: 1500 combat points
The bolt cannon is capable of launching two different types of projectiles. The
disarming bolt is aimed specifically at the weapon systems of an enemy ship, and
has the potential to destroy a light turret or heavy launcher with a single
shot, as well as minimizing weapon effectiveness for a time. The disabling bolt
is aimed specifically at the drive section of a ship, causing damage to the FTL
drive or destroying it altogether, as well as potentially causing the enemy ship
to be unable to FTL out of a sector for a time. Note: your ship must not be
moving when you attempt to utilize the bolt cannon.
Rescue Pod Handshaking Protocol 280000000.00 (Tandem Station S & S Ships
Upgrades)
Requirements: 2000 Space Combat Points.
Ever found yourself on a fighter launched from something like, an expeditionary
starship? Ever been worried while on that fighter that you might explode and go
on a pod ride all the way home all by yourself? Well, if your expedition vessel
has this upgrade, you will no longer have to worry about this, because if you
explode violently, your escape pod will tag the vessel it launched from as its
homing beacon, and deposit your pod neatly inside of its docking bay!
Docking Bay Expansion 10 golden tael (Famous Andy's Trading Post Space-Makers)
Requirements: 3000 industry points.
this upgrade gives you an approximate 20% increase to your ship's docking bay.
However, be careful when installing it, because it will also increase the number
of units your own ship will take up in a docking bay accordingly. Note: ask
other pilots about the location of Famous Andy's Trading Post, as it is not
reachable via the normal FTL beacon networks. You may also have to ask pilots
for further information about golden Taels.
Many specialized Glyphmaker upgrades as well as other starship upgrades via the
starship utilities license available can give your ship some useful
enhancements. Some of these include artifact detectors and storage compressors,
while others might include wormhole drive tracers and methods for faster airlock
cycling time. These upgrades can only be gotten from other pilots. Ask around
for further information. Note: When you bolt those, they will also not be shown
in the control room with the wormhole drive tracer as the exception, because
they will be integrated into the ship systems. Do not be alarmed or try to bolt
down more of them. You can check which ones you already have by glancing at the
status readout of your ship.
You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.
A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly southeast.

Other Stations:
Tom Town Thermal Shielding Energy Reclamation System five golden tael (Tom Town
Station Clarence's Workshop)
Requirements: 900 exploration points.
This addition to your battery will reclaim the heat given off from your power
system, and turn it into additional power as well. The up side to this is that
it may work on smaller exploration-class vessels and allow them to go further
than normal. However, it will take up about 5% of your cargo capacity.
Obviously, this upgrade has not yet been tested to figure out what ships it can
and can't be installed on. It definitely can't be put onto a capsule, since it
has no storage hold. Note: this upgrade requires the currency of Feng Wo taels
in order to be purchased. Ask other pilots for information about these taels, as
well as the location of Tom Town Station.
Solar Panel Hull Plating 50 golden tael (Feng Wo Charging of Stars Utilization)
Requirements: 1250 exploration points.
This addition to your hull plating will give your ship the ability to recharge
wherever there might be some solar luminosity available. The higher the level of
luminosity, the faster you can probably expect your ship to recharge. However,
this method of recharging, like the blast furnace also has a wear level. So,
you'll want to be careful when utilizing it. This upgrade can be pretty much
installed on any ship, including ones with a rift impeller. However, it cannot
be installed on a ship that already has a blast furnace. Note: ask other pilots
about the location of Feng Wo, as it is not reachable by the normal FTL beacon
network. Same goes for the golden tael.
Nouveau Quebec Public Industries Flowmill(tm) Charge Turbine 700,000,000.00
(Nouveau Quebec Starship Upgrades)
Requirements: 1500 exploration points
This upgrade which is provided by Nouveau Quebec allows a ship to spin turbines
in a sense, while it's inside the riftflow to either save charge, or incraese
charge. One of the two. The point is, when this is installed on your ship and
you are inside the riftflow, your charge will increase significantly, depending
on the speed at which your ship is traveling. In other words, the faster you
travel, the more charge your ship holds. This upgrade cannot be installed on
ships that have impellers installed on them by all indications, nor can it
seemingly be installed if you have something like a sensor dampener already
installed on your ship. Ask pilots regarding the location of Nouveau Quebec
station, as it cannot be reached via the normal FTL beacon network.
You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate

You press a silver button on the front of a large red popcorn popper with chrome
accents, and several dozen unpopped corn kernels fall into the machine's
microwave popping bin. The microwave switches on, and the kernels begin popping.
A blower activates, sweeping the popped popcorn up and around the bin where
waving nozzles spray them thoroughly with the desired flavorings, incidentally
leaving quite a mess on the walls of the popping bin, but as the finished
popcorn is sucked into a small red and white paper bag that has sprung up from
the bowels of the machine, a mechanical arm tipped with a squeegee emerges and
cleans the walls of the bin, afterwards grabbing the bag, thrusting it into your
waiting hand, and disappearing whence it came. For a brief moment the jubilant
cacophony of a choir of singing elves can be heard in the distance; then the
sound fades away, and the machine shuts down with a quiet wheeze.
