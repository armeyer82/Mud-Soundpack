-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.
You can go east.

21:41:42 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

21:41:44 There appear to be about 25 pilots recently active.

21:42:08 I see no "lily" here.

21:42:17 You say, "Kiska follow."

21:42:18 Kiska the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "Order confirmed."

21:42:19 Kiska the humanoid service robot stops following you.

21:42:21  You are wearing a blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a red cotton pajama top and a pair of red cotton pajama bottoms. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

21:42:21 You are carrying a "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles" key in your right hand.

21:42:26 You slide a "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles" key onto a keychain.

21:42:35 You can't go that way.

21:44:03 You grin.

21:44:05 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:44:08 Morris Corlew asks, "Unioner?"

21:44:15 Eli Grey shrugs.

21:44:30 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

21:44:30 A readout shows Pre-Stellar Object 4653-1077 about 1.12 light-trade cycles toward Galactic North and Up.
A riftstorm appears to be 1.31 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Westsouthwest and Down.

21:46:51 Damien straightens up and proclaums in a theatrical voice, "Harken to me all ye AEUers! today we shall pour drinks without spilling a drop."

21:46:57 I don't understand that.

21:46:59 Eli says to you, "Found some planets in the middle of the night."

21:47:06 Eli Grey says, "Don't know if you've been up since then."

21:47:11 Melinda Michaels waves to you and grins at Damien Goss.

21:47:14 You exclaim, "Nice!"

21:47:14 Morris Corlew asks, "What, AEUer?"

21:47:21 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

21:47:24 Morris Corlew taps a metallic silver touch einrophone and nods to you.

21:48:09 Damien Goss finishes off a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

21:48:14 Damien Goss gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

21:49:07 Eli Grey examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

21:54:30 Jason Rat presses a button on an orange digital felo game.

21:54:31 An orange digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

21:55:34 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

21:55:41 Eli Grey asks, "Everyone holding up ok?"

21:55:48 You nod. "Yep."

21:55:50 You grin.

21:56:17 Eli Grey nods. "Good, good."

21:56:20 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

21:56:36 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:00:40 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

22:01:03 Eli sips a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar noisily.

22:01:14 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

22:01:32 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

22:02:02 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

22:02:12 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

22:02:26 Eli Grey exclaims, "Alright!"

22:02:36 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:03:28 Eli looks over the edge and waves at the passing houses.

22:03:37 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Eli Grey yells, "Hey there rift people!"

22:04:47 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Be right back!"

22:04:48 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

22:04:48 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

22:05:09 Morris says to Eli, "Wait till the castle comes into view."

22:05:09 Damien Goss says, "Quick everyone hide."

22:05:10 Morris Corlew grins.

22:05:13 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:05:15 Morris Corlew lifts an unobtrusive panel and makes his way into the starship's network of system ducts.

22:05:19 Eli Grey laughs.

22:05:22 Eli Grey says, "Yeah,e veryone into the ducts."

22:05:27 A panel suddenly moves aside.  A moment later, Morris Corlew arrives from the starship's network of systems ducts.

22:05:29 Morris Corlew says, "Forgot."

22:05:31 Morris Corlew gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

22:05:35 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:05:38 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:05:38 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:06:03 Eli says to Morris, "Would have bee pretty great, especially if we could get everyone organized enough to do it."

22:06:09 Eli Grey laughs.

22:06:14 Morris Corlew grins.

22:06:24 Damien Goss removes a metal container from a duffel bag made of recycled PVC piping.

22:06:27 Damien Goss removes an old brass lamp from a metal container.

22:06:30 Morris Corlew says, "I wouldn't do that to Nissi though...however, she'd probably figure it out pretty quickly."

22:06:30 Damien Goss spits on a bit of clothing that he is wearing and rubs at a tarnished spot on an old brass lamp.

22:06:38 A thin stream of smoke wisps out from an old brass lamp.

22:06:54 Damien Goss says, "I wish for a fourteen planetary system."

22:06:59 Morris Corlew grins.

22:07:01 Damien Goss puts an old brass lamp in a metal container.

22:07:06 Damien Goss puts a metal container in a duffel bag made of recycled PVC piping.

22:07:06 Eli Grey looks at Damien Goss thoughtfully.

22:07:18 Damien says to Eli, "Want to try?"

22:07:21 Luja Garland stands up.

22:07:34 Vernos Bailey says, "At least we missed the chaotic storm."

22:07:34 Luja Garland exclaims, "Should sleep. See you later!"

22:07:38 Luja Garland waves.

22:07:38 Damien Goss waves to Luja Garland.

22:07:40 Eli Grey grins at Luja Garland.

22:07:40 Luja Garland steps south.

22:07:41 Morris Corlew waves.

22:07:41 Eli Grey waves.

22:08:48 Eli says to Damien, "Maybe later?"

22:08:51 Damien Goss nods.

22:09:09 Eli Grey says, "Is that something specific to this riftscape? You seem to wait until now."

22:09:14 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

22:09:23 Damien Goss says, "Nah, just don't make many wishes."

22:09:44 Morris Corlew grins.

22:09:46 Damien Goss says, "It's just a prop for the three wishes game in the book."

22:09:47 Anfisa of Marzore stumbles in from the south.

22:09:54 Morris Corlew waves to Anfisa of Marzore.

22:09:56 Eli Grey says, "OH! I see."

22:10:03 Damien Goss says, "Just like."

22:10:03 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Hello. I am going to get food now."

22:10:05 Damien Goss removes a metal container from a duffel bag made of recycled PVC piping.

22:10:11 Damien Goss removes a fuzzy stuffed donkey from a metal container.

22:10:13 Eli Grey waves to Anfisa of Marzore.

22:10:14 Anfisa of Marzore stumbles east.

22:10:17 Damien Goss says, "This is for find the ass game."

22:10:27 Damien Goss puts a fuzzy stuffed donkey in a metal container.

22:10:31 Eli Grey finishes off a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

22:10:48 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

22:10:49 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:10:49 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

22:10:55 Morris Corlew waves to Nissi Valdaire.

22:11:10 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

22:11:28 Damien Goss says, "I've got several things in here just for fun."

22:11:49 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:11:59 Damien Goss says, "A fair number of costumes, extra props for whatever, some puppets, tarot cards, and the like."

22:12:11 Damien Goss puts a metal container in a duffel bag made of recycled PVC piping.

22:12:23 Morris Corlew says, "Ouija board can be fun in the rift."

22:12:43 Damien Goss says, "Never tried that."

22:13:04 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

22:15:01 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

22:15:07 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

22:15:11 Morris Corlew smiles. "It's...entertaining."

22:23:15 A Tardick lizard named Thor turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:32:03 A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the distance.

22:33:45 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:34:13 Morris Corlew says, "Those birds are awesome."

22:35:14 Anfisa of Marzore stumbles in from the east.

22:35:16 Anfisa of Marzore sits down on a white leather sofa.

22:37:20 Aisling the Fox waves to Anfisa of Marzore.

22:37:50 Anfisa of Marzore says, "I ate noodles."

22:38:26 Aisling the Fox says, "Noodles are good."

22:38:27 Aisling the Fox nods.

22:38:37 Morris Corlew says, "Agreed."

22:38:57 Morris pats his stomach. "They just don't make keeping the bloat off very easy for me."

22:40:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Bloaty."

22:40:42 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:42:19 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

22:43:45 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

22:43:54 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Sending extended observation probe into your guts."

22:44:02 Morris Corlew looks at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec thoughtfully.

22:44:07 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

22:45:10 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

22:49:05 You blink heavily and then doze off.

22:51:18 Eli Grey blinks heavily and then dozes off.

22:54:21 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

22:55:11 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:56:12 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

22:57:11 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:59:08 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

23:04:26 The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.

23:04:48 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

23:04:58 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

23:04:59 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:05:17 Morris Corlew says, "Aww. Never got to see the castle."

23:05:26 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

23:05:41 Ather Jammoa asks, "Icy's castle?"

23:05:44 Morris Corlew says, "Nah."

23:05:49 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Icyyyyyyyy!"

23:06:04 Morris Corlew says, "Sometimes when we're on the floating island you can see this castle. It's pretty awesome."

23:06:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh that thing."

23:06:26 Morris Corlew says, "Yes, that thing. You make it sound like it's mundane."

23:06:27 Morris Corlew chuckles.

23:07:09 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly. "Dunno. Just guess I get so use to them."

23:08:17 "Makes sense." Morris Corlew nods. "I guess...it's still not mundane to me. None of it."

23:09:09 Ather Jammoa says, "Wow, we're going to probably hit that thousand lightyear mark pretty soon."

23:09:14 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

23:09:24 Ather Jammoa says, "Pretty neat that we'll have managed it in only a week or so."

23:09:28 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

23:09:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Less than a week if we hit it tomorrow."

23:09:34 Morris Corlew nods.

23:09:44 Morris Corlew says, "I'd imagine we will unless we hit some really bad flow."

23:09:51 Morris Corlew glances down at his mirror finish chrome wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

23:09:51 Ather Jammoa says, "Heck, les than a week even if we hit it Saturday, but tomorrow seems more likely."

23:09:57 Morris Corlew nods.

23:10:05 Morris Corlew says, "Four days if we hit it my midnight tomorrow night."

23:10:15 Morris Corlew says, "By even."

23:11:04 Ather Jammoa nods.

23:11:07 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

23:11:07 Ather Jammoa strides east.

23:11:08 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

23:11:49 Ather Jammoa strides in from the east.

23:11:52 Ather Jammoa twists the bottom of a closed cup of beef stew upward, activating the internal self-heating mechanism.

23:12:02 The bottom of a closed cup of beef stew pops back out as its self-heating is completed.

23:12:08 Ather Jammoa pulls the lid off a hot cup of beef stew.

23:12:10 Ather Jammoa takes a few big flavorful spoonfuls from a hot cup of beef stew.

23:12:58 Ather Jammoa takes a few more spoonfuls of a hot cup of beef stew.

23:14:10 Ather Jammoa takes a few more spoonfuls of a hot cup of beef stew.

23:14:16 Ather Jammoa abandons his spoon and slurps down the last of a hot cup of beef stew, draining the cup.

23:14:23 Ather Jammoa gives a foam cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

23:14:25 Ather Jammoa carefully unwraps a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

23:14:44 Ather Jammoa says, "Woo peanutbutter."

23:15:55 Morris Corlew grins. "Better than peanut, butter, and jelly."

23:16:03 Ather hmms.

23:16:08 Ather Jammoa says, "Actually that doesn't sound so bad."

23:16:30 Ather Jammoa says, "But I think I'd rather grind the peanut into the peanut butter, then add the butter, and the jelly."

23:16:35 Ather Jammoa says, "So, you have butter, peanut butter and jelly."

23:16:42 Morris Corlew says, "I'd take butter and jelly, or peanut and jelly even, like...in the case of crunchy peanutbutter. But...not all 3. Even peanut butter and butter can be good."

23:17:02 Ather Jammoa says, "Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are an artform."

23:17:07 Ather Jammoa says, "Once, when I was..."

23:17:14 Ather cuts off his words, glances around, shrugs and continues.

23:17:26 Morris Corlew laughs.

23:17:33 Morris says to Ather, "80 years ago yes?"

23:17:40 Ather Jammoa says, "Once when Frosty and I had a bit too much haze to smoke, I made probably the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich ever. Since then, I have tried t oreplicate it and failed every single time."

23:18:02 Morris Corlew says, "You and Icy smoking haze. Interesting picture."

23:18:02 Morris Corlew grins.

23:18:05 Ather Jammoa says, "No, no."

23:18:07 Ather Jammoa says, "Frosty."

23:18:11 Morris Corlew says, "Frosty...yeah sorry."

23:18:13 Morris Corlew asks, "Frosty?"

23:18:17 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Yes!"

23:18:18 Morris Corlew asks, "Who's Frosty?"

23:18:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Fringe ace pilot I fought alongside long ago."

23:18:35 Morris taps his temple. "Yeah, sorry, had Icy on the brain for some reason."

23:18:38 Morris Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa.

23:19:07 Morris Corlew says, "Possibly because his reappearance and then immediate disappearance are...interesting, to say the least."

23:19:11 Ather Jammoa says, "Anyway, I've tried everything. The closest I've been able to replicate it is peanut butter, jelly, honey and banana."

23:19:19 Ather Jammoa says, "But there is a missing ingredient."

23:19:24 Morris Corlew asks, "Try adding the haze back into the equation?"

23:19:25 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

23:19:40 Ather hmms.

23:19:47 Ather Jammoa says, "And a recording device. Yes, this could work."

23:19:48 Damien Goss stands up.

23:19:49 Morris Corlew says, "Coulda been the psychotropic effects of the haze that just made it taste so much better."

23:19:54 Morris Corlew asks, "Recording device?"

23:20:04 Damien Goss waves.

23:20:09 Morris Corlew waves to Damien Goss.

23:20:09 Morris Corlew says, "Oh yeah."

23:20:12 Damien Goss says, "I'll be back later."

23:20:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Yes, yes! So I can see what I used to makeoh, you think the haze made it better."

23:20:14 Ather Jammoa nods.

23:20:14 Damien Goss steps south.

23:20:18 Ather Jammoa waves at an expert damage output boost.

23:20:21 Morris says to Ather, "Possibly."

23:20:32 Ather hmms.

23:20:34 Morris Corlew says, "Dunno. I don't do haze myself, so..."

23:20:35 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

23:20:35 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Interesting!"

23:20:56 "Haven't touched it since Frosty." Ather Jammoa chuckles. "He was usually able to procure easily enough."

23:21:11 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:21:49 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean I can get it to trade, but if I open the crates, well, it's going to ultimately end up worthless."

23:21:55 Ather Jammoa says, "Besides."

23:22:01 Ather Jammoa says, "The commercial haze is not as good as the..."

23:22:03 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:22:05 Ather Jammoa says, "Black market haze."

23:22:13 Morris Corlew says, "Sure, sure..."

23:22:14 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

23:23:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Anyway, been off the stuff since he left, and haven't relaly felt the pull to start up again."

23:23:20 Morris Corlew nods and nods.

23:25:19 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

23:25:39 Morris Corlew says, "Zooom."

23:27:33 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

23:27:49 Rogue Romano waves.

23:28:21 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

23:28:24 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

23:28:25 Morris Corlew waves to Rogue Romano.

23:28:37 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:28:54 Ather Jammoa picks up half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and takes a huge bite.

23:29:08 Rogue Romano slinks east.

23:29:30 Rogue Romano slinks in from the east.

23:29:38 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

23:29:44 Rogue Romano carefully unwraps a cheese and pickle sandwich.

23:29:48 Rogue Romano picks up half of a cheese and pickle sandwich and takes a huge bite.

23:31:39 Rogue Romano takes another large bite of a cheese and pickle sandwich.

23:31:59 Ather Jammoa takes another large bite of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

23:32:54 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:33:06 Rogue Romano finishes off half of a cheese and pickle sandwich.

23:33:28 Ather Jammoa finishes off half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

23:34:54 Ather Jammoa starts in on the second half of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

23:35:05 Rogue Romano starts in on the second half of a cheese and pickle sandwich.

23:35:09 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

23:35:32 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

23:35:49 Ather Jammoa takes another large bite of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

23:36:11 Ather Jammoa finishes off the last of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

23:36:22 Ather Jammoa puts down a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

23:37:18 Rogue Romano takes another large bite of a cheese and pickle sandwich.

23:37:31 Eli Grey finishes off a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

23:37:35 Eli Grey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

23:37:41 Rogue Romano finishes off the last of a cheese and pickle sandwich.

23:37:47 Rogue Romano crumples up her stained crinkled sandwich wrapper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

23:37:51 Ather Jammoa strides east.

23:37:54 Rogue Romano navigates her metallic yellow touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:38:23 Rogue Romano switches a metallic yellow touch einrophone off.

23:38:28 Ather Jammoa strides in from the east.

23:38:30 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa.

23:38:32 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

23:41:06 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:41:09 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

23:45:43 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it flashes past a viewport overhead.

23:47:08 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

23:47:09 A riftstorm appears to be 1.44 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic West and Slightly Down.
A chaotic riftstorm appears to be 2.43 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Up.

23:47:53 Eli Grey examines an emerald green ice cream dispenser for a moment.

23:47:57 Eli Grey presses a gold button on the front of an emerald green ice cream dispenser. The contraption hums and gurgles for a moment; then the noise dies away, and a cold cherry cola float is deposited into the dispensing area in the front, which he promptly retrieves.

23:48:06 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

23:48:06 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]

23:48:06 Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings. Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down. Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a large white an

23:48:20 Morris Corlew chuckles.

23:48:33 You grin.

23:48:43 Lily Kaise

23:48:43 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of soft light blue boots. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'A
23:48:43 steria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

23:51:21 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, I know."

23:51:31 Eli Grey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

23:51:36 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Glad he straightened everything out for you!"

23:51:43 Eli says to Ather, "Thanks for the help during all that."

23:51:44 Ather says to Eli, "No weird sideaffects?"

23:51:58 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

23:52:06 Ather says sternly, "Eli?"

23:52:17 Eli Grey says, "Well.. I'm still seeing some things, but it doesn't quite feel the same.. I think it's fading slowly."

23:52:25 Ather Jammoa frowns and nods.

23:52:30 Ather Jammoa says, "Well."

23:52:37 Eli Grey says, "And the doc said my brain was glowing blue."

23:52:40 Ather Jammoa says, "If you're still seeing things when we get back, contact him again."

23:52:43 Morris says to Eli, "Is the thing...gone then or just ah...adjusted?"

23:52:49 Eli says to Morris, "Gone."

23:52:53 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

23:52:56 Ather says to Eli, "That could be because of the stuff you exposed yourself to from the megapod."

23:53:09 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:53:14 Morris says to Eli, "Well hopefully your brain'll go back to normal and you'll stop seein stuff completely."

23:53:16 Morris Corlew says, "Well."

23:53:17 Morris Corlew says, "Uh."

23:53:19 Eli says to Ather, "I'ms ure it is, I just didn't know that it applied to anything inside me."

23:53:22 Morris Corlew says, "Didn't mean exactly that..."

23:53:32 Eli Grey says, "Always just thought it was my skin."

23:53:34 Ather says to Eli, "Of course it does."

23:53:38 Ather Jammoa says, "You saw what it did to Gabrielle."

23:53:42 Eli Grey winces.

23:53:49 Ather Jammoa says, "You hvae to assume that it will have internal as well as external ramifications."

23:54:05 Ather Jammoa says, "Be grateful your situation was not as bad as hers."

23:54:10 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, up close and personal, unfortunately."

23:54:14 Morris Corlew says, "There's not a whole lot that happens to the skin that doesn't have some cause or effect internally."

23:54:38 Morris Corlew says, "Even itchy skin from rollin in the grass has to do with stuff that happens inside."

23:54:39 Morris Corlew shrugs.

23:55:10 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:55:29 Eli Grey says, "I do plan on letting him know when we get back though."

23:55:35 Eli Grey eats a spoonful of drippy ice cream from a cold cherry cola float.

23:56:03 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it flashes past a viewport overhead.

23:56:14 Morris says to Eli, "So...you can tell me to shut up any time...but...the blueness came from drinkin that stuff we sometimes find in a megapod?"

23:56:36 Eli says to Ather, "I also had it in a lot longer than planned, so he said there might be some weirdness."

23:56:42 Ather Jammoa nods.

23:56:46 Eli Grey says, "Mostly he just said no trips Rimward anytime soon."

23:56:48 Ather Jammoa says, "I guess your brain does have to uncross its wires."

23:57:00 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:57:20 Eli says to Morris, "Yeah, I ingested some of it, mostly on accident."

23:57:32 Morris Corlew looks at Eli Grey thoughtfully.

23:57:45 Ather Jammoa says, "It was mostly on accident."

23:57:49 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:58:10 Morris Corlew asks, "A sip was intentional...the rest not?"

23:58:19 Eli Grey says, "Well, it was stupid. Probably shouldn't have been keeping it in the fridge."

23:58:25 Morris Corlew says, "Ahhh. I see."

23:58:26 Morris Corlew grins.

23:58:35 Eli says to Morris, "Nah I dumped the whole thing on a salad."

23:58:40 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

23:58:43 Ather Jammoa says, "He put it on food, wasn'tright."

23:58:45 Ather Jammoa nods.

23:58:51 Eli shakes his head, looking embarrassed.

23:58:52 Ather Jammoa sighs at Eli Grey.

23:59:08 Morris Corlew says, "I wonder if the time spent in chilled temperatures might have caused the different effect to Gabrielle."

23:59:12 Morris Corlew pats Eli Grey on the back. "We all do...things."

23:59:13 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

23:59:17 Ather says to Morris, "Na."

23:59:23 Eli Grey says, "Ather's right for sure, though. I lucked out big time compared to Gabrielle and Adrian."

23:59:25 Ather Jammoa says, "We've noticed that the tubes apparently differ in design."

23:59:28 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

23:59:49 Morris says to Ather, "Ah. I've only seen a couple. Seemed to look the same but I didn't get a close look at either one really."

23:59:52 Ather Jammoa says, "The other person he mentioned, Adrian, he started to sport mushroom-like kinda growths."

23:59:58 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.
