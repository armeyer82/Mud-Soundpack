["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

23:12 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:12 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

23:12 The computer announces, "The destination Sector 5 is 19 sectors east, 5536 sectors south, and 4078 sectors down."

23:12 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

23:12 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a mass of frozen carbon monoxide mixed with rock."

Seven of a mass of frozen carbon monoxide mixed with rock.
Nine of a small glowing crystal.

23:15 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:15 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

23:15 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

23:15 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a small glowing crystal."

23:30 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

23:30 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

23:35 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

23:35 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

23:35 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a lifeform and a mass of frozen carbon monoxide mixed with rock."

23:35 You deftly draw a stun turret from a soft black leather stun weapon holster.

23:35 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

A fuzzy creature lets out a pitiful screech before collapsing to the ground. It lifts its head weakly, staring at you with black, beady, watery eyes for a moment before wobbling and dropping its head, completing its life.

23:36 You deftly insert a stun turret into a soft black leather stun weapon holster.

23:36 You pick a fuzzy corpse up off of the ground.

23:36 You carefully place a fuzzy corpse into a purple velvet artifact storage container.

23:36 You flick a switch to enable condensed autopilot and debris display modes.
