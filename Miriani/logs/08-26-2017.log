This is a large room with baby blue and pink velvet carpet flecked with yellow and gold glitter. Each wall is made of sky blue and baby pink tile. High in the fourth wall there is a stained-glass window. With ocean blue lace curtains. Which when open, provide a wonderful view of the back deck and the lush woods beyond the small cabin. Near the window is a cherry blossom and beaded window seat.
