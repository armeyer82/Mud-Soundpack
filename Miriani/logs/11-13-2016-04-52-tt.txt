Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and yellow aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black upholstered
sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft black shamak fur, a small blueberry
trash bin, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an
insulated green cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a red plastic food storage
container, a small blue ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Kiwi
the little calico CatBot, a black plastic tray of spider chow, Ciera the
humanoid service robot, and Meow the little calico CatBot here.
Johann Rowan is standing here. Lily Kaise is sitting on a black upholstered
sofa.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a black upholstered sofa.)
Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers
Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

keep at least a pair in reserve."

important to know? I know about bowing and all."

follow your lead until I get familiar with the culture."

squeeze lily
You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I certainly don't plan to be rude to her
as after all, she has traveled a long way in a capsule."

capsule, go home, do your thing, then come right back."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Still they sure don't get it and they
certainly don't understand what my job is."
Johann Rowan nods.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But yeah, whatever you feel is best."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Melinda should know better than that by
now too."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Akemi well she is over-zealous about
everything and gets into some rigid mindsets and I think it's her lack of
experience showing there."
Lily Kaise shrugs.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I agree, she's very oppinionated."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Granted, I like her a lot, but we do
disagree on some things."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh I like Akemi too but she is too quick
to react at times."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "True, but better to be quick and decisive
than slow and vassalating."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Bogey L8L2B at Up and Slightly
Southsoutheast: "Halloo all travelers! Please to visit Famous Andy's Trading
Post! Purchase fine imported items from alliances! Resupply! Rest a while!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Also Johann, I'm not insensitive to what
has happened. I just believe taht the media has grabbed their opportunity to
exploit certain perceptions. You know too, we hear of our citizens getting
mugged and otherwise in Fringe, League and Mutuality and look what ather has
experienced out here with Granny Tang and company."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I have no clue what happened."
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh well I only witnissed one incident
but she apparently thinks he is someone else and she will grab her victim and
uses this needle full of some kind of drugs and it's inserted... well in a very
personal area and so it renders the person unable to do anything. Then."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Bet Ather wishes he was more robotic than
he is."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So they shoved him into a cargo
container on Andy's and some ship picked it up thinking it was one of their
containers and so we had to go on a wild trek to Feng Wo to rescue him."
Johann Rowan chuckles.
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "It was crazy!"
'wow!
You exclaim, "Wow!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That's how he got Skipper."
A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Part of me thinks it would have been
funny to leave him there a while and let him stew."
Johann Rowan grins.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The cargo container had the lizard, a
sofa, teacakes and some other htings in it so Ather and Skipper ate teacakes and
hoped for somethign I guess."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Tea cakes."
Johann Rowan grins.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'll never forget us prying that
container open."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Bogey L8L2B at Up and Slightly
Southsoutheast: "Halloo all travelers! Please to visit Famous Andy's Trading
Post! Purchase fine imported items from alliances! Resupply! Rest a while!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm just glad we were able to rescue
him. Ather was also grabbed by Granny Tang a long time ago before I became a
pilot and I don't know anything about that incident."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I think that was actually on Feng Wo
Station."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Well, if their letting people know
there's alliance stuff to get here, they shouldn't be that hostile. It could
hurt their trade."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yes it could."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "You're probably safe here, but Tom Town
or Feng Wo could be more dicy."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But as I say they mistook Ather for
someone who has a bounty on them I think. I wish I could remember the name."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Either that or they are on the run out

small space station, glinting in the eons-old reflected starlight.  Mostly
docking bay, the living areas are almost hidden underneath the large boxy

appear to dot almost every surface of the mismatched steel plating.

You peer out...
[Famous Andy's Trading Post; Docking Bay]
Though Andy's Trading Post is located in the proverbial middle of nowhere, the
docking bay is large by any standard, accommodating a good number of
rickety-looking carriers and transports surrounded by swarms of workers,
well-armed security guards, and sprawling piles of crated cargo. The bay is
roughly square and is enclosed by walls formed of a patchwork of steel plates
with more laid overhead into a high flat ceiling, each plate held in place by
large bolts and thick, lumpy welds. Metal lattices cover the walls, ceiling, and
deck, keeping tangles of cables and grimy ductwork safely out of the way. A
massive airlock on the south side of the bay allows starship arrivals and
departures, while a ramp leads downward from the north side, where a very large
poster is prominently displayed. Wide hatches lead into corridors extending east
and west. The oil-scented air here is a bit smoky, and the gravity is
approximately two-thirds of Earth standard.
The galleon "Queen Brynn II" is landed here.
You see a Feng Wo Collective service robot, a large recycle bin, a man in a
voice-changing oxygen mask, a lady in a sequined gown, a woman wearing garlands
of artificial flowers, a tall hooded figure, a smiling young woman, and a man
standing next to a large cargo hauler here.
You can go east, west, and down.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I don't see Sean."

Though Andy's Trading Post is located in the proverbial middle of nowhere, the
docking bay is large by any standard, accommodating a good number of
rickety-looking carriers and transports surrounded by swarms of workers,
well-armed security guards, and sprawling piles of crated cargo. The bay is
roughly square and is enclosed by walls formed of a patchwork of steel plates
with more laid overhead into a high flat ceiling, each plate held in place by
large bolts and thick, lumpy welds. Metal lattices cover the walls, ceiling, and
deck, keeping tangles of cables and grimy ductwork safely out of the way. A
massive airlock on the south side of the bay allows starship arrivals and
departures, while a ramp leads downward from the north side, where a very large
poster is prominently displayed. Wide hatches lead into corridors extending east
and west. The oil-scented air here is a bit smoky, and the gravity is
approximately two-thirds of Earth standard.

You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.
A readout shows Pre-Stellar Object 3141-0475 about 13.68 light-grand cycles
toward Galactic North and Down.
A phasing riftstorm appears to be 1.43 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic
Southeast and Up.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The distance is probably on the
elevation."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch
on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Which is as we move up, we're getting
seemingly closer so depending on how far Southeast it is."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I'm hoping it's more on the horrizontal.
The heading you gave me is mostly up."
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Yeah no kidding!"
Lily Kaise grins.
grin
You grin.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "If my guess is correct though, we should
pass within between 0.5 and 0.7 ltc's of it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Now if storms had designations, we'd
know if this was the same phasing storm we encountered from a different
direction perhaps where nothing else in the way of a point of interest was
discernable."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "No, that was way west and down."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Unless it moved this far."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "It was moving in this direction."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I don' tknow as I'm not certain if
they have a lifespan or if they move or some move and such as that."
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Well, maybe one day when I'm not trying
to get anywhere, I'll sit at 1 trim and watch a storm."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Hahaha."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Actually, that would be an interesting
thing to observe."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I have to say, I ran into one in my
hauler coming back from 285. It got me home in about three minutes."
'Yeah, they can sure speed things up.
You say, "Yeah, they can sure speed things up."
'But cause a lot of drift.
You say, "But cause a lot of drift."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Johann, I am bad about noting departure
times. What time did we leave Andy's?"
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Umm."
Johann Rowan begins reading in a copy of "queen Brynn, Ship's log".
Lily Kaise laughs.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "About 18:30."

l log
a piece of heavy white stationery with a silver AEU logo at the top [inside a
leather briefcase]
This is a letter. It is addressed to Shule Elemmire, and was sent by Lily Kaise.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Keep in mind though we're maybe going
about 1100 light minutes per second, and this is the fastest we've gone all
day."
Lily Kaise nods.
Johann Rowan exclaims in a German accent, "We've only gone 4.5 ltc's!"
Lily Kaise nods.
Johann Rowan activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive
detections and recent ping returns.
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "So in another 4 or 5 hours max,
we'll be there woo!"
Lily Kaise laughs.
Johann Rowan nods.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and
a green glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with violet petals.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "My thinking is then, we can do whatever
trading you want to do there, then we'll head out to the field, and you can
launch your siteseers. I would personally probably go back to tom town when you
want to sleep, and recharge, and when we are ready to go, just tell me."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah make sure charge is full and then
when we are running low on charge, we can go back to Tom Town, unload the
Sightseers and allow everyone to recharge and go back for another pass or
whatever everyone wants to do."
nod
You nod.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "That or, you can just take the siteseers
back if you want too. It's only about 22 lightyears or so."
Johann Rowan exclaims in a German accent, "It will be like a trip to the
bubble!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If there's good charge on the Galleon
still, we could also take turns in the galleon to save the trek back but we'd
still need to recharge."
Johann Rowan nods.
A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and
a green glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea
fern.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Whatever you guys want to do. We'll make
it work."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yep can do that as well but would save
their charge if they don't have to shuttle back and forth and I've seen some bad
flow going in that direction before."
Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anyway, we'll figure it out."
Lily Kaise grins.
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "I think the best option is to stay
together as much as possible, if we get separated on timetables or whatever,
just meet back at Tom Town. We have hypercasters on all the ships I assume?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I do but we're not going to be out in
our sightseers 24 by 7 so we should just dock when ready to sleep via the
beacon."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Okay, then if I sleep before you guys for
whatever, just dock your ship and take the galleon."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Shule and I generally are ready to sleep
around the same time frame so we can work around that."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That also saves us charge on the
sightseers and we can stay out longer."
Johann Rowan nods.
Johann Rowan activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive
detections and recent ping returns.
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "Any other landmarks we should be on the
lookout for?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Mine has a day and 16 hours and I think
Shules 36 hours so we might get 2 to 2 and a half days each depending on how
long we stay out both days. I'd say probably a good 2 and a half days though."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If you take out about 8 hours two times,
that's 16 hours saved while we sleep."
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "Then, just looking ahead, going home, do
we want to go straight from Tom Town, or do we want to stop at Andy's as a
landmark then head straight north?"
Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo wanders in from the south.
Johann Rowan strokes a small blueberry trash bin lovingly.
Johann Rowan strokes the soft feathers of Blueberry the hefty violet feathered
felo.
Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo purrs softly.
'My what?
You ask, "My what?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well we could leave from Tom Town. It's
jsut going to be a little more dicey but it would save time. Just depends on
what everyone wants to do. I'm ok with whatever you want to do."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Well, working out the angle to get home
won't be hard."
Lily Kaise nods.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
'Well, we can leave from Tom Town if we use a slight down elevation.
You say, "Well, we can leave from Tom Town if we use a slight down elevation."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The only other aspect is if we decided
to use the Blast Furnace while artifacting, we'd want to get it repaired before
the trek back."
Lily Kaise stands up from a black upholstered sofa.
Lily Kaise glides south.

be able to stay out a bit longer with the sightseers."
Johann Rowan asks in a German accent, "So, who's comfortable with trig?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I estimate that we'd probably be out
there around 15 or so hours each max just depends."
Johann Rowan nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not in my head and not as much anymore
but I certainly understand it."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Right, I forget what function I need to
find the angle of a hypotenuse."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'd need one of those briefing books or
a good computer which we don't have access to."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "I should have kept that box of abacuses."
Lily Kaise chuckles.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "So here's what I know."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Our trip out is roughly 77.4 lightyears.
andy's is 300 lightyears from home. If we left from Tom town, it would be a
total of 309.823756352 lightyears."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Roughly yes."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's not going to always be so exact due
to drift and other aspects."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, roughly. We are heading a bit east
as well, so it's not exact, but it's close."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Stopping off to recharge if needed or at
a point of itnerest skews it a bit."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Still, not accounting for drift. I'm
trying to find the angle to get home."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "If we went straight."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well we went straight up for 10 LTC."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Right that's 77.4 lightyears."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "That's the one leg."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "The other leg is 300 lightyears."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So that is prt of the original formula
factored in."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "More or less."
Lily Kaise nods.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "So using the pythagorean theorum, I got
that long number for the hypotenuse."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "309.823756352."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "But it's not exactly straight either."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "No, It will be close enough."
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The angle from Andy's is going to bend
too."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "So, the sine of 77.4 and 309.823756352 is
0.249835, but I don't remember my next step."
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The angle from Andy's is going to bend
too'ok well I know have had to adjust to very slightly down before. Or up before
depending on drift."
Johann Rowan nods.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Heh, it's not going to be perfect."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Nope."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That's what charting does for you
though."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "But it will cut off about 80 lightyears."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It should."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Because we'd have to backtrack down and
then go essentially straight."
Johann Rowan nods.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "So, it could add as much as most of a
waking cycle to our trip."
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Yep but recharge and meat dogs ha
ha!"
Johann Rowan grins.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm just kidding of course."
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "True, but we can go 310 lightyears
without a recharge easy, and close to home there are plenty of things to stop at
if we need it."
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "When I could chart, we went directly
back from Tom town. I will see if I can recall much about that."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'll have plenty of time to reflect
while hunting for presents."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Johann Rowan exclaims in a German accent, "Aha!"
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "It's an angle of 8.06 roughly."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh so not to much of a down elevation
and I seem to recall that."
Johann Rowan nods.
Johann Rowan says in a German accent, "Yeah, well it can't be that much, it's a
long way to go."
Lily Kaise nods.
'I'd vote -2 or -3 on elevation.
You say, "I'd vote -2 or -3 on elevation."
Johann says to you in a German accent, "Well, if someone can check my work."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yep probably no more than -5 and yeah
less to be on the safe side actually."
Johann says to you in a German accent, "How are you at trig?"
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with yellow skin and blue split wings spins

Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Prissy the big violet long-haired felo.
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's
hand, looking up at her adoringly.

attempts to wrestle with a small plastic statue of Benjamin Masterson.

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "One creepy scene to the next."
