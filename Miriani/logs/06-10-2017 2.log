00:00:47 Eli Grey says, "Jeez our speed dropped by half fro a little while ago."

00:00:57 Eli Grey says, "Roughly."

00:01:16 Morris Corlew nods.

00:01:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "So sad."

00:01:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec navigates his royal blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

00:02:00 Eli Grey asks, "Someone put a semi-transparent egg on the offering stump?"

00:02:04 Eli Grey says, "Hmm."

00:02:08 Eli nods thoughtfully.

00:02:08 Morris Corlew asks, "Oh?"

00:02:16 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, look."

00:02:17 Morris Corlew says, "Uh."

00:02:18 Eli Grey points at an ancient moss-covered tree stump.

00:02:22 Morris Corlew says, "Interesting."

00:02:33 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

00:03:01 Damien Goss points at Lily Kaise.

00:03:02 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

00:03:15 Damien Goss says, "She also left one on the table there for whatever reason."

00:03:15 Morris Corlew says, "Ah. Makes sense."

00:03:20 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

00:03:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Offers all to the moss."

00:03:51 Damien says to Morris, "How does that make sense?"

00:03:59 Morris says to Damien, "That it was Lily."

00:04:08 Morris says to Damien, "Because I know she has tons of eggs."

00:04:30 Damien Goss says, "So do I, I don't go around offering up living creatures to rift entities."

00:04:47 Morris says to Damien, "No, just that it was her made sense. Not her motivation."

00:04:53 Morris Corlew shrugs.

00:04:58 Eli Grey says, "It's just an egg, we eat eggs all the time."

00:05:01 Eli Grey shrugs.

00:05:14 Morris says to Eli, "That egg is likely a fertile egg. We don't eat fertile eggs."

00:05:19 Morris says to Eli, "We eat sterile eggs."

00:05:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:05:56 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I respect dietary tastes."

00:06:42 Eli Grey says, "So it's ok to eat an egg, as long as no one has fucked it.. gotcha."

00:07:08 Morris Corlew laughs.

00:07:43 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

00:07:55 Vernos Bailey says, "So I came up with some goals for this trip at least for me."

00:07:59 Luja Garland says, "On the Philippines, we eat fertilized eggs. Though not everyone. Some people think it's gross."

00:08:19 Vernos says to Luja, "That is interesting."

00:08:33 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

00:08:43 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

00:08:48 A black digital felo game emits a beep that slowly descends in tone as the felo goes to sleep.

00:08:48 Luja Garland says, "Right? The yolk isn't yellow."

00:08:53 Vernos Bailey says, "Never tried that before."

00:08:59 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

00:09:47 Damien Goss says, "I'm not judging, but I'll pass. I never really liked eggs very much as food anyway."

00:10:24 Damien Goss says, "I'm more of a bagel and bacon breakfast man myself."

00:10:32 Luja says to Damien, "What do you like eggs as, then?"

00:11:30 Damien Goss says, "I don't really think about it much. They are the continuation of a cycle. I just don't eat them unless I have to."

00:11:41 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

00:11:48 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

00:12:15 Luja Garland says, "Ah."

00:15:41 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:15:50 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

00:17:18 A Tardick lizard named Thor blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:17:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

00:19:41 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

00:22:37 Minor Change: Application ships can no longer be launched when no one aboard qualifies.

00:24:47 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

00:25:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:28:18 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly south.

00:32:22 Luja Garland stands up.

00:32:29 Luja Garland says, "Stretching my legs for a bit."

00:32:32 Luja Garland steps south.

00:33:39 [MTTS] Ulias: On that most recent change, does "qualified" mean that person needs to have been approved through an application as well or are is it just referring to points?

00:33:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:33:52 [MTTS] something: I assume application.

00:33:57 [MTTS] something: That would make sense.

00:34:09 [MTTS] Ulias: It makes the most sense, just thought I'd be sure though.

00:34:10 [MTTS] something: In the same way a cruiser can't launch without a qualified cruiser pilot.

00:34:55 [MTTS] something: Hmm actually it's probably both, cause you can get the application before you have the points.

00:38:34 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

00:39:32 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:41:09 Eli Grey says, "Been a long time since the sensors picked up anything interesting."

00:41:15 Morris Corlew nods.

00:41:19 Eli Grey says, "I bet Pierre was right about us passing up some interesting things."

00:41:21 Eli Grey shrugs.

00:41:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec shrugs helplessly.

00:41:41 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

00:42:02 Morris Corlew says, "I'm sure we do. Not much that can be done about it unfortunately. Storms kill the sensors. Unless we stopped for all storms...which would waste a lot of time when you have no real destination in mind."

00:42:16 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "Must have been the party planet. So much partying generated storms."

00:42:39 Morris Corlew chuckles.

00:45:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Current speed will provide plenty of time to spot things."

00:45:45 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

00:46:38 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Your face is scaring all of the points of interest away. If you cover it up and start looking halfway decent things will inevitably change."

00:47:23 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

00:47:33 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

00:47:57 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

00:48:32 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I think throwing you in furnace will help more."

00:48:57 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

00:49:39 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "It would not. My internal mechanisms will trigger a violent explosion."

00:49:41 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

00:50:06 Morris says to Ather, "You're just tryin to scare him to save yourself."

00:50:13 Ather Jammoa says, "Irrelevant."

00:50:14 Vernos Bailey says to Ather, "I would call that an abrupt short term boost."

00:50:22 Morris Corlew laughs.

00:51:05 Vernos Bailey says, "The end of that boost however outweighs the benefit of the boost."

00:51:28 Morris says to Vernos, "Maybe not."

00:51:29 Morris Corlew grins.

00:51:41 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

00:52:05 Vernos says to Morris, "I need help for help with redefining the name of AEU so it is not so jokingly talked about."

00:52:11 Vernos Bailey says, "His help I mean."

00:52:21 Morris says to Vernos, "He's part of the cause."

00:52:22 Morris Corlew looks at Vernos Bailey and shrugs.

00:52:43 Jason Rat says, "Going to go take a nap."

00:52:50 Morris says to Jason, "Rest well."

00:52:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Rest well Jason."

00:52:59 Jason Rat says, "Thanks."

00:53:05 Jason Rat stands up from a white leather sofa.

00:53:07 Jason Rat jogs south.

00:53:23 Vernos says to Morris, "Need a adquate example then?"

00:53:31 Morris says to Vernos, "Of what?"

00:53:31 Vernos Bailey shrugs.

00:54:02 Morris says to Vernos, "No pilot exists that is the embodiment of what you want the AEU to be. Which is why change just won't happen over night, not in actuality and not in perception."

00:54:38 Vernos Bailey says, "Eh I was just providing reasons not to throw him in the furnace."

00:54:56 Morris says to Vernos, "Even when it does happen in actuality, it'll be awhile it'll take awhile before percep- Oh."

00:56:29 Vernos Bailey nods.

00:57:28 Vernos Bailey says, "How to kill a conversation."

00:57:31 Vernos Bailey says, "Mention the AEU."

00:57:34 Vernos Bailey smirks.

00:57:37 Morris Corlew shrugs.

00:57:44 Morris Corlew says, "Conversations ebb and flow."

00:57:45 Ather says to Vernos, "And you have to remember, I'm not really a prime example to follow. I could genuinely care less what the other alliances think of us. The image of the AEU does need to be improved, but not for the sake of pacifying anyone in particular, just for the sake of the AEU. Though to be honest, with the way things have been shaping up out there with the Outsiders and the Allied pirates in particular, I don't really mind the shift towards military technology development. That doesn't mean tiat I agree with all of President Best's campagne promises. I definitely hope he doesn't try to pull the alliance out of the Accord, for instance, or try to start shit with the other alliances. So far, he hasn't relaly done anything about either."

00:59:24 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

00:59:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:00:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, I would wait until the first hint of those super amazing military toys to be actual made before doing so if I was him."

01:00:43 Ather Jammoa says, "That being said, a lot of the people from the AEU do seem to want to start exploring again, and I got no issue with that personally. They can all do whatever they want. Especially if they actually lead an expedition instead of just talking about leading one, which has been the case for a while now with a few exceptions."

01:01:26 Vernos Bailey says, "Eh my goals for this trip are to get a taste of what expeditions are like. Not piss off people enough to get invited on more in the future and to have a good time while spending time with others."

01:01:35 Ather Jammoa grins at Vernos Bailey.

01:01:42 Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.

01:01:47 Ather says to Vernos, "Don't think you've managed to piss anyone off yet!"

01:02:06 Vernos Bailey says, "I will hold off on checking that off my list until we return."

01:02:36 Vernos Bailey says, "At most, I might be a mild annoyance since my jokes fall flat sometimes."

01:02:42 Ather Jammoa says, "Eh."

01:02:46 Ather Jammoa says, "Everyone's jokes flal flat sometimes."

01:02:56 Damien Goss nods.

01:03:08 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

01:03:12 Damien Goss says, "Lots of mine apparently start out flat."

01:03:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Don't think anyone's going to call you out for a lame joke."

01:03:22 Morris Corlew says, "Mine have a rather high...rate of it."

01:04:48 Luja Garland steps in from the south.

01:04:52 Luja Garland sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:05:42 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:08:16 Morris Corlew nods to Luja Garland.

01:08:22 Luja Garland says, "Hello."

01:09:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Allo."

01:09:49 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

01:09:52 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

01:10:02 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

01:10:29 Morris Corlew says, "Welcome to hell, folks."

01:10:49 Vernos Bailey says, "I thought that was anywhere where all of us existed."

01:10:53 Luja Garland asks, "What does the thing on the gate mean?"

01:10:54 Vernos Bailey smirks.

01:11:13 Morris says to Vernos, "Heh heh heh."

01:11:42 Vernos says to Luja, "Basically those who venture forth are damned and will not return."

01:12:02 Damien Goss says, "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

01:12:12 Luja Garland frowns.

01:12:12 Vernos Bailey says, "What he said."

01:12:21 Vernos Bailey says, "I just loosely translated it."

01:12:41 Morris Corlew says, "It's straight from an Old Earth poem."

01:13:00 Damien Goss says, "Semantics are important. There's a difference between what it says and what you said."

01:13:20 Luja Garland exclaims, "Abandon hope, even if you might make it out just fine!"

01:13:26 Luja Garland says, "Is how I interpret it."

01:13:31 Damien Goss shakes his head.

01:13:37 Morris says to Luja, "Abandon hope for ever leaving too."

01:13:47 Luja Garland says, "Oh."

01:13:47 Morris says to Luja, "Every shred of hope."

01:13:50 Morris Corlew shrugs.

01:14:18 Damien Goss says, "The hope that breakfast will be there tomorow, the hope that your shirt will stay dry, everything. It however does not you are damned."

01:14:32 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.

01:14:43 Damien Goss says, "It just means that if you pass this point you shouldn't expect anything good."

01:15:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Yet lucifer waits at the end."

01:15:38 Morris Corlew nods.

01:15:53 Vernos Bailey says, "I would say that is a pretty good argument for the damned part."

01:15:58 Morris Corlew says, "But...he is also tormented."

01:16:00 Morris Corlew shrugs.

01:16:06 Morris Corlew nods.

01:16:11 Vernos Bailey says, "True."

01:16:16 Luja Garland asks, "Who's tormented? The oarsman?"

01:16:20 Damien Goss says, "Everyone in hell."

01:16:27 Morris Corlew says, "Everyone. Even Satan himself."

01:16:28 Morris Corlew shrugs.

01:16:44 Vernos Bailey says, "Hell was created to torment lucifer the way I see it."

01:17:09 Luja Garland says, "Wow. Sounds like the worst place ever."

01:17:12 Damien Goss says, "And according to some belief systems even a trip to hell is just a passage to atone for your sins before you supposedly are allowed throught he gates of heaven."

01:17:12 Morris Corlew says, "Hell was created for torment of...everyone. Everything. Hell is...lack of hope. hell is pain. Hell is torment and torture."

01:17:14 Morris Corlew nods to Luja Garland.

01:17:19 Vernos Bailey says, "Even he who is the overlord is also a tormented soul in hell."

01:17:21 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.

01:17:24 Aisling the Fox asks, "What are you talking about?"

01:17:41 Luja says to Aisling, "Hell."

01:17:42 Damien Goss says, "Well yeah I mean he was anangel until he became too prideful and was thrust out of heaven."

01:17:48 Morris Corlew nods.

01:18:05 Luja Garland asks, "Who was?"

01:18:09 Luja Garland asks, "The oarsman?"

01:18:10 Damien Goss says, "Lucifer."

01:18:24 Luja Garland asks, "What about Satan?"

01:18:25 Aisling the Fox says, "Not really clear in concept."

01:18:32 Damien Goss says, "They are the same."

01:18:39 Morris Corlew says, "The oarsman is just a worker assisting in trasnport of souls."

01:18:40 Morris Corlew shrugs.

01:18:41 Luja Garland asks, "Literally?"

01:18:44 Damien Goss nods to Luja Garland.

01:19:19 Luja Garland says, "Oh."

01:19:19 Damien Goss says, "He has many names, Lucifer, Satan, Old Cob, The Father of Lies, etcetera."

01:19:33 Luja Garland asks, "Is he the devil?"

01:19:36 Damien Goss nods.

01:19:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:19:54 Morris Corlew says, "Devil, Satan, Lucifer, on and on."

01:20:02 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.

01:20:08 Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:20:16 Aisling the Fox says, "Lots of names for one person."

01:20:19 Damien Goss nods.

01:20:34 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

01:20:38 Luja Garland says, "Yeah. I thought they were two people, and that none of 'em were the oarsman."

01:20:40 Luja Garland frowns.

01:20:50 Damien Goss says, "I think that stems from the fact that nobody wanted to invoke his name so they gave him multiple labels. I could be wrong though."

01:20:57 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, and Manx the little calico CatBot here.
Emily Ford is sleeping on a white leather sofa.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow. Eli Grey is sitting on a soft square brown floor cushion. Damien Goss is seated. Anfisa of Marzore and Melinda Michaels are dozing on a white leather sofa. Ather Jammoa, Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec, Aisling the Fox, and Nissi Valdaire are sitting on a white leather sofa. Vernos Bailey is sitting on a silky 
01:20:57 indigo cushion. Morris Corlew and Luja Garland are sitting on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

01:21:00 Morris Corlew nods. "He who must not be named."

01:21:12 Morris says to Damien, "That's the impression I got from a family lived near me."

01:21:13 Morris Corlew shrugs.

01:21:20 Damien Goss says, "Hence where the saying, 'Speak of the devil and he shall appear.' comes from."

01:21:23 Damien Goss shrugs.

01:21:24 Morris Corlew nods.

01:21:27 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

01:21:42 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:21:47 Luja Garland exclaims, "Ahhh, I recognize that!"

01:22:40 Damien Goss says, "The oarsman though is different he is the one that ferries souls across and down the river styx in Greek mythology originally, at least as far as I've ever read."

01:22:48 Morris Corlew says, "Anyway, makes me wonder, if what we see in the rift really does come from our shared consciousness, what brought up the Dante's Inferno specifics."

01:23:11 Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:23:16 Luja Garland asks, "Wait, is Dante also the devil?"

01:23:24 Morris Corlew says, "No."

01:23:29 Morris Corlew says, "Dante was an Italian poet."

01:23:30 Damien Goss says, "No Dante was a guy who made a deal with the devil."

01:23:34 Eli Grey says, "It almost has to be based on something with us, too many human things to be anything otherwise."

01:23:35 Damien Goss says, "Or well yeah."

01:23:42 Morris Corlew says, "The poems are about that, yeah."

01:23:43 Damien Goss says, "He wrote about a guy that made the deal."

01:23:45 Morris Corlew nods.

01:23:52 Damien Goss asks, "What the hell was his name?"

01:23:53 Eli Grey says, "Imean.. one of hte riftscapes looks like an acient war from Old Earth."

01:23:55 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:23:57 Eli Grey says, "Er.. ancient."

01:24:56 Morris Corlew asks, "I think he used his own name? It's been...wow, maybe...6 years?"

01:25:07 Damien Goss says, "The Dante story tells of a journey of this guy who I can't remember the name of that makes a deal with the devil then when the devil calls in his marker he goes through the circles of hell."

01:25:28 Eli Grey says, "I think he used his own name, if you are referring ot that old poem."

01:25:31 Morris Corlew nods.

01:25:34 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

01:26:40 Morris Corlew says, "Had to read all of 'em in school. But been so long I don't remember all that much. The scenes have brought way too much back for my likin though."

01:26:45 Damien Goss shrugs.

01:27:20 Luja Garland says, "Sounds like a pretty neat horror movie."

01:27:25 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:27:29 Damien Goss says, "It probably would be."

01:27:41 Morris Corlew says, "Well, served up rift-style..."

01:27:42 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

01:30:03 Damien Goss stands up.

01:30:04 Damien Goss steps south.

01:30:43 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

01:30:45 Damien Goss sits down.

01:33:00 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, someone should definintely make a horror holofilm based on the rift."

01:33:28 Morris Corlew says, "Oh hey. We're speading back up."

01:33:34 Morris Corlew coughs. "Speeding."

01:33:42 Vernos Bailey says, "Well if you got ather to star in it, it would not even need to be about the rift."

01:33:52 Morris Corlew laughs.

01:33:56 Morris Corlew says, "Ather could be the oarsman."

01:34:40 Eli Grey asks, "Speaking of HOrror films, anyone mind if I put on the Siren?"

01:34:51 Morris Corlew shrugs. "Sure."

01:34:52 Vernos Bailey says, "Go for it."

01:34:54 Damien Goss asks, "The siren?"

01:34:58 Eli Grey nods to Damien Goss.

01:34:59 Luja Garland asks, "What's that?"

01:35:10 Eli Grey removes a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies' from a maple coffee table.

01:35:15 Damien Goss shrugs. "Never heard of it, but go ahead."

01:35:22 Eli Grey asks, "Anyone have a problem with sexual themes?"

01:35:27 Eli Grey removes a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" from a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies'.

01:35:28 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

01:35:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I have better movie disc."

01:35:50 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "We don't wanna see your strip tease."

01:35:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec removes a 10-panel film disc titled "Best Of The WMOS, Volume Deux" from a small black leather backpack.

01:36:01 Eli Grey puts a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" in a silver projector.

01:36:04 Eli Grey laughs at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:36:09 Eli Grey asks, "Is that really what I think it is?"

01:36:13 Eli Grey closes a silver projector.

01:36:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Wait."

01:36:24 Eli Grey says, "Haha, a recording of the Moss channel, nice."

01:36:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We must watch moss first."

01:36:30 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec opens a silver projector.

01:36:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec removes a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" from a silver projector.

01:36:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec puts a 10-panel film disc titled "Best Of The WMOS, Volume Deux" in a silver projector.

01:36:40 Luja Garland snickers.

01:36:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec closes a silver projector.

01:36:45 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sets a silver projector upright and turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color show begins.

01:36:47 Eli Grey says, "Ok, it looks like a shorter one, sure."

01:36:48 Morris Corlew chuckles.

01:36:50 [From the projector] The camera shows some archival footage of the Premier Maxime Roberge eating a poutine. Offscreen, you can hear something said in a French Rimward accent, "Allo! These are more best moments of WMOS! Enjoy more the moss! Ha! Ha!"

01:37:02 Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself.

01:37:03 [From the projector] The view pans slowly through a lush forest.

01:37:05 Luja Garland exclaims, "Ohh. It's her!"

01:37:08 Eli Grey smirks.

01:37:08 [From the projector] A fallen tree trunk gradually comes into view as the camera pans.

01:37:14 [From the projector] Once the tree trunk is centered in view, the camera zooms in slowly.

01:37:16 Eli Grey asks, "Ok we have to guess, is it goingto be moss, or not?"

01:37:20 [From the projector] You see a patch of greyish green upon the surface of the tree trunk. The camera continues zooming in.

01:37:26 Eli Grey says, "Could be slime."

01:37:28 [From the projector] It becomes clear that the greyish green patch growing on the tree trunk is indeed moss, perhaps lichen.

01:37:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "It could be lichen."

01:37:32 Eli Grey says, "Nope, it was moss."

01:37:35 [From the projector] The camera zooms in to show the fine details of the mossy growth.

01:37:35 Eli Grey cheers.

01:37:41 [From the projector] After a long, lingering gaze at the moss, the camera zooms out and resumes panning around the forest.

01:37:42 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:37:48 [From the projector] A deep voice intones gravely, "You are watching... The Moss Channel."

01:37:50 Aisling the Fox asks, "Someone recorded moss channel?"

01:37:54 [From the projector] The image fades to black for a moment.

01:37:57 Eli Grey points at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:38:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Yes."

01:38:01 The images above the holographic projector cease as the disc ends.

01:38:01 Morris Corlew chuckles.

01:38:03 Eli Grey says, "Wanted to watch that instead of The Siren."

01:38:05 Eli Grey laughs.

01:38:07 Morris Corlew says, "Leave it to Pierre."

01:38:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Because you cannot watch holovid on journeys."

01:38:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec opens a silver projector.

01:38:15 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "Good stuff."

01:38:16 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec removes a 10-panel film disc titled "Best Of The WMOS, Volume Deux" from a silver projector.

01:38:22 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I forgot where I put first volume."

01:38:30 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec puts a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" in a silver projector.

01:38:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec closes a silver projector.

01:38:36 Eli Grey puts a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies' on a maple coffee table.

01:38:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec puts a 10-panel film disc titled "Best Of The WMOS, Volume Deux" in a small black leather backpack.

01:39:01 Eli Grey grins.

01:39:03 Eli Grey says, "Ok."

01:39:07 Eli Grey sets a silver projector upright and turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color show begins.

01:39:12 [From the projector] Soft, eerie violin music begins to play, and the black screen slowly fills with stars.

01:39:19 [From the projector] Against the backdrop of stars, the words appear: "An Oedipus Entertainment Presentation." The words slowly fade away.

01:39:26 [From the projector] New words in flowing silver script appear against the stars: "The Siren." The violin music briefly swells and fades, and the screen goes black.

01:39:35 [From the projector] The scene opens in the Chetumal spaceport. People are everywhere. You hear tinny synthesized music, an unintelligible announcement over the spaceport's PA system, and the sounds of many voices. A neon sign flashes brightly over a nearby doorway.

01:39:48 [From the projector] The camera focuses on a tall, thin man in the crowd. His lips seem twisted into a permanent sneer. He is wearing a faded black shipsuit with red trim. He has short salt-and-pepper hair, and gray stubble covers his chin.

01:39:52 The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle impotently.

01:40:02 [From the projector] The man shoulders his way through the crowd. He bumps one burly man, who stops as if to challenge him. But the thin man scowls at him, and the other man turns and walks away.

01:40:15 [From the projector] The man makes his way to the spaceport bar, his craggy face briefly but garishly illuminated by the neon sign over the doorway.

01:40:24 [From the projector] The bar is crowded. The man grumbles as he takes the only open seat, which is near a group of young pilots in purple shipsuits. His eyes narrow as he looks them over. "Cadets," he sneers. "IA cadets. Useless."

01:40:25 Morris Corlew says, "The siren and Dante's inferno."

01:40:37 Eli Grey smirks.

01:40:37 [From the projector] The man orders a mug of Chetumalian stout, takes a deep drink, then slams the mug down and wipes his mouth with his sleeve. His challenging stare wanders around the crowded, noisy bar, finally coming again to rest on the young pilots at the next table.

01:40:53 Vernos Bailey says, "We should turn on the bubble for the holovid."

01:40:53 [From the projector] They are laughing. Their shipsuits are new. Their expensive watches glimmer in the low light. "I don't care who he is," one of them declares loudly. "I'll shoot him right out of the sky if he fucks with me!" The others laugh in response.

01:41:06 Morris Corlew says, "Makes it more interesting."

01:41:07 Morris Corlew grins.

01:41:08 [From the projector] The man drinks his stout and leans back in his chair, his legs stretched out before him. As he listens to the cadets, he begins to smile.

01:41:18 [From the projector] The scene switches back to the cadets. One of them is snickering, his hands out as though shaped around a pair of large breasts. "And she was like this!" he says. Suddenly a large mug of stout is slammed down on the table in their midst.

01:41:34 [From the projector] They look up in surprise. The thin man is standing there. "Mind if I join you?" he asks in a voice that demands they say yes. "Sure," one of them says, gesturing vaguely around the table. The others shrug.

01:41:41 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:41:48 [From the projector] The thin man sits down, forcing them to make room. Then he stares at each one in turn, grins, and starts talking.

01:41:57 [From the projector] The night wears on. The cadets sit there quietly. You hear the man's voice, telling tales of a rough life spent on the very outskirts of civilization, of pirates and derelict ships full of dead bodies.

01:42:09 [From the projector] The cadets seem entranced. They lean forward, hanging on his every word, apparently not noticing that his smile is mocking, his eyes full of malice.

01:42:19 [From the projector] The scene changes. It is a lot later. The place is quiet now. The bartender dries glasses at the bar. Only the cadets and the older man are left. The cadets are silent. "There were body parts out there," the man snarls. "But there always are."

01:42:35 [From the projector] The camera closes in on the man's sneering face. "But that's not the worst thing," he says, his eyes narrowing. "No, the worst thing is... the Siren."

01:42:45 [From the projector] The man leans close. The cadets listen helplessly, looking slightly sick. "They say it's only a story, but..." Gradually, the man's voice fades and the scene changes.

01:42:55 [From the projector] You see a dimly lit starship control room. A scruffy man is slouched in the captain's chair. He scratches his leg as he stares out of the viewport into a black expanse of space. Food wrappers and empty gelatin containers are scattered around. His gray shipsuit is dirty, and he hasn't shaved in a while.

01:43:14 [From the projector] The camera pans around the cramped control room. The shadows in the corners are deep. Something moves there, but you can't see what it is.

01:43:23 [From the projector] The man yawns hugely and settles down in the chair as though he means to sleep. He reaches up and scratches the back of his neck. He settles down again. A shadow moves behind him.

01:43:36 [From the projector] Suddenly, he sits up with a yelp and slaps at the back of his neck. He looks at his hand. It appears normal.

01:43:44 There appear to be about 24 pilots recently active.

Additionally, there are 13 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.

01:43:45 [From the projector] With a low curse, he starts to look behind him. Then he cries out, startled, and in one swift motion, jumps out of the chair and whirls around.

01:43:46 There appear to be about 24 pilots recently active.

01:43:46 The starship's computer and QE comm detect:

01:43:55 "Say boo!" Damien Goss pokes Luja Garland in the ribs!

01:43:55 [From the projector] A beautiful woman drifts there behind his chair, her long black hair flowing around her naked body. She is voluptuous, her breasts large and full, her hips womanly. Her smooth skin is oddly translucent, and stars seem to shine from inside her.

01:44:05 Luja Garland exclaims, "Ack!"

01:44:08 Luja Garland exclaims, "I mean boo!"

01:44:10 [From the projector] She watches the man, an unearthly smile on her lush wet lips. Her dark eyes are as black as the void of deep space.

01:44:19 [From the projector] "Wha...!" the man yells, his eyes wide with alarm. "How did you get on my ship! Who the hell ARE you!" He backs away, only to be stopped by the control panel behind him.

01:44:31 [From the projector] The woman smiles and cups her breasts, holding them out to him, her luscious mauve nipples erect, her body swaying seductively.

01:44:39 [From the projector] The camera focuses on the man again. Gradually his expression changes. His face grows slack and his eyes glaze over. He smiles as though drunk.

01:44:49 [From the projector] Now you see the woman from the man's point of view. He is in the chair, and she is straddling him, slowly and sensuously moving up and down. Her dark eyes heavy-lidded and hungry, she smiles down at him.

01:45:01 Morris shifts on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:45:03 [From the projector] Her black hair seems to float in the air, filled with stars. She arches her back, her naked body sinuously moving over him, her breasts swaying heavily. You hear the man's gruff voice. "Yeah, baby, that's right... Oh, yeah..."

01:45:06 Luja Garland exclaims, "Oh no, she's too seductive for anyone's good!"

01:45:15 Eli Grey laughs.

01:45:17 [From the projector] The camera circles the man, closing in on his now naked torso. He is groaning, his hips jerking spasmodically. He is in the throes of orgasm. The view changes slightly to the woman above him.

01:45:29 [From the projector] No one is there! No one at all. The man groans, thrusting upward, his seed spurting into the empty air...

01:45:37 [From the projector] The scene cuts back to the bar on Chetumal. The cadets are staring at each other in horror. They seem even younger now and not nearly so brash. One reaches for his mug and gulps down the last of his lager.

01:45:52 [From the projector] The thin man sneers at them, saying, "She'll make you think you have her, boys. But you won't. Remember that when you're out there alone. She'll get you. Sooner or later, she'll get you."

01:45:58 Damien Goss says, "Sheesh, what an idiot."

01:46:04 [From the projector] You see the man walking away from the bar. He snickers to himself. "Stupid IA," he mutters. "They'll believe anything."

01:46:12 [From the projector] The scene has changed. The man is seated in the control room of his ship. The lights are low. The room is cramped and untidy, with cables tangled across the floor and crates of junk stacked along the walls.

01:46:26 [From the projector] He leans forward, checking the navigation display. The dimly lit screen shows that he is deep in uncharted space. "Stupid fucking cadets," he says. Then he chuckles to himself. "Stupid fucking IA."

01:46:30 Morris scratches his head.

01:46:36 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:46:38 [From the projector] He reaches into a cubbyhole beneath the control panel, pulls out a bottle of dark liquid, uncaps it, and takes a deep swig. Laughing unpleasantly, he holds the bottle to his chest. "Oughta go back. Tell 'em another one."

01:46:43 Eli Grey says, "Oooh."

01:46:44 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

01:46:44 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 4460-2644 about 23.02 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northnortheast and Very Slightly Down.

01:46:45 Vernos Bailey says, "Oort."

01:46:49 You nod.

01:46:50 Vernos Bailey asks, "Should we recharge?"

01:46:51 [From the projector] He snickers. "Hell, fuck 'em. Dumbasses shouldn't be in space..."

01:46:56 [From the projector] The scene changes again. The man is asleep, snoring, the bottle nearly empty. Suddenly, he twitches and comes awake. He looks around, blinking sleepily.

01:47:05 [From the projector] "What?" he mumbles, frowning. He sits up, turns his head, looking back over his shoulder. Suddenly, he leaps to his feet.

01:47:11 Damien Goss says, "Got just over a day's worth of charge."

01:47:14 [From the projector] The woman is there, smiling, naked, her black hair swirling around her.

01:47:20 [From the projector] The man's face fills first with disbelief and then with horror. His mouth opens. He screams. The woman laughs softly. The scene fades to black.

01:47:29 [From the projector] A long time has passed. The power in the ship's batteries is waning. The lights are low. An empty bottle of liquor lies on the floor. There is the captain's chair before the flickering control panel.

01:47:42 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

01:47:42 [From the projector] A man sprawls in the chair, his pants down around his ankles, nearly covering his scuffed boots. Only a few scraps of rotting flesh are left over his bones. But in the gruesome remains of his face, he appears to be smiling.

01:47:45 Luja Garland switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

01:47:49 Morris Corlew says, "Dang. She got him."

01:47:57 [From the projector] The lights get weaker as the ship's power is finally drained completely. The screen goes black.

01:47:57 Luja Garland switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

01:48:03 [From the projector] Stars gradually appear in the darkness. You see the ship, tiny against the starry expanse of space. Then that, too, fades to black.

01:48:08 Damien Goss nods. "Yup, idiot."

01:48:12 [From the projector] The credits roll quickly by, a surprisingly short list.

01:48:12 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.

01:48:15 Luja Garland switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

01:48:17 [From the projector] THE END

01:48:19 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Oort probably too boring."

01:48:22 Morris Corlew applauds sedately.

01:48:24 The images above the holographic projector cease as the disc ends.

01:48:38 Damien Goss says, "Pretty good movie though."

01:48:41 Vernos Bailey says, "Was thinking to recharge if nissi wanted."

01:48:46 Vernos Bailey says, "Not to sight see."

01:49:09 Damien Goss says, "If we stop there charging is going to take at least a couple hours I'm sure."

01:49:11 Morris Corlew says, "Can recharge anywhere."

01:50:18 The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight with each other.

01:51:34 Eli Grey grins.

01:51:36 Eli Grey opens a silver projector.

01:51:39 Eli Grey removes a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" from a silver projector.

01:51:44 Eli Grey removes a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies' from a maple coffee table.

01:51:48 Morris says to Eli, "Who's the filmmaker on that?"

01:51:49 Eli Grey puts a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" in a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies'.

01:51:58 Eli Grey says, "Oh jeez.. um."

01:52:07 Eli Grey removes a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" from a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies'.

01:52:11 Ather says to Eli, "Do you have God of the Woods?"

01:52:15 Eli Grey says, "I dn't remember."

01:52:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Is Anika Shonak."

01:52:15 Nissi Valdaire says, "Stop panicking about recharging, seriously. We got over a day."

01:52:26 Morris Corlew nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:52:29 Eli Grey says, "Oh yeah that was her name Anika."

01:52:30 Damien Goss nods.

01:52:44 Morris Corlew says, "That's really well done."

01:52:51 Damien says to Nissi, "Do you still want to skip common stuff in favor of farther distance?"

01:52:53 Eli says to Ather, "No I don't think it's in here, these are from the ships's library anyways."

01:52:58 Eli Grey puts a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies' on a maple coffee table.

01:53:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Still got fair chance to find something worth sending extended observation probe to while charging."

01:53:04 Nissi Valdaire nods to Damien Goss.

01:53:06 Damien Goss nods.

01:53:14 Ather Jammoa says, "Aww."

01:53:19 Ather Jammoa says, "God of the Woods was the best ever."

01:53:23 Ather Jammoa says, "I still have a copy of it."

01:53:28 Morris Corlew says, "I wanna see the Hourse movie again."

01:53:29 Morris Corlew grins.

01:53:32 Eli Grey says, "I think you showed me once heh."

01:53:36 Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.

01:53:37 Nissi Valdaire removes a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies' from a maple coffee table.

01:53:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I watched hourse movie once."

01:53:44 Eli Grey says, "There's no coming Home in there either, that's a good one."

01:53:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Very inspiring."

01:53:58 Eli Grey grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

01:54:00 Nissi Valdaire says, "This movies collection is not very complete."

01:54:03 Nissi Valdaire puts a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies' on a maple coffee table.

01:54:09 Melinda Michaels asks, "Movies?"

01:54:10 Ather Jammoa removes a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies' from a maple coffee table.

01:54:15 Morris Corlew says, "Mooooovies."

01:54:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Wo."

01:54:26 Ather Jammoa puts a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies' on a maple coffee table.

01:54:30 Ather Jammoa says, "It really is not very complete."

01:54:32 Eli says to Nissi, "Just glad you had The Siren, my copy seemingly vanished, and I don't think you can buy it anymore."

01:54:39 Melinda says to Nissi, "I think Annie kept some of yours."

01:54:42 Melinda Michaels shrugs.

01:54:53 Ather Jammoa says, "I bought Anika's library at that one book fair thing."

01:55:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "All movies of the Anika are lost like tears in the rift."

01:55:10 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "They rae not."

01:55:16 Ather Jammoa says, "We old folks still have them."

01:55:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well."

01:55:37 Damien Goss says, "The only movie I've ever seen in that store was you never know."

01:55:53 Ather Jammoa says, "That movie was kinda weird, and I don't know why I wasted the credits buying it."

01:56:11 Eli Grey asks, "You'll never know? That's the one about civilian pilots right?"

01:56:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Expansion is pretty good though."

01:56:19 Ather Jammoa says, "I enjoyed it."

01:56:27 Melinda Michaels says, "I don't own any movies."

01:56:34 Vernos Bailey says, "Me either."

01:56:41 Eli Grey says, "Hmm haven't seen Expansion."

01:56:45 Damien Goss says, "Yeah it was like here have a bunch of short stories with no endings."

01:56:50 Ather Jammoa says, "It'll make you chuckle."

01:56:54 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/SC.

01:57:01 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:57:02 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

01:57:04 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:57:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We can watch the moss again."

01:57:17 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

01:57:21 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "I will shoot you."

01:59:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I heard good things about first volume of WMOS."

01:59:42 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:01:11 The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight with each other.

02:01:40 Vernos Bailey slumps in a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars and goes to sleep.

02:06:49 Luja Garland yawns.

02:06:52 Luja Garland says, "Sleep time."

02:06:54 Luja Garland stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:06:58 Melinda Michaels waves to Luja Garland.

02:06:58 Morris Corlew nods to Luja Garland.

02:07:00 Morris Corlew waves.

02:07:01 Damien Goss waves to Luja Garland.

02:07:02 Morris says to Luja, "Rest well."

02:07:03 I don't see that here.

02:07:06 Luja Garland says, "Sleep good when you do."

02:07:06 You wave to Luja Garland.

02:07:11 Luja Garland waves.

02:07:12 Luja Garland steps south.

02:10:41 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

02:11:30 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

02:12:00 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/SC.

02:12:23 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

02:12:32 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

02:12:42 Aisling the Fox says, "Much nicer."

02:17:46 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/SC.

02:17:56 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:18:27 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

02:18:34 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/SC.

02:18:35 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

02:21:41 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:21:51 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

02:23:42 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

02:24:05 Eli Grey navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:24:22 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Leave us, Opik, you are too boring."

02:24:36 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:27:42 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:32:21 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tail.

02:37:04 Morris Corlew strokes a Tardick lizard named Freyja's warm scaly skin.

02:37:20 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly south.

02:37:42 "Guess she wasn't into the pets." Morris Corlew shrugs.

02:38:50 A black digital felo game emits a sprightly beep as the felo wakes up.

02:42:24 A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the distance.

02:42:45 Morris waves to the birds.

02:44:48 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:45:13 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

02:45:13 A black digital felo game beeps hungrily as the felo rapidly empties its food bowl.

02:45:17 A black digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

02:45:23 Aisling the Fox strokes a black digital felo game lovingly.

02:45:53 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:45:55 Morris Corlew examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

02:46:00 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Morris Corlew removes a small round personal pepperoni pizza from the open compartment.

02:46:03 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small round personal pepperoni pizza.

02:47:56 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:47:57 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:51:42 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:52:34 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

02:52:36 A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.

02:52:40 Morris Corlew waves to Rogue Romano.

02:52:46 You wave to Rogue Romano.

02:52:47 Rogue Romano waves.

02:53:38 Rogue Romano slinks east.

02:54:34 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

02:54:46 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small round personal pepperoni pizza.

02:55:14 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

02:55:19 Rogue Romano carefully unwraps a meatball sandwich.

02:55:23 Rogue Romano picks up half of a meatball sandwich and takes a huge bite.

02:55:42 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:55:49 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small round personal pepperoni pizza.

02:56:02 Damien Goss stands up.

02:56:06 Damien Goss says, "I'm going to go lay down."

02:56:08 Damien Goss waves.

02:56:11 Damien Goss steps south.

02:56:16 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Rest well."

02:56:24 Rogue Romano says into the PA microphone, "Rest well Goss."

02:56:34 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks."

02:57:51 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

02:57:52 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morris your delicate toes will be ok now."

02:57:58 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

02:58:04 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Woo."

03:00:40 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

03:00:48 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:00:52 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:00:58 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:01:02 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:01:09 Morris says to Lily Kaise, "Thanks."

03:01:20 Lily Kaise says, "You are welcome."

03:01:49 Lily Kaise says, "I did leave a small aquarium which has Maxwells but it doesn't take up much room."

03:01:56 Morris Corlew nods. "That's fine."

03:02:10 Morris Corlew says, "Just squishing between the wall aquariums plus that thing and the chow...was pretty tight."

03:02:42 The grassy outcrop flies close to a snow-capped mountain range. Gentle flurries swirl around momentarily before the chunk veers away to warmer air.

03:07:51 Lily Kaise tickles you!

03:07:54 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:07:59 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:08:23 Lily Kaise whispers, "I love you almost as much as I love the stars."

03:08:51 Rogue Romano takes another large bite of a meatball sandwich.

03:08:53 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:08:53 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tail.

03:09:02 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:09:04 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:09:31 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:09:44 Rogue Romano finishes off half of a meatball sandwich.

03:09:49 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah shule is only second to my love of the stars."

03:09:57 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:10:06 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:10:08 Morris says to Lily, "Wrap your arms around the stars. Embrace them. Oh...bye bye Lily."

03:10:09 Morris Corlew grins.

03:10:21 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah seriously that would be hot stuff right there!"

03:10:24 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:10:25 Morris Corlew chuckles. "Yep."

03:10:26 You laugh.

03:13:13 A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.

03:13:23 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly south.

03:13:50 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

03:14:00 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

03:14:04 Morris Corlew frowns.

03:14:29 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

03:14:37 Rogue Romano starts in on the second half of a meatball sandwich.

03:15:22 Morris Corlew finishes off a small round personal pepperoni pizza.

03:17:42 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

03:17:53 Morris Corlew examines a fresh fruit juice dispenser for a moment.

03:17:56 Morris Corlew helps himself to a cup of sweet pale yellow pear juice.

03:17:57 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of sweet pale yellow pear juice.

03:20:13 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:20:14 Lily Kaise glides east.

03:20:43 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

03:20:46 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:23:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Go away, Opik."

03:23:37 Morris Corlew grins.

03:26:59 Vernos Bailey suddenly awakens.

03:27:01 Rogue Romano takes another large bite of a meatball sandwich.

03:27:33 Rogue Romano finishes off the last of a meatball sandwich.

03:27:39 Rogue Romano crumples up her stained crinkled sandwich wrapper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

03:27:42 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

03:27:53 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

03:29:21 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:29:27 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:33:42 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:39:42 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:39:43 Lily Kaise carefully unwraps a Cuban sandwich.

03:39:48 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of sweet pale yellow pear juice.

03:42:27 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:42:33 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.

03:42:59 Lily says to you, "You're not as hot as those stars but Baby you look good!"

03:43:03 Lily Kaise grins.

03:43:08 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:43:13 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:43:19 Lily says to you, "You are so fresh, so fine!"

03:43:22 Lily Kaise giggles.

03:43:26 Morris Corlew says, "Finally got out of range of that poor lonely oort."

03:43:28 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:43:33 Lily Kaise chuckles at you.

03:43:51 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

03:48:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I will never forget Opik."

03:48:40 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I so will!"

03:48:41 Morris Corlew says, "Poor Opik."

03:48:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:48:59 You chuckle.

03:49:08 Morris Corlew says, "So lonely out here, all alone. No images for anyone to remember it by, no studies done, no human visit- Oh wait. Never mind."

03:49:09 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:49:18 Lily Kaise says, "The only one I would like to find is where a certain ship of mine still seems to reside even though I likely won't even see it in there since it's dead."

03:49:26 Morris Corlew looks at Lily Kaise thoughtfully.

03:49:31 Morris says to Lily, "Where is this?"

03:49:41 Lily Kaise exclaims, "It's on the board!"

03:49:47 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

03:49:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Is over there."

03:49:56 Morris says to Lily, "There's tons of messages on that board..."

03:50:16 Lily Kaise says, "I think it's around 36 or somewhere in that vacinity."

03:50:25 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

03:51:01 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

03:51:06 Morris says to Lily, "Mind if I ask what happened?"

03:51:43 Lily Kaise says, "It was before we could get much meaningful info from the NDB or at least before I could so I got... lost out there. Now, I know I would find my way back."

03:51:59 Morris Corlew nods.

03:52:04 Morris Corlew asks, "You didn't blow it?"

03:52:34 Lily Kaise says, "I should have just self-destructed it but I wastrying to save my two pets. They perished anyway when I transferred to the escape pod due to the delay."

03:52:52 Morris Corlew says, "Awww. Sorry."

03:52:58 Morris Corlew says, "Spacesuits."

03:53:07 Morris Corlew removes a tiny sky blue spacesuit helmet from a forest green backpack.

03:53:10 Morris Corlew hugs a tiny sky blue spacesuit helmet.

03:53:15 Morris Corlew says, "Miss my Sky."

03:53:16 Morris Corlew sighs.

03:53:18 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah this was before spacesuits for pet felo or ewll seems those were introduced while I was out there."

03:53:20 Morris Corlew puts a tiny sky blue spacesuit helmet in a forest green backpack.

03:53:23 Morris Corlew nods.

03:53:55 Morris Corlew pats Lily Kaise on the back.

03:53:58 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

03:53:58 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah we have three that we liley won't see again because they were old but glad we had them while we could."

03:54:09 Morris Corlew nods.

03:54:13 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:54:15 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:54:19 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:54:57 Lily Kaise says, "Wouldn't have missed this trip though and I'm sure they are getting lots of pets from Eve."

03:54:58 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

03:55:05 Morris Corlew nods.

03:55:17 You nod.

03:57:18 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

03:57:23 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of sweet pale yellow pear juice.

03:57:47 Lily Kaise says, "So nowadays, yeah if you manage to become too lost, put spacesuits on your pets and self-destruct the thing. I have never felt comfortable with leving tech out there."

03:57:59 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:58:09 "Yeah." Morris Corlew nods. "Not something I ever wanna do. Never know who could come across it."

03:58:18 Lily Kaise says, "Right."

03:58:26 Lily Kaise says, "Ironically, I still have keys."

03:58:30 Lily Kaise says, "And the title."

03:59:04 "It's still viable." Morris Corlew nods. "Starseekers still owns the gem Angel left floating at the Bubble. Not that we'll ever see it again, but we do still own it."

03:59:12 You nod.

03:59:19 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

03:59:42 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:00:51 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well, I would always recommend self-destructing because you can save everything but the ship so it's best and keeps the tech away from those who shouldn't have access to it."

04:00:59 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

04:01:38 Lily Kaise says, "Crazy too because all it would require is a charge booster to get it to 287."

04:01:44 Morris Corlew says, "She was told the burst of energy from the escape mechanism might make it visible on long-range scans and therefore able to be found. I was very new at the time or would have said something about it."

04:01:52 Morris Corlew nods. "There were none aboard apparently."

04:02:04 Morris Corlew says, "I honestly didn't know that wouldn't work."

04:02:13 Lily Kaise says, "Well I don't leave home without them or I can craft them."

04:02:35 Morris Corlew says, "Crafting them is all well and good, but they have to be charged to use 'em."

04:02:44 You nod. "Exactly."

04:03:10 Lily Kaise says, "True but if I knew I was getting into trouble there would likely be enough charge for me to charge them."

04:03:22 Morris Corlew says, "I need to double check, but...I meant to put a couple boosters and a temp drive on all our ships that could use them but don't recall if I ever got around to doing it."

04:03:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Even if such a thing would make ship visible, it would be some extremely short time."

04:03:33 Morris Corlew says, "Charging them takes charge."

04:03:39 Morris Corlew nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:03:48 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "Someone...the one who told her to do that, was in the area."

04:04:23 Morris Corlew says, "I don't know how much charge it takes, but I'd imagine it'd take as much charge as they give you. Which means it's kinda pointless."

04:04:23 Lily Kaise says, "Well weird she didn't do much but oh well. Maybe someday someone will happen on it."

04:04:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "If you scream loudly enough in unpowered ship, sonic wave will spread through vaccuum and make ship visible."

04:04:30 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:04:31 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

04:04:34 Morris Corlew grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:04:56 Lily says to Pierre-Louis, "Maybe farting would be more... effective?"

04:05:00 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:05:15 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

04:05:26 Morris Corlew smirks.

04:05:29 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

04:05:37 Lily Kaise finishes off the last of a Cuban sandwich.

04:06:18 Lily Kaise puts down a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

04:06:20 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:06:54 I don't understand that.

04:06:56 I don't understand that.

04:06:59 You are carrying a goblet in your right hand.

04:07:03 I see no "trash" here.

04:07:18 You peer east...

04:07:18 
[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Galley]
A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see the galley vending machine, a stainless steel table, a stainless steel bench, a polished red cedar bar, a shiny black deluxe ramen cooker with a golden dragon on top, a shiny black deluxe rice cooker with a golden dragon on top, a red industrial-strength kitchen blender, a sleek stainless steel beverage machine with purple accents, a large red popcorn popper with chrome accents, a large silver vending machine, a robotic chef named Nellie, a compact white refrigerator, and a bulky green flavored cola dispenser here.
You can go west.

04:15:03 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

04:15:07 Morris Corlew frowns.

04:15:13 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

04:15:32 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I don't like that burnt scenery or the war one."

04:15:45 Lily Kaise says, "Very sad."

04:15:46 Morris Corlew nods. "Or Dante's Inferno...and then we have...the..."

04:15:48 You nod.

04:15:51 Morris Corlew shudders. "Ants."

04:16:43 Rogue Romano says, "Creepy crawly ants.."

04:16:54 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the south.

04:16:55 Cheri Lindbergh waves.

04:17:01 Morris Corlew waves to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:17:02 Lily Kaise waves and smiles at Cheri Lindbergh.

04:17:04 Cheri Lindbergh sits down on a white leather sofa.

04:17:14 You wave to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:17:14 Rogue Romano waves to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:17:30 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

04:17:42 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:18:08 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cafe Pepe Sangria.

04:19:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Allo Cheri."

04:20:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We saw a nebular signature and an oort-opik in last two cycles. Did not stop at either."

04:21:04 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We're on a mission!"

04:21:07 Lily Kaise grins.

04:21:34 You grin.

04:21:35 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:21:36 Lily Kaise glides south.

04:21:51 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

04:21:54 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:21:59 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:22:02 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:22:27 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow guess our good flow time is no longer for the time-being!"

04:22:33 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I'm find with not stopping."

04:22:49 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Fine, I mean."

04:23:19 Cheri Lindbergh says, "You've seen one oort cloud, you've seen them all."

04:23:20 Lily Kaise nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:23:34 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I'm here for the good stuff!"

04:23:37 Lily Kaise grins.

04:23:43 Cheri Lindbergh nods to Lily Kaise.

04:23:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Each opik is unique."

04:23:59 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "How far have we come so far?"

04:24:01 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:24:06 Lily Kaise says, "Can find oorts and cluster whatevers all around in comms."

04:24:14 Lily Kaise grins.

04:24:16 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Must be at least 130 LTC by now."

04:24:22 Morris Corlew asks, "Uhm...something like 145 maybe?"

04:24:28 Morris Corlew says, "Hang on."

04:24:32 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:25:13 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

04:25:21 Cheri Lindbergh glances down at her wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

04:25:22 Morris Corlew says, "Ehh. 137-ish."

04:28:37 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I would like apparent region to change to something else, that would be surprise."

04:28:49 Morris Corlew says, "Anything bout Outsider."

04:29:14 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Maybe not that."

04:29:32 Morris Corlew asks, "Maybe???"

04:30:04 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, we would know that they extend quite downward then."

04:30:41 Cheri Lindbergh says, "It's possible that humans live out here."

04:31:34 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:31:43 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I mean they live way the hell out in Feng Wo space, they could sure live here."

04:31:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Our diplomatic contact with the downwarders will be most grand."

04:31:57 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:31:59 Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:32:01 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:32:05 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Downwarders."

04:32:12 Lily Kaise says, "Hope so."

04:32:14 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:32:15 Lily Kaise smiles.

04:32:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The spinward clans are epitome of people going way too far."

04:32:44 Morris Corlew nods. "Quite true."

04:33:16 Lily Kaise says, "Well I won't say what I really think but yeah."

04:33:28 Morris Corlew looks at Lily Kaise thoughtfully.

04:33:35 Cheri Lindbergh says, "The worst part of going out really really far is that you don't have support so much from others, not at first for sure."

04:33:42 Lily Kaise grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

04:33:44 Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:34:14 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I mean it helps you live."

04:34:19 Lily Kaise nods.

04:34:28 Lily Kaise says, "Have to try to get along."

04:34:37 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

04:34:44 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "At least we can send QE message asking for delivery of charge booster satchet."

04:34:51 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:34:59 Lily Kaise chuckles at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:35:08 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:35:23 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:35:32 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Please send one sachet way over here, and please hurry."

04:35:39 Lily Kaise grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

04:36:00 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah like book it maaaaayin."

04:36:01 Morris Corlew asks, "Ain't sachets them things ya stick in a drawer to make your clothes smell all frilly?"

04:36:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:36:07 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We have five mincycles of power left. It might be tight."

04:36:09 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:36:14 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:36:22 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm oh yeah that."

04:36:23 Cheri Lindbergh says, "But don't worry, everybody has a spacesuit."

04:36:26 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:36:29 Lily Kaise glides south.

04:36:49 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heh 20 percent is bountiful."

04:36:55 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

04:37:01 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:37:04 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Maybe we will meet some space flaura leeches that sucks power directly out of battery."

04:37:09 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:37:17 Morris says to Lily, "How many cycles?"

04:37:26 Lily Kaise says, "I am not worrid with 20 percent of charge. Not at all."

04:37:32 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "You're just strange."

04:37:33 Morris Corlew grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:37:43 Morris says to Lily, "That's not why I asked, but ok."

04:37:44 Morris Corlew grins.

04:37:49 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

04:37:54 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:37:55 Morris Corlew lopes south.

04:38:02 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

04:38:03 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:38:06 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I have a lot of faith in these fancy ships."

04:38:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Either way, I hope we get to somewhere worthy of extended observatory probe before we run out of the juice."

04:38:25 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

04:38:27 Lily Kaise says, "We have enough in the hold to give us a decent boost if we never see an object or area with debris."

04:39:01 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:41:43 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

04:41:58 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

04:42:29 Cheri Lindbergh says, "When I woke up I saw a volcano, and I gotta say I'm glad I don't live on a planet."

04:42:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:42:43 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cafe Pepe Sangria.

04:42:48 Morris Corlew nods. "I never lived where volcanoes were, but...yeah, I gotta agree with ya there."

04:43:01 Lily Kaise gives a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:43:05 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Planets can kill you."

04:43:08 Cheri Lindbergh says, "In many ways."

04:43:14 Morris Corlew says, "So can space."

04:43:28 Lily Kaise says, "So can space stations if you don't vacate before outsiders destroy them."

04:43:33 Lily Kaise grins.

04:43:41 Morris Corlew says, "Or ships, or whatever."

04:43:49 Lily Kaise says, "Well I shouldn't smile it would be extremely sad."

04:44:03 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

04:44:06 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yeah but it's kinda limited in how you can die."

04:44:20 Lily Kaise says, "Well you aren't likely to die on a planet."

04:44:26 Morris Corlew says, "Explosion, loss of air, chemical leak, starvation, debydration, murder..."

04:44:26 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Like on a planet a bug can bite you, a tree can fall on you."

04:44:28 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

04:44:44 Lily Kaise says, "You may loose your home and buildings and infrastructure but you will likely survive."

04:45:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The universe is out to kill all."

04:45:16 Cheri says to Lily, "What if the ground just opens up underneath you?"

04:45:26 Morris Corlew says, "The universe in general is a powerful thing."

04:45:29 Morris Corlew says, "Way bigger than us."

04:45:36 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh I fall in!"

04:45:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:45:45 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Or yeah I might die too!"

04:45:47 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Correction, the universe actually doesn't give a fuck about you."

04:45:56 Lily Kaise says, "Itprobably doesn't."

04:46:05 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

04:46:09 Cheri Lindbergh says, "It's up to you to give a fuck."

04:46:14 Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:46:53 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I extended my eat to the universe, it said fuck."

04:47:01 Lily Kaise says, "Well I look it this way. What happens, happens and I have already enjoyed an immensely awesome life as a child, a young adult and as a pilot so yes stuff happens."

04:47:02 Cheri says to Pierre-Louis, "Your eat?"

04:47:08 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Ear."

04:47:12 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:47:13 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

04:47:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:47:34 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yeah, I'm kinda liking it most of the time."

04:48:00 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:49:42 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

04:50:08 Vernos says to Lily, "How much for a aquarium?"

04:50:31 Vernos Bailey says, "I think I want one for when we finally get back."

04:51:16 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I got eggs but I never made them hatch."

04:51:29 Morris Corlew says, "Fried egg sammich."

04:52:11 Morris says to Lily, "Oh, you know you left two eggs out, not just the one on the stump but one on the table too?"

04:52:12 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

04:53:42 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:55:43 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:57:36 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

04:57:46 Morris Corlew glances down at his mirror finish chrome wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

04:57:48 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:57:54 Lily Kaise says, "Yup I guess I did so those are there for anyone who wants."

04:57:58 Lily Kaise grins.

04:58:04 Morris Corlew says, "I think I might go on to bed."

04:58:10 Morris Corlew finishes off a cup of sweet pale yellow pear juice.

04:58:14 Morris Corlew gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:58:16 Morris Corlew pats Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lightly.

04:58:18 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:58:21 Vernos Bailey says, "Rest well Morris."

04:58:24 Morris Corlew says, "Rest well when ya do folks."

04:58:24 Rogue Romano says, "Rest well Morris."

04:58:31 Lily Kaise waves to Morris Corlew.

04:58:32 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

04:58:32 You wave to Morris Corlew.

04:58:35 Morris Corlew waves. "Thanks."

04:58:36 Morris Corlew lopes south.

04:58:41 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:59:12 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That's so much better Lily. I actually don't have to hold my breath when I walk through."

04:59:13 Vernos says to Lily, "I'd take the eggs but no aquarium."

04:59:14 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he chuckles.

05:00:11 Rogue says to Vernos, "I can make ya one later."

05:00:36 Vernos Bailey says, "Okay."

05:00:42 Rogue Romano grins.

05:00:44 Vernos Bailey says, "That works for mre."

05:00:50 Rogue Romano nods.

05:00:50 Vernos Bailey says, "Me."

05:00:52 Vernos Bailey coughs.

05:01:12 Lily Kaise says, "Oh i'll make one for you."

05:01:19 Lily Kaise removes Lily Kaise's workbench from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

05:01:22 Lily Kaise puts down Lily Kaise's workbench.

05:01:54 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm let's see."

05:02:45 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

05:03:38 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:03:41 Lily Kaise picks up Lily Kaise's workbench.

05:03:42 Lily Kaise glides south.

05:03:55 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

05:04:26 A Tardick lizard named Raissa's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:04:59 You stretch.

05:05:12 Shule stifles a yawn.

05:05:23 Cheri says to you, "Me too."

05:05:28 You grin at Cheri Lindbergh.

05:05:43 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

05:06:20 I see no "lily" here.

05:06:26 You say, "Good night all."

05:07:21 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Night."

05:13:01 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

05:17:16 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

05:17:26 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

05:30:58 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alright lily and thanks for doing so."

05:34:42 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

06:38:12 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:38:48 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "In engineering."

06:38:55 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Who is goin' out with me?"

06:46:43 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

06:46:50 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

06:47:00 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:47:00 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:47:10 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

06:47:35 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Last time I looked we had gone 32 LTC."

06:48:20 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

06:48:34 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

06:48:40 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes off of her feet.

06:48:49 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

06:48:56 You grin at Lily Kaise.

06:48:58 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

06:48:59 You kiss Lily Kaise.

06:49:27 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins stirs and slowly unfolds his eight hairy legs.

06:49:32 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

06:49:57 Lily Kaise kisses you.

06:49:57 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters east.

06:50:07 Lily Kaise says, "Oh we had higgins in here too."

06:50:10 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:50:20 Lily Kaise kisses you.

06:50:37 You say, "We do. Well, did."

06:50:48 Lily says to you, "Ok Love, I don't want to keep you awake. I'll probably fall asleep here shortly."

06:51:03 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Ok. Good night my love.Rest well and sweet dreams."

06:52:06 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

06:53:50 "Nite Love." Lily Kaise smiles at you. "I love you and I am so happy when I wake up beside you."

06:54:16 Lily Kaise says, "Ifeel so secure with you here."

06:54:22 Lily Kaise kisses you.

06:54:29 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

06:54:35 You kiss Lily Kaise.

06:54:46 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I love waking up beside you too."

06:55:10 Lily Kaise beams at you.

06:55:15 Lily Kaise says, "Nite."

06:55:19 You say, "Night."

06:55:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:06:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

07:06:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

07:17:01 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

07:22:55 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

07:33:15 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

07:43:48 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

07:48:13 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

07:48:23 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

07:48:29 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

08:02:01 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You do the same Vern."

08:02:02 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Erm."

08:02:09 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You too Vernos."

08:08:54 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

08:19:21 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

08:26:50 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

08:37:34 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

08:43:34 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

08:48:53 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

08:49:03 Listen. You need to be careful.

08:59:54 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

09:16:18 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

09:26:49 Don't let them trick you.

09:40:54 This is it. It's time to move.

09:41:27 Easy, now.

09:41:56 This is it. It's time to move.

09:42:09 Easy, now.

09:43:46 You're not imagining it. This is real.

09:44:00 Here we go. Hang on to something.

09:44:00 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

09:44:01 Ah, back to normal.

09:44:03 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

09:44:04 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

09:45:00 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

09:49:41 Remember what I said.

09:49:51 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

09:53:10 The pathway tilts downwards abruptly, and you accelerate wildly.

09:53:11 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

10:44:37 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Planets!"

10:45:04 The rainbow pathway curves a wide path around a cloud, banking slightly.

10:45:05 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

10:45:08 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Planets!"

10:45:16 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Plaaaaaaanets!!!!!!"

10:45:28 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rat, Rogue, do you want to do the approach?"

10:45:33 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Na."

10:45:54 The rainbow pathway curves a wide path around a cloud, banking slightly.

10:46:45 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey everyone, I found some planets."

10:46:51 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yea."

10:47:12 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "They were mine first!"

10:47:26 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Maybe this will be a probeworthy system."

10:47:43 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That'd be nice."

10:47:56 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah. I want to see how they work."

10:50:09 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

10:50:19 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

10:57:09 The outcropping veers suddenly.

10:57:10 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

10:58:10 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

11:00:09 A gust of wind catches the island, sending it off in a new direction.

11:04:51 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

11:05:03 The outcropping veers suddenly.

11:05:03 The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A pair of stars orbit together here around their combined center of mass. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Planets in binary systems are generally not large and are in unstable orbits, but a few small rocky planets may exist.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

11:05:12 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wheeeee."

11:05:19 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Binary."

11:05:25 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh cool."

11:05:59 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Slightly greater than sol."

11:06:03 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nice."

11:06:31 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gonna probe these?"

11:13:01 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So with the drain rate what it is, we've got about a day of charge. That'll go down once we start movin again, but it's 14% currently."

11:28:47 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It still surveyin?"

11:28:51 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup."

11:29:11 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alright. I might have to read about it then. Think I'm gonna go try to sleep again."

11:29:29 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nissi, we are around 14% charge. About when do you want to charge and I'll put it in the notes so people will stop asking."

11:44:39 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "4 planets."

11:51:44 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

11:53:05 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:53:11 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:53:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:53:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:11:52 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wheeee."

12:13:03 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

12:13:13 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

12:13:13 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

12:13:18 The starship has left a unique area of space.

12:13:23 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

12:43:14 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

12:53:43 Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.

13:04:22 A gentle breeze gentle rustles through the grass, causing ripple-like waves.

13:12:16 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

13:14:46 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

13:14:56 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

13:44:46 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

13:55:09 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

13:57:44 Lily Kaise glances at her metallic gold touch einrophone and checks her voicemail.

13:57:56 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

14:04:31 Lily Kaise switches a metallic gold touch einrophone off.

14:05:24 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

14:10:45 Lily Kaise picks up a frosted mug of Feng Wo bubbly rice beer.

14:10:51 Lily Kaise opens a compact red refrigerator for a moment.

14:10:51 Lily Kaise puts a frosted mug of Feng Wo bubbly rice beer in a compact red refrigerator.

14:12:14 Lily Kaise removes a large mesh gym bag.

14:12:21 Lily Kaise puts a large mesh gym bag on a long plasteel counter.

14:15:42 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

14:17:14 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

14:17:24 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

14:17:29 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

14:56:33 You kiss Lily Kaise.

14:56:36 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

14:56:41 You smile at Lily Kaise.

14:57:24 A hovercar spends several minutes overtaking you. Smooth, cycloptic faces peer out its windows at you.

14:57:36 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Stay in that car!"

14:57:45 You exclaim, "Yeah, no kidding!"

14:58:17 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

14:58:21 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

14:59:54 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

15:00:04 Lily gently rubs your back.

15:01:02 Shule runs his fingers through your hair.

15:01:05 Lily Kaise says, "So sure wondering when we're going to charge this ship. I bet we have less than 10 percent of charge."

15:01:30 You say, "Yeah, apparently Nissi isn't too worried about it."

15:01:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

15:01:43 You laugh.

15:02:17 Lily Kaise says, "Well not sure I would worry but it will require a lot of work to charge it to full all in one session."

15:02:29 You say, "Yeah, I would think so."

15:05:14 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

15:05:23 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

15:06:55 You smile at Lily Kaise.

15:07:01 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

15:07:42 A single snowglobe zips up to the hovertrailer and circles you once before continuing on.

15:07:46 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

15:07:52 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

15:08:03 Lily Kaise says, "Get on down the road snowglobe."

15:08:09 You nod.

15:09:32 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the neck.

15:09:42 Lily Kaise kisses you softly on the neck.

15:09:43 You say to Lily, "I love you."

15:10:59 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

15:11:04 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

15:11:06 Lily Kaise glides east.

15:12:31 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

15:12:36 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

15:13:07 You peer east...

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Aft]
This room leads to the living quarters, and contains some additional amenities, notably a tiny alcove containing a shower. A small keypad controls access to the living quarters. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a small bubbling neon blue-lit toroidal aquarium containing blue and red aquatic life and round rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, and a Tardick lizard named Freyja here.
You can go north, east, and west.

15:13:22 You peer into the shower...

15:13:22 
[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Shower]
This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You can go out.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

15:18:26 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wheeee. Snowglobes."

15:18:32 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

15:18:40 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

15:18:50 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ahhh man."

15:18:50 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

15:51:09 Emily Ford suddenly awakens.

15:52:04 Emily yawns tiredly.

15:52:08 You say to Emily, "Hi."

15:52:32 Emily Ford says, "Hi there."

15:53:08 Emily Ford navigates her metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

15:53:48 Emily Ford switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

15:53:50 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

15:53:52 Emily Ford navigates her metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

15:54:23 Emily Ford switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

15:56:45 A Tardick lizard named Zeus blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

15:57:15 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly south.

15:57:46 Emily Ford asks, "Anything exciting going on?"

16:00:42 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

16:01:11 Emily Ford gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

16:01:12 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

16:01:19 Emily Ford says, "I guess not."

16:05:14 Emily Ford stands up from a white leather sofa.

16:05:15 Emily Ford slinks south.

16:07:50 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

16:07:59 Jason Rat jogs south.

16:08:27 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

16:08:27 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

16:09:27 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

16:10:07 Emily Ford slinks in from the south.

16:10:33 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

16:10:36 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

16:10:36 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

16:11:14 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Emily?"

16:11:19 Emily Ford says into the PA microphone, "That's me."

16:11:28 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Where'd you go?"

16:11:36 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

16:11:39 Emily Ford says into the PA microphone, "I left the control room as it's apparently cramped in there."

16:11:59 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

16:11:59 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

16:12:03 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:12:03 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ah."

16:12:30 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

16:12:54 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

16:13:51 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

16:14:52 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

16:15:02 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

16:15:22 Emily Ford slinks south.

16:15:51 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

16:16:01 Emily Ford slinks in from the south.

16:16:51 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

16:16:57 Emily Ford says, "What fun."

16:16:58 Emily Ford slinks east.

16:17:07 Emily Ford slinks in from the east.

16:17:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, the final rage, eh? Well, at least that means there will never be another rage again."

16:17:44 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

16:17:44 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.
Ather Jammoa says, "Unless we're hitting all the rages backward, which probably means that we're going to see all the rages."

16:18:01 Emily Ford says, "Backward rages."

16:18:06 Emily tilts her head to one side.

16:18:07 Ather Jammoa says, "All the raaaaaage."

16:18:44 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

16:18:44 Emily Ford says, "That could ramp up an argument gradually, then it would suddenly stop without anyone remembering what was going on."

16:19:19 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

16:19:20 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

16:19:26 Ather Jammoa chortles.

16:19:27 Emily Ford asks, "So has anything exciting been going on?"

16:19:29 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

16:19:29 Ather Jammoa says, "Na."

16:19:45 Emily Ford says, "Just more credits, how depressing."

16:19:46 Ather Jammoa says, "Few sotrms, few repairs, few systems. Pretty much what you see on the message boards is what we've got."

16:19:54 Emily Ford nods.

16:20:10 Ather Jammoa says, "We've passed by a few oorts here and there, stuff like that."

16:20:19 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

16:20:34 Emily Ford says, "How truly inspiring."

16:20:36 Emily Ford grins.

16:20:38 Emily Ford takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

16:20:47 Ather Jammoa says, "We passed the 1000 lightyear mark yesterday-ish, so we should start seeing some of the stranger things."

16:20:47 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

16:20:47 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

16:20:56 Emily Ford nods to Ather Jammoa.

16:21:20 Emily frowns slightly.

16:21:29 Ather Jammoa asks, "Who's bringing us in?"

16:21:36 Emily Ford says, "Luja."

16:21:38 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

16:21:50 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

16:21:58 Emily Ford says, "Mel's up there too, though she seems to be dozing."

16:22:01 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

16:22:09 Ather Jammoa nods.

16:22:13 Emily says to Ather, "How well did you know James?"

16:22:34 "Pretty well." Ather Jammoa frowns. "Mostly from before the war. Heard he retired."

16:22:47 Emily Ford says, "Retired without a word, nothing."

16:23:01 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

16:23:03 Emily Ford says, "It's so out of character for him. He was always so thoughtful."

16:23:38 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

16:23:39 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

16:23:46 Ather says to Emily, "May not have been his choice. If Nina wants you to do something, because she might have something else on the docket, she'll order anyone, even James, to not say a word."

16:23:50 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

16:24:00 Emily nods slowly.

16:24:10 Emily Ford says, "I hadn't considered that."

16:24:16 Ather Jammoa says, "James was one of the best Fringe pilots out there. Wouldn't surprise me if she might've lined something else up for him."

16:24:28 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

16:25:02 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

16:25:02 Ather Jammoa says, "Maybe she found out about his antispinward jaunt with Sabin. There are literally a lot of things. With the Fringe, things become all the more complicated."

16:25:20 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

16:25:43 Emily inhales a deep breath, holds it a moment then exhales slowly as she nods. "He promised me dinner next time we met. Just as friends though, he's far too busy for anything else..."

16:25:50 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

16:26:02 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

16:26:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, jus tremember, if he didn't give you a heads up that he was retiring, he may have had valid reasons for it. I'm not saying that he does, just that he might."

16:26:41 Emily Ford says, "I did consider that."

16:27:02 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

16:27:24 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

16:27:40 Emily Ford says, "I was trying to think of what he'd say. The only thing I could come up with is that he's only retired, it's not like he's dead or anything."

16:28:02 Ather Jammoa smirks.

16:28:03 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

16:28:06 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

16:28:39 Emily Ford sighs.

16:29:02 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

16:29:03 Emily glances over at the readouts and nodding says, "Looks like we're about there."

16:29:04 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

16:29:37 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

16:29:38 Lily Kaise glides south.

16:30:02 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

16:30:07 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

16:30:09 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

16:30:10 Strange hulks of alien origin litter this region of space, from unrecognizable slag that was never any human design and oddly shaped metal plating to glittering metal devices whose purposes are unknown.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

16:30:10 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Charge holding up well we have a whole 9 percent!"

16:30:19 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

16:30:19 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Neat, we made it!"

16:30:21 Emily Ford says into the PA microphone, "Nicely done, Luja."

16:30:27 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

16:30:32 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Nice!"

16:30:34 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

16:30:35 Emily Ford slinks south.

16:30:58 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

16:31:01 Ather Jammoa presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

16:31:02 Emily Ford's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Are we supposed to be charging up here?"

16:31:24 Ather Jammoa says into the PA microphone, "Don't think so. Just do an image and spectroscopy scan."

16:31:31 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "No idea Almost had the impression Nissi wanted us to go to almost zip before we charged."

16:31:35 Emily Ford's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We only have nine percent charge left."

16:31:45 Emily Ford's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hmm."

16:31:59 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

16:32:03 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

16:32:03 Ather Jammoa strides south.

16:32:24 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "This would be a good area to get debris from though so I doubt we'll die if Nissi yells at us for charging up at 9 percent hehe."

16:32:37 Emily Ford's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Spectroscopy scan started."

16:32:50 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Should I go start up the furnace?"

16:32:58 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Bah, we want better debris for charging anyway. This junk won't burn up well in the furnace."

16:33:40 Lily Kaise says, "Shiwrecks generally yield reasonable stuff and we're not supposed to stop at clusters and oorts but yeah planetary stuff wouldn't be bad."

16:33:50 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

16:34:34 Lily Kaise says, "Well we already have a lot of junk in the hold."

16:34:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:36:59 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

16:37:50 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

16:39:40 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

16:41:59 The computer begins a x-ray spectography program.

16:43:50 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

16:46:59 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

16:47:29 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

16:47:39 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

16:47:39 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

16:47:40 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

16:47:41 The starship has left a unique area of space.

16:47:44 The stellar cartography library will only work in space.

16:47:47 Lily Kaise says, "Good still have 136 MB in the databank."

16:47:49 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

16:47:50 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

16:47:52 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

16:47:52 A readout shows The Final Rage about 103.91 light-cycles toward Galactic Northnorthwest and Slightly Up.
A riftstorm appears to be 15.79 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Down and Slightly Westsouthwest.

16:48:05 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

16:48:21 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa.

16:48:43 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:49:25 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

16:49:31 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:49:40 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:50:12 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

16:51:48 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

16:52:16 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:53:09 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:53:17 Ather Jammoa navigates his black flip einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:53:26 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We're not up I hope!"

16:53:30 Lily Kaise grins.

16:53:35 You grin.

16:53:55 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

16:53:58 Ather Jammoa switches a black flip einrophone off.

16:54:00 Ather Jammoa says, "Problem solved."

16:54:06 Lily Kaise grins.

16:54:15 Lily Kaise says, "Just would reverse it anyway."

16:55:24 Emily Ford's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes, that's what I meant."

16:55:35 Ather Jammoa says into the PA microphone, "No worries."

16:55:37 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Drink coffeeeeeee!"

16:55:47 Emily Ford slinks in from the south.

16:55:50 Emily Ford gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

16:55:52 Emily Ford sits down on a white leather sofa.

16:56:00 Emily Ford rubs her face.

16:56:09 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

16:56:10 Lily Kaise glides east.

16:56:24 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

16:56:29 Lily Kaise gives you a cup of hot cafe mocha.

16:56:36 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

16:56:48 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

16:57:04 Emily says to Lily Kaise, "If you're playing waitress, shouldn't you have an outfit and ask everyone?"

16:57:44 Ather Jammoa says, "I'm going to go check on Skipper."

16:57:46 Ather Jammoa stands up from a white leather sofa.

16:57:52 Ather Jammoa strides south.

16:58:01 Emily Ford says, "I guess not."

16:58:44 I don't see that here.

16:59:30 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Thanks babe."

16:59:34 You can't drink a maple coffee table.

16:59:37 You are carrying a cup of hot cafe mocha in your right hand.

16:59:40 You take a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

16:59:47 "Sure Love!" Lily Kaise smiles at you.

16:59:55 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:00:23 You take a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:00:40 Emily Ford says, "Hopefully someone fun will be awake soon."

17:00:43 Emily Ford glances down at her metallic tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

17:00:53 Luja Garland steps in from the south.

17:01:00 Emily Ford smiles at Luja Garland.

17:01:00 Luja Garland begins sitting comfortably cross-legged on a floor pillow.

17:01:04 Luja Garland waves.

17:01:10 Luja Garland examines a small hot tea dispenser for a moment.

17:01:12 Luja Garland helps herself to a cup of hot red rooibos tea.

17:01:14 You wave to Luja Garland.

17:01:16 You take a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:01:28 You take a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:01:29 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:01:34 You finish off a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:01:34 Emily says to Luja, "I tried to convince Lily to play waitress, she didn't like my suggestion."

17:01:41 Lily Kaise laughs.

17:01:43 Luja Garland asks, "And serve us things?"

17:01:47 Emily Ford nods.

17:01:50 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

17:01:50 You chuckle.

17:01:53 Emily Ford says, "Saves me getting off my ass."

17:02:03 Lily Kaise says, "Oh did you need something emily? I guess my ears were still in a... fog er something."

17:02:08 Luja Garland says, "That would've been really fun."

17:02:21 Emily says to Lily, "I was joking."

17:02:38 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh in there... no no those elbows in the ribs are rough when you have a hot tray of coffess and teas!"

17:02:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

17:02:45 Emily Ford says, "That said, I do have a hooters outfit in my costume box."

17:02:48 Emily Ford chuckles.

17:02:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

17:02:57 You chuckle.

17:02:59 You laugh.

17:03:13 Emily Ford says, "It was what I wore for one of our org anniversary parties."

17:03:17 Luja Garland says, "Let's see it."

17:03:22 Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

17:03:28 You say, "Let Luja try it on."

17:03:36 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:03:39 Luja examines herself. "I don't have the build for that."

17:03:41 Emily Ford says, "It's just a pair of tight shorts and a very low cut top."

17:03:50 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

17:03:53 Emily Ford stands up from a white leather sofa.

17:03:55 Emily Ford slinks west.

17:04:10 Emily Ford slinks in from the west.

17:04:12 Emily Ford sits down on a white leather sofa.

17:04:16 Emily Ford gives a daringly low-cut white cropped top with 'Cat Hooters' spelled out across the front in sparkly purple letters to Luja Garland.

17:04:22 Emily Ford says, "That's the top."

17:05:25 Luja holds up a daringly low-cut white cropped top with 'Cat Hooters' spelled out across the front in sparkly purple letters and examines it.

17:05:51 Emily Ford says, "It's reasonably small."

17:06:00 You nod.

17:06:03 Luja Garland laughs.

17:06:13 Luja Garland says, "That is very low-cut."

17:06:24 You say, "Yes. Yes it is."

17:06:33 Emily Ford says, "I'm told it's the way it's meant to be."

17:06:59 Emily Ford says, "So I wore that with low rise shorts."

17:07:24 Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

17:07:44 Luja Garland says, "Hah."

17:08:02 Luja Garland asks, "Who wanted to try it on, again?"

17:08:06 Luja Garland gives a daringly low-cut white cropped top with 'Cat Hooters' spelled out across the front in sparkly purple letters to Emily Ford.

17:08:09 You say to Luja, "You did."

17:08:12 Emily Ford says, "I do hope I wasn't being exploited or something. I'd never heard of hooters waitresses before that."

17:08:31 Luja Garland snickers at you.

17:08:36 You chuckle.

17:08:55 Emily Ford asks, "I don't think I heard anyone say they were going to try it on, did I?"

17:08:57 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

17:09:08 Emily Ford says, "Unless it was Shule."

17:09:11 You say, "I certainly am not."

17:09:15 You shake your head.

17:09:16 Luja Garland says, "I thought Lily was going to try it on when Shule said I wanted to try it on."

17:09:28 You laugh. "Nope."

17:09:42 Emily says to Lily, "You heard Shule say he wanted to try it on, right?"

17:09:46 You say, "It wouldn't fit me."

17:10:07 Emily Ford sighs.

17:10:10 Emily Ford says, "Oh well."

17:10:48 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

17:10:53 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa.

17:11:01 Lightning suddenly flashes down amongst the flock, and birds cry in fear and beat their wings with new intensity.

17:11:01 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

17:11:03 Emily Ford says, "Ather will say yes."

17:11:04 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

17:11:13 Ather Jammoa asks, "What are we saying yes to?"

17:11:24 Luja Garland says, "Try on a top."

17:11:31 Emily Ford taps a daringly low-cut white cropped top with 'Cat Hooters' spelled out across the front in sparkly purple letters.

17:11:36 You say, "Emily wants some one to try on a waitress outfit."

17:11:36 Ather Jammoa says, "Fuck that shit."

17:11:41 You chuckle.

17:11:52 Emily Ford says, "Hey, I never mentioned anything."

17:12:12 Emily Ford says, "Luja wanted to see it, then somehow it got around to someone agreeing to try it on."

17:12:16 Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

17:12:32 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "If luja wants to see it luja can try it on and look into a full-length mirror!"

17:12:47 Emily Ford says, "Luja doesn't think she's designed for it."

17:13:44 Luja Garland says, "I'm not forcing it on anyone."

17:13:48 Luja Garland takes a sip of a cup of hot red rooibos tea.

17:14:18 Emily says to Luja, "Nobody said you were! We just tried to convince /Shule wihout success."

17:14:25 You laugh.

17:14:32 Luja Garland grins.

17:14:54 Emily folds the top and slips it back into her pack.

17:14:59 Emily Ford puts a daringly low-cut white cropped top with 'Cat Hooters' spelled out across the front in sparkly purple letters in a neon purple leather Business Cats backpack.

17:15:55 Emily Ford says, "We're just trying to inspire some fun."

17:15:56 Emily Ford nods.

17:16:19 You grin at Emily Ford.

17:16:23 Luja Garland says, "Fun is important."

17:17:01 Emily Ford says, "I'm always up for some fun, well except when there's something serious going on."

17:17:03 Emily Ford nods.

17:17:04 Emily Ford stands up from a white leather sofa.

17:17:06 Emily Ford slinks east.

17:17:32 Emily Ford slinks in from the east.

17:17:35 Emily Ford sits down on a white leather sofa.

17:17:45 Emily Ford selects a single fluffy popped kernel from a small red and white bag of hot popcorn with extra butter and eats it.

17:17:56 Luja Garland takes a sip of a cup of hot red rooibos tea.

17:18:06 Emily Ford crunches her snack.

17:18:39 Luja says to Emily, "Did you know Pierre brought his hot tub?"

17:18:56 Emily Ford says, "I had heard that, yes."

17:18:58 Emily Ford nods.

17:19:10 Emily Ford says, "I wouldn't expect any less from Pierre."

17:19:14 Emily Ford grins.

17:19:17 Emily Ford reaches repeatedly into a small red and white bag of hot popcorn with extra butter, coming up with single kernels of popcorn and tossing them into her mouth one by one.

17:19:30 Luja Garland grins.

17:19:31 You grin.

17:20:18 Emily Ford says, "I'm sure he figured that nobody would bring a bathing suit onto a deep space expedition."

17:20:37 Luja Garland says, "I did. A few of 'em, in fact."

17:20:46 Luja Garland says, "Though I forgot to bring spare trunks."

17:21:01 Emily Ford says, "I never wear trunks."

17:21:39 You say, "Yeah, I forgot my swim trunks."

17:21:48 You say, "Guess I'm not going in the hot tub."

17:22:22 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves in from the south.

17:22:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Allo."

17:22:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sits down on a white leather sofa.

17:22:38 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Raaaaage."

17:22:50 Emily says to you, "Afraid of people seeing your nudger."

17:22:55 Emily says to Pierre-Louis, "Hi."

17:23:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Many allos."

17:23:23 You wave to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

17:23:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec waves.

17:24:35 Emily says to Pierre-Louis, "Be excited for the rage."

17:25:02 Luja Garland says, "Hi, Pierre."

17:25:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Many his."

17:25:51 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

17:27:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Must still find super cool thing to observe."

17:27:44 Emily Ford says, "We almost did."

17:27:54 Emily Ford says, "Except Shule refused to wear it."

17:28:56 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

17:28:57 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

17:29:09 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

17:29:11 Luja Garland waves to Vernos Bailey.

17:29:16 Vernos Bailey waves.

17:29:19 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

17:29:24 You wave to Vernos Bailey.

17:29:26 Emily Ford says, "AEU alert."

17:29:32 Vernos Bailey says, "Woo pushing the boundries of charge."

17:29:34 Emily Ford gets a handful of popcorn from a small red and white bag of hot popcorn with extra butter and eats it several kernels at a time.

17:29:39 Vernos Bailey says, "Eight percent."

17:29:53 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Still time to find nice thing to stop at."

17:29:59 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

17:33:50 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

17:34:08 Emily Ford eats a few fluffy kernels from a small red and white bag of hot popcorn with extra butter.

17:34:53 Emily Ford digs down into a small red and white bag of hot popcorn with extra butter, coming up with a half dozen fluffy kernels, which she eats all at once.

17:35:50 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

17:37:11 Emily Ford gets a handful of popcorn from a small red and white bag of hot popcorn with extra butter and eats it.

17:37:44 Vernos Bailey removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly into a standard starship flightbag.

17:37:49 Vernos Bailey says, "I was prepared."

17:37:51 Vernos Bailey laughs.

17:37:57 Luja Garland grins.

17:37:59 Emily Ford grins.

17:38:26  You are wearing a light gray shipsuit with silvery gray trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

17:38:26 You are carrying a cup in your right hand.

17:39:18 Emily Ford eats several small but fluffy popped kernels from a small red and white bag of hot popcorn with extra butter.

17:40:11 Vernos Bailey says, "Bettter safe than waking up in a rescue pod."

17:40:30 Luja Garland says, "Shorter walk."

17:41:08 Emily Ford tips a small red and white bag of hot popcorn with extra butter, shakes the last of its contents into her mouth, then crumples up the empty container and tosses it into a nearby trash bin.

17:45:02 Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah."

17:48:34 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

17:49:37 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

17:49:47 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

18:02:17 The room ceases to spin.

18:02:17 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

18:02:20 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

18:03:50 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

18:05:50 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

18:06:08 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh hey, the storm disipated. What timing."

18:07:18 The crowd stands up to jeer. The room seems to spin rapidly around you.

18:07:18 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

18:07:21 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

18:07:32 Ather Jammoa says, "Wow. Didn't even see it."

18:07:57 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We must reach the 500 LTC barrier."

18:09:04 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Or thousand, thousand would be good."

18:11:03 Luja Garland asks, "What's that?"

18:11:12 Luja Garland asks, "I mean, what's beyond that?"

18:12:22 The room ceases to spin.

18:12:22 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

18:12:25 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

18:12:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Beyond the 1000 LTC barrier lies a wonderful thing."

18:12:38 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Notably the 1,001th of the LTC."

18:12:43 Luja Garland says, "We have to find it."

18:13:02 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "We're going to lreave you there."

18:13:02 Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.

18:13:23 Pierre-Louis says to Ather, "Best will send blockading task force to save me."

18:13:24 Lily Kaise says, "That would be a good thing ifever we can maintain enough charge to make it that far."

18:13:32 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Bah."

18:13:56 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "You can go very far if your destination allows you to charge up and repair furnace or if you don't intend to come back."

18:14:02 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

18:14:16 Lily Kaise says, "We probably could get pretty close and just pod back."

18:17:49 Ather Jammoa says, "Definitely not going to scuttle this ship, too much valuable tech aboard. Not to mention the bolt and the aggressor."

18:17:51 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

18:18:55 Luja Garland says, "If we can all squeeze together on the next biggest ship docked, we can fly even further."

18:19:11 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I think both of them are about the same size!"

18:19:44 Luja Garland exclaims, "Nice!"

18:19:51 Luja Garland asks, "Does it also have a furnace?"

18:19:52 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

18:20:06 Ather Jammoa says, "Na, bolt has solar panels. Aggressor doesn't have anything, I'm pretty sure."

18:28:16 Ather Jammoa sighs. "Looks like I'm going to have to rearrange the table of contents again."

18:28:19 Ather Jammoa says, "Curses."

18:28:32 Luja tilts her head curiously at Ather.

18:28:35 Luja Garland asks, "What book?"

18:28:43 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

18:28:44 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

18:30:23 Eli Grey helps himself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

18:30:30 Eli Grey zips up a silver flightsuit with an AEU shoulder patch and fastens a button on his shoulder.

18:30:40 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

18:30:54 Eli Grey asks, "Looks like I slept through a couple of nice finds, four planets on that last system eh?"

18:31:06 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

18:31:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

18:31:46 Eli Grey says, "Well.. considering that no one looks drunk, and everyone is fully clothed, I can only assume that none of them were the party planet."

18:31:54 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

18:31:57 Melinda Michaels grins. "Nope."

18:32:47 Luja Garland says, "We're all decent folk."

18:33:11 Melinda says to Luja, "We are?"

18:34:01 Melinda Michaels smiles.

18:34:04 Eli Grey laughs.

18:34:29 Ather mutters something and jots down a few notes.

18:34:31 Eli says to Melinda, "Is tha the same coffee you were drinking when I went to bed?"

18:34:46 Melinda says to Eli, "Probably not but it too needs to go."

18:34:53 Eli Grey chuckles.

18:34:56 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

18:34:57 Melinda Michaels gives a day old cup of room temperature black coffee to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

18:35:04 Luja Garland grins.

18:35:05 Luja Garland finishes off a cup of hot red rooibos tea.

18:38:25 d, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

18:38:32 Luja says to Ather, "What're you writing?"

18:38:34 Eli Grey says to Ather, "Everything alright?"

18:38:35 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh well."

18:38:39 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

18:38:46 Ather says to Luja, "Oh, just updating the pilot's guide to starships and upgrades."

18:39:09 Ather Jammoa says, "Many updates."

18:39:17 Eli Grey asks, "Oh, is it for the next edition? Or are you already preparing for the one you'll have to do a week after that one?"

18:39:27 Ather Jammoa says, "I don't even think I have cryosuspension in it."

18:39:34 Ather Jammoa says, "Definitely needs updating."

18:39:43 Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

18:39:49 Eli Grey puts a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar on a maple coffee table.

18:39:52 Eli Grey removes a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

18:39:54 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

18:39:56 Eli Grey begins reading in a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

18:40:00 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh wow."

18:40:01 Ather Jammoa says, "It does."

18:40:24 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

18:40:41 Eli Grey nods.

18:41:45 Ather Jammoa says, "I hate adding on extra pages."

18:41:53 Ather Jammoa says, "It means I have to write all the pages after the new ones."

18:42:04 Melinda Michaels grins.

18:42:22 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh well, luckily I was smart and left exploration towards nearly the end of the book."

18:43:04 Ather Jammoa says, "It still means I have to rewrite an extra 14 pages, but well."

18:43:40 Ather Jammoa says, "Man, I really wrote out the table of contents awesomely."

18:43:43 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

18:43:44 Eli Grey grins.

18:43:48 Ather Jammoa says, "I forgot I wrote most of that shit."

18:43:59 Ather Jammoa says, "I practically had to rewrite the damn thing from scratch."

18:44:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Send all probes."

18:44:12 Eli Grey closes a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

18:44:13 Eli Grey puts a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

18:44:19 Eli Grey removes a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar from a maple coffee table.

18:44:21 Eli Grey finishes off a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

18:44:32 Eli Grey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

18:44:39 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

18:45:18 Ather Jammoa says, "I wonder if I should put any comments about the bypass key in the pilot's guide to preparation."

18:45:32 Eli Grey asks, "I overheard someone mentioning that, what is the bypass key?"

18:45:42 Ather Jammoa says, "Basically allows you to fire your weapons without a confirmation prompt."

18:45:45 Ather Jammoa says, "But, it's illegal."

18:45:50 Eli Grey says, "Oh, yeah I heard about that."

18:46:02 Ather Jammoa says, "If someone catches you using it, notably the engineer of the ship in question or anyone who tags you, they can arrest you for it."

18:46:19 Eli Grey says, "I wouldn't want one of those anyways Idon't think. Maybe on a fighter, but it's not really that much of an advantage."

18:46:29 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly. "I've played around with it. Wasn't overly impressed."

18:46:55 Ather Jammoa says, "Maybe I'll mess around with it a couple more times and see how it is."

18:47:23 Melinda Michaels says, "I've never checked those out."

18:47:37 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

18:47:53 Eli Grey says, "Suppose it could be convenient, though I can't help but think of all the times I cancled my shot because a friendly had replaced my intended target."

18:47:55 Ather Jammoa says, "I wonder if it decreases the effectiveness of the weapons."

18:48:02 Ather says to Eli, "Me, too."

18:48:09 Eli Grey says, "I heard something like that, that it makes it hard to retain locks."

18:48:22 Eli Grey shrugs.

18:48:34 Ather Jammoa says, OOCly, "Changelog said that was removed, but I'm pretty sure that's retconned, which is why I didn't bring it up."

18:48:56 Eli Grey says, OOCly, "My bad, I didn't realy get what that changelog meant u ntil now."

18:49:02 Eli Grey shrugs.

18:49:16 Ather Jammoa says, "More testing! Always more testing."

18:49:19 Eli Grey says, "People say crazy things in the lounge, you overhear a lot of shit that doesn't always check out."

18:49:23 Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.

18:49:29 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, it's a weird thing."

18:49:50 Melinda Michaels says, "I think, if you put that in the book, I'd make sure to tell the pilots you aren't endorsing the product."

18:49:54 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

18:50:05 Eli Grey says, "There's always this guy in the Fringe lounge who likes to brag that he stole a battlecruiser, but he sure clams up when you start asking to check it out. He gets all full of excuses."

18:50:11 Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

18:50:14 Ather says to Melinda, "Oh yeah, for sure."

18:50:27 The curtains close, to no applause.

18:50:37 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

18:50:37 Ather Jammoa says, "It's one of those things where I write about objectively, kinda like I did for the cracker. Jus ttell people wha tit does, and consequences."

18:50:42 Melinda Michaels says, "Some idiot will say, it was in Ather's book so I assumed it was good to use."

18:50:44 Melinda Michaels laughs.

18:51:04 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

18:51:19 Eli poses comically.

18:51:31 Ather Jammoa says, "But yeah, preparation is definitely due for an update too."

18:51:37 Eli Grey exclaims, "Tired of having control of where your shots go? Try Ather Jammoa vrand bypass key!"

18:51:42 Melinda Michaels giggles.

18:52:17 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I keep stealing battlecruisers but when I try to show it to anyone somenone else already stole it."

18:52:27 Eli Grey chuckles at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

18:52:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Maybe it's time I finally finish up my mystery project too."

18:52:40 Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

18:52:50 Eli says to Ather, "Wow is that the same one you've been working on since way back?"

18:52:59 Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.

18:53:05 Eli Grey whistles.

18:53:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I'm sure Best is preparing vast fleet of battlecruisers with massive AEU wealth."

18:53:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Every time I decide "oh, time to finally finish it" something else attracts my attention and I abandon it."

18:53:26 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

18:54:07 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "Yeah, you'd think that, but so far all I've sen is him stop manufacture on some great ships, and try to give his brother a valuable military contract."

18:54:18 Ather Jammoa says, "This fucking shopping book shit is really annoying the fuck out of me. I'm going to not even include that shit in the book anymore."

18:54:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "A corrupt politician? Why I never."

18:54:28 Eli Grey grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

18:55:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I'm sure that money saved on those useless exploratory designs will be reinvested in his accounts later."

18:56:06 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "Yeah exactly. I am not a big fan of the decision to cancel those ships, but let's at least some of that go where he said it would go."

18:56:07 Ather Jammoa says, "Hmm, I wonder if the seriousness of bari is still being sold."

18:56:38 Melinda Michaels says, "It was when I last checked the bookstore. That was, a couple weeks ago."

18:56:47 Ather Jammoa says, "Excellent."

18:57:52 Vernos says to Ather, "I'll take over your AEU book if you like."

18:57:58 Melinda Michaels laughs.

18:58:15 Vernos says to Melinda, "Hey, I am just trying to help."

18:58:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Somebody needs to take over Johann's and whomever did it before him. Ours has got pretty big."

18:58:36 Pierre-Louis says to Eli, "Ships with many lasers."

18:58:39 Eli Grey says, "As I think I heard Aher say yesterday, I'm not really opposed to strenghtening our military, there's good reasons for that. I just don't like how it's going down, or rather not going down."

18:58:43 Ather says to Vernos, "Bah, I don't trust anyone else to write it like I write it."

18:58:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Pew pew."

18:58:52 Ather Jammoa says, "But thanks."

18:58:54 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "Lazy beams!"

18:59:01 Vernos says to Ather, "Sure thing."

18:59:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "AEU current pew pew ships looks fine to me."

18:59:18 Eli Grey nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

18:59:18 Melinda Michaels grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

18:59:49 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Oh I dunno. I'd like to see some better smaller pew pew ships."

18:59:56 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, I don't think Outsiders see a Pulsar jump in and think " Oh good ti's just a Pulsar, we're fine""

19:00:02 Vernos says to Eli, "I'm not against some militiarzation."

19:00:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Bah, Best will think big."

19:00:14 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "So big."

19:00:15 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean the combat scout is pretty decent, the clipper is awesome, but you relaly don't have much else."

19:00:30 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

19:00:32 Vernos says to Eli, "But I feel like Best is forgetting what is supposed to be the true backbone of the AEU."

19:00:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Mining?"

19:00:44 Melinda Michaels grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

19:00:44 Ather Jammoa gives Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec a high five.

19:00:52 Ather Jammoa says, "Mining is the pinnacle of human evolution."

19:00:56 Eli Grey laughs.

19:01:13 Vernos says to Pierre-Louis, "In your corner QE boy."

19:01:15 Eli Grey says, "I thought he was going to say mail delivery."

19:01:22 Eli Grey says, "The Postal Allience."

19:01:22 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, he can use all that raw minerals to build big ships."

19:01:28 Melinda says to Eli, "Times change though. League used to be very industrious with trading and the like. Now we are the explorers."

19:01:36 Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.

19:01:57 Ather Jammoa says, "Why do people keep asking me to add atmospheric scooping to the credit-making activities section! I specifically said in my notes, that I'll only put in activities that you don't need to spend credits on right away except for your first ship."

19:02:02 Ather Jammoa mutters.

19:02:05 Ather Jammoa says, "Stupid, stupid people."

19:02:10 Eli says to Melinda, "In a way, you were the original explorers, but still."

19:02:11 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Scoop, scoop."

19:02:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Same fucking reason I never added in Teslaworld."

19:02:39 Ather Jammoa asks, "Which cadet is going to have 20 million EAOS credits right away?"

19:02:53 Vernos says to Melinda, "The newer AEU pilots want to return to exploration but I get the feeling we will be fighting Best ever step of the way."

19:03:03 Melinda says to Eli, "Sure we were but, th ings change. Even when AEU was big in exploring, they liked to do it near home."

19:03:17 Eli says to Vernos, "Best can't really do anything to stop us from exploring."

19:03:20 Eli Grey grins.

19:03:24 Eli Grey says, "Aside make it illegal."

19:03:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "No more road trips, said the Best."

19:03:58 Melinda says to Ather, "Did Kim ever sort out what this trade issue was?"

19:04:03 Vernos says to Pierre-Louis, "Yet five of us here ignored what came out of his mouth."

19:04:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, is not a law yet."

19:05:02 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

19:05:19 Vernos Bailey says, "All I will say is, that I am hoping the AEU pilots will fight President Best to keep at least one alliance based exploration ship availble."

19:05:35 Vernos Bailey says, "That is not the scout."

19:05:39 Melinda Michaels asks, "You currently have, how many?"

19:05:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Rent a tac platform."

19:05:57 Vernos Bailey says, "The tactical platform and a scout, Melinda."

19:06:00 Eli Grey says, "We have the Scout, that's the only one we have I'm pretty sure."

19:06:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Not like the Magnetar ever went anywhere."

19:06:14 Melinda Michaels says, "Nothing wrong with the platform."

19:06:19 Ather Jammoa asks, "Why not the platform?"

19:06:22 Ather Jammoa says, "No one considers it."

19:06:30 Vernos Bailey says, "It is not an AEU ship."

19:06:32 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

19:06:33 Vernos Bailey says, "Anyone can get it."

19:06:33 Ather Jammoa says, "It's a more than capable exploration ship which Best can't remove."

19:06:35 Melinda Michaels says, "I've gone on a trip ortwo in one."

19:06:42 Ather says to Vernos, "So?"

19:06:49 Vernos says to Ather, "AEU pride?"

19:06:54 Ather Jammoa says, "Doesn't mean it's not an exploration ship you can use to prove yourself, and your desires to explore."

19:07:09 Melinda says to Vernos, "You are probably gonna hafta start with a ship that anyone can get. Rather than trying to be lofty and convince him you need your own."

19:07:17 Ather says to Vernos, "Dress it up in AEU colors, rent it and give it an AEU transponder. Bam. AEU pride."

19:07:53 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly I am hoping he will allow the Magnetar to be produced again if enough truly show the desire to explore."

19:08:05 Vernos Bailey says, "Or the Arrow."

19:08:20 Vernos Bailey says, "But we do need to act instead of talk."

19:08:24 Eli Grey says, "Or at least release a couple of them, I'ms ure there's a couple just sitting in a garage somewhere since no one was ever able to purchase one."

19:08:30 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

19:08:30 Ather says to Vernos, "Well, if people start actually leading expeditions instead of just talking about leading expeditions...Maybe something cna happen!"

19:08:39 Vernos says to Ather, "Agreed."

19:08:46 Eli Grey finishes off a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

19:09:23 Melinda Michaels says, "Kim's org has a platform. Somebody get her on the ball."

19:09:25 Vernos says to Ather, "I see both arguments so please don't mistake that I am just anti everything. Best has decent reasons for wanting to do military equipment."

19:09:32 Ather Jammoa says, "No."

19:09:38 Eli says to Melinda, "No way, already building my own."

19:09:40 Eli Grey laughs.

19:09:44 Ather Jammoa says, "Best has the wrong reasons for wanting military equipment. However, we're going to improvize on his reasons."

19:09:48 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

19:09:59 Vernos says to Ather, "Alright, works for me."

19:10:16 Melinda Michaels says, "Her League trustee renting the org ship and doing trips doesn't really count."

19:10:16 Ather Jammoa says, "No one really wants to go to war with the other alliances, but we can definitely start using the ships against Outsiders, IFS, Kelsey."

19:10:18 Melinda Michaels grins.

19:10:19 Eli says to Melinda, "Nothing wrong with doing it that way of course, but this stuff is why I became a pilot to begin with, no reason for me not to get my own."

19:10:20 Vernos says to Ather, "I will still persue getting AEU pilots in the spirit of exploring."

19:10:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Hey, Lily has lead mighty expeditions."

19:10:32 Ather Jammoa says, "I still want to find his station and set up an explosive device in the fusion reactor."

19:11:04 Melinda Michaels says, "Well I want to use my probes."

19:11:09 Melinda Michaels says, "So."

19:11:29 Melinda Michaels says, "Everybody is going to want to be going somewhere."

19:11:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "And Annie found most holy Gunarsh before. Mighty explorer of the AEU."

19:11:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup she sure did."

19:11:46 Melinda Michaels says, "Then she did other stuff."

19:11:54 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

19:12:18 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "She hit the top on her first attempt, could only go down from there."

19:12:26 Vernos says to Ather, "I want to eventually lead an expedition back toward the galactic core."

19:12:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Most of us go towards that area."

19:12:38 Lily Kaise chuckles.

19:12:48 Melinda Michaels says, "It's called coreward."

19:12:50 Melinda Michaels beams.

19:12:57 Lily Kaise says, "What grande ideas."

19:12:57 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Toward indeed."

19:13:09 Vernos Bailey says, "I meant like to the extent that he has been on wayyyy back."

19:13:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Hmm, will need faster and more reliable drive than these rift things."

19:13:27 Melinda Michaels says, "You won't make it there with current equipment."

19:13:41 Ather Jammoa chuckles. "Won't even make it a tenth of the way."

19:13:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Steal the Lowell."

19:13:46 Vernos Bailey says, "Dream big, aim reasonable."

19:14:03 Eli Grey asks, "All the way to the galactic core?"

19:14:08 Eli Grey says, "That's very very far."

19:14:08 Melinda Michaels says, "This ship here can push 2000 light-years and it won't make it."

19:14:12 Melinda Michaels grins.

19:14:18 Ather Jammoa says, "The core is like 100 thousand."

19:14:21 Ather Jammoa says, "If not more."

19:14:23 Eli Grey nods to Ather Jammoa.

19:14:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Steal the Lowell, reach core while flipping index finger at large pursuing Outsider fleets."

19:14:31 Ather Jammoa says, "I have to look back at my old galactic coordinates."

19:15:06 Vernos Bailey says, "I still want to figure out how close to Jinu space we can probe without getting an Outsider fleet response."

19:15:16 Melinda Michaels says, "But yeah, you gotta start somewhere in hopes and dreams."

19:15:16 Eli Grey says, "Legend has it, that at the very center of the Galactic Core, there's just a giant sign floating in space that reads "YOUWIN""

19:15:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "This ship could do way more than two thousands... if you didn't mind leave it floating in space forever."

19:15:26 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters east.

19:15:40 Melinda Michaels nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

19:16:01 Vernos says to Ather, "What is honestly my major desire."

19:16:20 Aisling the Fox prances in from the south.

19:16:21 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

19:16:21 Vernos Bailey says, "Figure out how close we can get without bringing about doomsday."

19:16:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec exclaims, "The Winner Is You!"

19:16:42 Aisling the Fox waves.

19:16:45 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

19:16:51 Eli nods in greeting to Aisling.

19:17:07 Vernos says to Ather, "Did we ever discuss how far you thought that was?"

19:17:17 Ather Jammoa asks, "What, Jinu space?"

19:17:17 Pierre-Louis says to Vernos, "Not sure I follow your strategery. Try to get ever slightly closer each time with super long range ship like Odyssey until they kill at the Jinu on the closest attempt?"

19:17:25 Ather Jammoa says, "Probably around 5-10000."

19:17:28 Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

19:17:30 Aisling the Fox prances south.

19:17:30 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

19:17:35 Aisling the Fox prances in from the south.

19:17:35 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

19:17:41 Ather Jammoa says, "But space is so big that we could easily pass it with current equipment."

19:17:52 Ather Jammoa says, "Even if we had the tech to reach it."

19:17:53 Vernos says to Ather, "I mean how close we could get without bringing down the Outsiders to wipe us out."

19:17:57 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh."

19:17:59 Ather Jammoa says, "Fuck if I know."

19:18:13 Ather Jammoa says, "No one knows the strength of their sensors."

19:18:19 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Odyssey might make it if it could stop to repair and recharge at the farther human outpost."

19:18:35 Aisling the Fox asks, "Go where now?"

19:18:40 Vernos says to Pierre-Louis, "I enjoy speculation and conversation."

19:18:41 Ather Jammoa says, "Jinu space."

19:18:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Jinuland, I guess."

19:18:46 Eli Grey says, "That's given that any of this stuff is even still there. For all we know they're all wiped out."

19:19:05 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

19:19:18 Eli Grey says, "I remember a transmission that we received that came in years after everyting, it just took the message that long to reach us."

19:19:25 Eli Grey says, "And it sounded pretty grim."

19:19:35 Vernos says to Aisling, "Was asking how close ather thought we could get to Jinu space without daring the Outsiders to kill us all."

19:19:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "But then you'd just have a ship with no power left and limited weapons in occupied jinuland."

19:20:25 Vernos says to Pierre-Louis, "I'm just making idle conversation."

19:20:42 Vernos Bailey says, "I leave the real Jinu hunting to the Accord and Lowell."

19:20:53 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "That's when the local Mothership jumps in and destroy it in one low-power disruptor shot."

19:20:59 Eli Grey winces.

19:21:37 Vernos Bailey says, "Does make me wonder if the mothership in our area was the same one that montiored Jinu space."

19:21:44 Ather Jammoa says, "Doubtful."

19:21:49 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Gonna guess no."

19:22:05 Eli Grey says, "Different juridictions or something I would imagine."

19:22:09 Eli Grey says, "Er.. jurisdictions."

19:22:10 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah."

19:22:21 Aisling the Fox sits down on a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

19:22:32 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "If they spared one for lizards and humans, they could do so for much technologically superior species."

19:22:55 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, the Jinu outpaced us with tech pretty soundly."

19:23:05 Ather Jammoa says, "Especially exploration and plasma-related tech."

19:23:34 Vernos Bailey asks, "Ever wondered how much better they faired in the battle once the sides were cut off?"

19:23:42 Vernos Bailey says, "Since their tech was better."

19:24:13 Eli Grey says, "That one transmission a few years back didn't sound like they faird very well."

19:24:22 Eli Grey frowns.

19:24:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "That it not followed by any soon after is bad sign."

19:24:43 Eli Grey nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

19:24:52 Eli Grey says, "I'll be honest, I cried a little when that came in."

19:24:57 Vernos Bailey says, "I guess I missed a transmission."

19:25:03 Ather Jammoa switches on a personal filing computer.

19:25:12 Eli Grey says, "I was having a bad day too, and was grumbling, then that message came in and I felt super selfish."

19:25:31 Vernos Bailey asks, "Anyone got a record of it?"

19:25:37 Ather Jammoa recites:

19:25:37  
          "Munroujuhk derxijutyo, ss kiinek hu renfi hu hirp.
           Jumun romuni bruyi i Mir uiily? Poae-"
 

19:25:47 Vernos Bailey asks, "What does that mean?"

19:25:48 Eli says to Vernos, "It was actually pretty easy to miss, it just came in suddenly with one transmission that no one was expecting."

19:25:51 Lily Kaise says, "Oo break out the translator."

19:26:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Pilotes voted to use Lowell to scout out Jinuland first, but it seems whole plan is not prepared yet."

19:26:29 Vernos Bailey says, "All I understand is Mir."

19:26:59 Eli Grey pats Vernos Bailey on the back.

19:27:00 Vernos Bailey says, "And Munroujuhk."

19:27:08 Vernos Bailey says, "Which is the beacons."

19:27:12 Aisling the Fox says, "That is word I have heard before."

19:27:16 Eli Grey says, "Nobody's trying to say anything bad about it, we've all had ideas that have been shot down by new information."

19:27:42 Ather Jammoa recites:

19:27:43  
          "Communicator destroy will held as long as can
           Have hostile arrive at Mir yet please"
 

19:27:58 Ather Jammoa beams at a somewhat battered and worn Jinu translator.

19:28:09 Vernos Bailey says, "Oh yeah they arrived in force."

19:28:13 Vernos Bailey asks, "When was this?"

19:28:28 Ather Jammoa says, "Back in 2311."

19:29:03 Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah I do not remember this, perhaps I was in my own world back thhen."

19:29:14 Ather Jammoa says, "It was kept relatively quiet."

19:29:24 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

19:29:38 Ather Jammoa says, "The transmition was relayed to us over the tactical comms, and we didn't mention it too much within prying eyes, or prying ears."

19:29:54 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

19:30:00 Vernos Bailey asks, "Do you have a book of the Jinu language I could learn from?"

19:30:22 Lily Kaise says, "A book, that would be a marvelous thing."

19:30:24 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

19:30:30 Ather Jammoa says, "A lot of us have kept jinu dictionaries, but they're incomplete, since we use to rely a lot on the translators."

19:30:40 Ather Jammoa says, "James had probably the most complete Jinu dictionary."

19:30:51 Vernos Bailey asks, "Could I see yours one day?"

19:30:56 Ather Jammoa says, "Mine isn't particularly amazing."

19:31:05 Ather says to Vernos, "We'll see!"

19:31:17 Vernos Bailey says, "I am confused."

19:31:43 Vernos Bailey asks, "2311, did they think it would take that long for the Outsiders to reach us?"

19:31:54 Ather Jammoa says, "You are confused."

19:32:11 Ather Jammoa says, "The message was actually transmitted around the time that the Outsider launched their initial assault, based on what we've gathered."

19:32:12 Vernos Bailey says, "Yes, my mind is confused on confused on itself."

19:32:29 Ather Jammoa says, "It took -that- long for it to reach us, because the triangulation devices were destroyed."

19:32:36 Vernos Bailey says, "Wow."

19:32:38 Vernos Bailey nods.

19:32:40 Eli Grey nods.

19:32:47 Eli Grey says, "They couldn't use wormhole communication."

19:32:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Okay now you have unravelled my confusion."

19:32:59 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, they basically transmitted it and hoped."

19:33:32 Vernos Bailey says, "Wonder if we could send one back and just hope like they did."

19:33:37 Ather Jammoa says, "Still can't do anything about it until we can figure out a way to mask the Lowell's signature."

19:33:38 Vernos Bailey says, "Or have you already."

19:33:46 Eli Grey nods to Ather Jammoa.

19:33:56 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

19:34:10 Ather says to Vernos, "We never had exploration tech even half as strong as theirs. That includes those kinds of transmitters. Even the one at the torus can only send so far."

19:34:21 Lily Kaise strokes a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

19:34:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Oh okay."

19:34:26 Eli Grey says, "And gotta keep it as much of a secret as possible too. The last thing we need is for the Outssiders to find out that the Lowell is gone fishing."

19:34:27 Vernos Bailey says, "Learn new stuff everyday."

19:34:51 Vernos Bailey says, "What about a cloak."

19:34:57 Vernos Bailey says, "Would that mask it."

19:35:04 Ather Jammoa says, "Even at best case, that thing can transmit at about 250 lightyears. However, even if we just aimed it coreward, set power to 100%, that's an extremely tight beam. Odds are it'll miss them completely."

19:35:16 Ather Jammoa says, "If it even reaches them, which it probably won't."

19:35:31 Eli Grey says, "It would be hard to find a tailor that would make a cloak that big, and I think the Outsiders would still recognize it, even if we put giant sunglasses on it."

19:35:38 Vernos Bailey says, "Only reason we got it was because they knew exactly where to aim."

19:35:49 Vernos Bailey asks, "Right?"

19:35:53 Ather Jammoa says, "Pretty much. We no longer have access to galactic map units."

19:36:12 Lily Kaise chuckles at Eli Grey.

19:36:19 Eli Grey grins at Lily Kaise.

19:36:31 Eli Grey says, "Have to transmit an innocent whistle as it flew away."

19:36:33 Eli Grey laughs.

19:36:35 Lily Kaise laughs.

19:36:57 Vernos Bailey says, "I had idea for decoy signature but now thinking on that, it would only work once."

19:37:08 Vernos Bailey says, "And would cost us a lot of ships."

19:37:32 Eli says to Vernos, "I thought it was a pretty solid idea, there's just technical difficulties involved I think."

19:37:54 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

19:38:06 Eli Grey says, "It would certainly be awesome if we could mask a smaller ships signature with a larger ones, but I am pretty sure they're sensors are too good for that."

19:38:19 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:38:20 Lily Kaise glides south.

19:38:22 Eli Grey says, "I mean, I can even pick that up on my long range scanner."

19:38:24 Eli Grey shrugs.

19:38:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Here's the problem with that."

19:38:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Dunno if you can make a rift probe looks like the Lowell from afar."

19:38:40 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo we still have 6 percent of charge!"

19:38:47 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

19:38:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "If you can, send probes everywhere."

19:38:52 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:38:55 Melinda Michaels says, "If you use a larger ship to mask a smaller ship, they still get the reading from the larger ship."

19:38:56 Eli noggles at Pierre-Louis.

19:39:09 Melinda Michaels says, "So, even if the smaller ship gets through they've got us."

19:39:10 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

19:39:11 Vernos Bailey says, "I'd launch a group of probes and make them give off the signature of the lowell."

19:39:16 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

19:39:31 Vernos Bailey says, "Then that way it looks like two lowells."

19:39:44 Lily Kaise says, "Only have one."

19:39:45 Eli Grey says, "Making them give off the signature of the Lowell I dno't think would work.. you'd ahve to have some massive power soruces on those little probes for one."

19:39:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Thousands of Lowell everywhere."

19:39:47 Melinda Michaels says, "The ideal way to go is mask the larger ship so we go undetected. Otherwise, they know we are looking and will step up their game in a huge way."

19:40:03 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Millions."

19:40:09 Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.

19:40:14 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Lowells everywhere, in all directions."

19:40:26 Eli says to Melinda, "I do like the idea of using deceptive energy signatures though."

19:40:43 Vernos Bailey asks, "Wonder if the Accord has considered it?"

19:40:52 Melinda says to Eli, "Sure but there again, if we get caught fishing, we are fucked."

19:40:58 Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

19:41:08 Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.

19:41:19 Eli says to Melinda, "I mean for something besides getting to Jinu space."

19:41:30 Lily Kaise says, "Only if it could be deployed remotely and... that would be interesting."

19:41:32 Eli Grey shrugs.

19:41:35 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly we are fucked without the Jinu if the Outsiders ever find the Mutuality."

19:41:53 Melinda Michaels says, "You send something in there looking like the Lowell, they are gonna blow us out of the sky."

19:42:03 Eli Grey nods.

19:42:11 Eli Grey says, "They go apeshit as soon as the Lowell is detected."

19:42:18 Melinda says to Vernos, "If they ever find the Mutuality, we are fucked no matter what."

19:42:24 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah... we got us a big one!"

19:42:28 Lily Kaise laughs.

19:42:29 Vernos says to Melinda, "Yup, that is what I was saying."

19:42:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "They will find the Mutuality, eventually."

19:43:07 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, it almost happened sooner rather than later thanks to Mister ping and Gray."

19:43:23 Eli Grey asks, "Grey?"

19:43:30 Vernos says to Melinda, "I have wondered if making nice with the IFS would help us with the Jinu."

19:43:31 Melinda Michaels says, "Jonathan Gray."

19:43:38 Eli Grey asks, "Oh jeez that was him that did that?"

19:43:40 Eli Grey groans.

19:43:44 Melinda Michaels nods.

19:44:07 Melinda Michaels says, "Keegan sent the ping, Gray pointed the pod towards Helios."

19:44:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Deitz ran the trip that took them into outsider space because he wouldn't ask questions prior to leaving."

19:44:58 Vernos says to Ather, "Do the IFS ever try to communicate outside of just trying to destroy us on sight?"

19:44:58 Lily Kaise says, "Yup which he denies heh but I observed him do it after he had been cautioned not to."

19:45:00 Melinda Michaels shrugs. "So it was fucked from the get go."

19:45:03 Eli says to Vernos, "There was a meeting a long time ago to decide if the Lowell would go for Jinu or IFS first, Jinu won the vote, but there was some very valid points made about going to the IFS first that I tend to agree with."

19:45:23 Eli Grey says, "Mainly, getting their help in assisting the Jinu, which makes lots of sense."

19:45:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Don't much care where Lowell goes, I just want to be on it. So shiny."

19:45:53 Vernos Bailey asks, "Anyone ever thought of holding a re-vote?"

19:45:57 Melinda Michaels says, "When the outsiders came into that IFS beacon the other day, I went into the control room and tried talking to them."

19:46:11 Melinda Michaels says, "Told Morris to not target the IFS."

19:46:14 Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.

19:46:27 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

19:46:37 Eli Grey says, "I've tried contacting them lots of times. I can only hope that it's at least reported back."

19:46:42 Vernos Bailey says, "Sorry I know I am asking a lot of questions."

19:46:43 Eli Grey says, "They never respond though."

19:46:52 Eli says to Vernos, "Asking questions is fantastic."

19:46:55 Melinda Michaels says, "They didn't respond but hopefully it was reported."

19:46:55 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

19:46:58 Eli Grey says, "Way better than acting without them."

19:47:20 Melinda Michaels says, "Morris and I tried to get the last ship to just leave and not fire upon it. But, it kept hitting us so we had to."

19:49:00 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly I think the IFS might be the best chance at finding the Jinu."

19:49:17 Vernos Bailey says, "No offense to anyone here."

19:50:07 Melinda Michaels says, "I think they'd be good allies against the outsiders. I am not sure how much help they'd be with the Jinu."

19:50:31 Vernos Bailey asks, "Extra ships to help us get the lowell out of drydock?"

19:50:44 Melinda Michaels says, "You are missing the point here."

19:50:57 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

19:51:03 Melinda Michaels says, "We can't go in with the Lowell until we find a way to hide it's signature."

19:51:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Once we find a way to hide the signature, we can launch undetected and go."

19:52:13 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

19:52:23 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

19:52:32 Vernos Bailey asks, "Know what I like about conversations of speculation?"

19:52:43 Melinda Michaels asks, "What's that?"

19:52:47 Vernos Bailey says, "As long as no one gets offended they can go on forever and pass a lot of time."

19:52:52 Melinda Michaels says, "Sure."

19:53:09 Vernos Bailey says, "Plus you never know what ideas might come of it."

19:53:19 Melinda Michaels says, "The ideas are good, we just don't need the Lowell detected at all. They will fuck us up if they figure out that ship is on the hunt."

19:53:43 Vernos Bailey says, "Oh yeah I have no doubt at all."

19:53:49 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

19:53:56 Vernos Bailey says, "Mothership at every planet."

19:55:17 Vernos says to Pierre-Louis, "I do not even need to be on the team to help go find the Jinu. I just want to be a pilot when it occurs."

19:55:55 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

19:56:35 Aisling the Fox says, "Well, do not retire."

19:56:53 Aisling the Fox says, "Might happen sometime in several trade cycles. Maybe."

19:57:58 Aisling the Fox says, "I missed four planets. Very sad."

19:58:06 Lily frowns in the direction of the Rift Drive displays.

19:58:46 Aisling the Fox asks, "How far does Nissi wish to let charge get down to before using furnace?"

19:58:47 Eli Grey says, "Might be good to wait until they've learned all they can from the captured Mothership too. Will likely be something useful in there."

19:59:05 Melinda says to Aisling, "We'll be stopping at the next place or a couple percent."

19:59:06 Aisling the Fox says, "We have about two cycles remaining."

19:59:07 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I would say we're getting there!"

19:59:10 Lily Kaise laughs.

19:59:14 Eli Grey says, "Although,  I think it's been a long time since they made any progress."

19:59:17 Aisling the Fox nods to Melinda Michaels.

19:59:57 Vernos Bailey says, "General feeling I got was that it took them a really long time to get where they just got."

20:00:08 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

20:00:13 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

20:00:13 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

20:00:39 Vernos Bailey says, "I do not know exactly how long though."

20:01:19 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

20:01:22 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

20:01:31 Melinda Michaels says, "We are down to 6% and the drive does not need repaired."

20:01:58 Vernos Bailey says, "6% is where I believe I will start getting antsy."

20:02:53 Eli Grey says, "I'm sure there's already some fuel in the furnace, we'll be fine even if we don't find a spot to get more."

20:03:00 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

20:03:33 Eli says to Vernos, "But yeah It's kinda scary isn't it? Seeing it that low when we're this far out?"

20:03:52 Vernos Bailey says, "Not scary, I trust the pilots around me."

20:03:56 Eli Grey nods to Vernos Bailey.

20:03:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Just concerning."

20:04:20 Eli Grey says, "I guess I meant scary more in an exciting, like the way a roller coaster can be scary heh."

20:04:30 Vernos Bailey says, "Oh."

20:04:31 Eli Grey says, "Since we know it will all be fine."

20:04:33 Eli Grey grins at Vernos Bailey.

20:04:39 Vernos thinks for a moment then nods.

20:04:51 Lily Kaise says, "Well we have fuel in the furnace and in the hold so we're good down to the very last gasp of charge."

20:04:55 Lily Kaise grins.

20:04:55 Aisling the Fox says, "We are good."

20:05:08 Aisling the Fox says, "Six percent charge on this ship is still two cycles."

20:05:17 Lily Kaise says, "Will just require a lot of shoveling."

20:05:20 Eli Grey says, "We'll just hook up Invocation to the battery."

20:05:23 Vernos Bailey says, "Nissi is going to wake up again and say quit worrying abot charge."

20:05:24 Eli whistles innocently.

20:05:24 Vernos Bailey laughs.

20:05:28 Aisling the Fox nods.

20:05:29 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yup she would!"

20:05:55 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

20:06:00 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

20:06:12 Vernos Bailey asks, "Uh?"

20:06:14 Lily Kaise says, "Unless we find some mighty charging station out here, I suppose we have a couple of days before we have to turn back."

20:06:29 Vernos Bailey asks, "That noise is okay, right?"

20:06:30 Eli Grey says, "Ugh.. speed's gonna get slower."

20:06:33 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

20:06:34 Melinda Michaels says, "It's fine."

20:06:54 Vernos Bailey nods.

20:07:10 Eli Grey says, "Slower is not always so bad, more time for sensors to scan for points of interest."

20:07:27 Eli Grey says, "Now that we're way out here already."

20:11:37 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

20:11:55 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

20:14:05 Eli glances at Lily, Vernos, and then Ather.

20:14:16 Eli Grey asks, "Are all our liaisons except Kim here?"

20:14:23 Lily Kaise says, "I'm not one."

20:14:27 Lily Kaise grins at Eli Grey.

20:14:27 Eli Grey says, "Oh."

20:14:31 Lily Kaise says, "Shule is."

20:14:36 Eli Grey says, "Oh but he's here too."

20:14:37 Eli Grey nods.

20:14:41 Lily Kaise pats you on the back.

20:14:44 Lily Kaise nods.

20:14:46 Eli Grey grins at you.

20:15:33 Lily Kaise says, "Awesome not to be tied to a rift loc."

20:15:37 Vernos Bailey removes spacesuit components from a standard starship flightbag and quickly dons them.

20:15:40 Vernos Bailey removes a plain white spacesuit helmet from his head.

20:15:40 Lily Kaise squints.

20:16:01 Eli says to Lily, "What do you mean?"

20:16:02 Vernos Bailey says, "All it prepration."

20:16:13 Vernos Bailey says, "Call it I mean."

20:16:14 Lily says to Eli, "Sometimes I just don't know..."

20:16:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:16:21 Eli Grey smirks.

20:16:25 Eli Grey says, "I know how that feels."

20:17:02 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

20:18:34 Aisling says to Eli, "If it makes you feel better, entire active roster of Ninth Fleet is here."

20:19:07 Aisling the Fox says, "Have not seen Alysara in many many cycles, so I am not including her."

20:19:11 Aisling the Fox glances at Ather Jammoa.

20:19:14 Eli glances at Pierre-Louis, Anfisa of Marzore, and then Aisling.

20:19:18 Eli Grey nods.

20:19:22 Aisling the Fox says, "Cheri is here too."

20:19:25 Eli Grey says, "Oh,  right."

20:19:30 Eli Grey nods.

20:19:40 Aisling the Fox says, "And Sparks is well. Sparks is Sparks."

20:19:51 Eli Grey asks, "Erm... Sparks?"

20:19:54 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

20:20:02 Aisling the Fox says, "He is custom something or other."

20:20:09 Eli Grey asks, "Sparks magee?"

20:20:09 Aisling the Fox says, "Blah blah custom custom."

20:20:11 Lily Kaise says, "Yes that uniquely created pilot or such."

20:20:26 Aisling the Fox says, "Him and I do not get along."

20:20:30 Eli Grey furrows his brow.

20:20:33 Aisling the Fox says, "Alas. I am heart broken."

20:21:11 Aisling the Fox says, "Dylan Sparks. I have only spoken to him few times."

20:21:19 Eli Grey asks, "He's here?"

20:21:21 Aisling the Fox says, "But it was argument each time."

20:21:25 Aisling the Fox says, "No."

20:21:27 Eli Grey says, "I haven't seen him the whole trip I don't think."

20:21:28 Eli Grey says, "Oh."

20:21:31 Eli Grey says, "I misunderstood."

20:21:38 Aisling the Fox says, "Sorry. I have trouble with that."

20:21:58 Aisling the Fox says, "Ah, conveying clear point."

20:21:59 Eli Grey grins at Aisling the Fox.

20:22:00 Aisling the Fox nods.

20:22:14 Eli Grey asks, "You mean like trying to sell a children compressor?"

20:22:19 Eli Grey chuckles.

20:22:26 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

20:22:39 Aisling the Fox says, "Now now, I said do not put children in compressor."

20:22:51 Aisling the Fox says, "It was cautionary message."

20:22:53 Eli Grey grins.

20:23:55 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

20:24:47 Eli Grey says, "So, while we're on the subject of other pilots, I have a question."

20:25:05 Aisling the Fox says, "I may have obtuse answer."

20:25:11 Eli Grey asks, "I asked this last night, but would like to ask again now that more are awake, anyone in particular that I should not take on an expidition?"

20:25:21 Aisling the Fox says, "Sol."

20:25:25 Eli Grey laughs.

20:25:31 Eli says to Aisling, "That's what Morris said."

20:25:33 Vernos Bailey says, "Vernos."

20:25:37 Vernos Bailey snickers.

20:25:39 Eli Grey laughs at Vernos Bailey.

20:25:57 Vernos Bailey says, "I want to go on any expedition anyone is willing to invite me on honestly."

20:26:07 Melinda Michaels says, "Rogue pilots and any other names I give would be because of personal reasons. So, I won't do that."

20:26:09 Eli says to Vernos, "I was asking for people I should exclude though."

20:26:28 Eli Grey nods to Melinda Michaels.

20:26:45 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, only one rogue allowed on the expidition."

20:26:49 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:27:15 Lily says to Eli, "Obviously for us as many AEU who are interested and fit to travel."

20:27:20 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

20:27:21 Lily Kaise says, "Should go."

20:27:24 Eli Grey says, "Absolutely."

20:27:35 Aisling the Fox asks, "Well, does not AEU look down on these things now?"

20:27:50 Eli says to Aisling, "The government, the individuals, not so much."

20:28:00 Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

20:28:02 Lily Kaise says, "Not us who are pilots."

20:28:03 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

20:28:27 Aisling the Fox asks, "I suppose I mean was there not some warning about going out?"

20:28:39 Aisling the Fox says, "Possible aiding of unregistered peoples needing to be reported I think."

20:28:45 Eli Grey says, "Well, if anyone hears me about to take someone that I should know something about, please share any warnings you might have."

20:28:50 Aisling the Fox says, "Tricky tricky thing."

20:28:54 Eli says to Aisling, "I don't think I've heard anything about that."

20:29:13 Eli Grey asks, "What's she talkin about Union folks?"

20:29:15 Lily Kaise says, "There are perhaps a couple of AEU pilots who aren't fond of exploration but for the greater majority of us, that is one of the major reasons why we became pilots."

20:29:38 Vernos Bailey says, "Its just time to act on it instead of talking about it."

20:29:50 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

20:30:00 Melinda says to Eli, "You'd need to ask Kim more about that. But there was some message about not trading with or aiding pilots that weren't allied."

20:30:10 Morris Corlew asks, "Anybody get all pissy while we were at the final rage?"

20:30:10 Aisling the Fox nods to Melinda Michaels.

20:30:11 Eli nods a greeting at Morris.

20:30:14 Morris Corlew waves.

20:30:20 Vernos Bailey waves to Morris Corlew.

20:30:21 Morris Corlew grins.

20:30:25 Aisling says to Morris, "I did. For not seeing it."

20:30:25 Morris Corlew says, "Howdy, folks."

20:30:28 Aisling the Fox says, "Rrrrrr."

20:30:31 Morris Corlew gasps at Aisling the Fox.

20:30:33 Morris Corlew grins.

20:30:34 Morris Corlew lopes east.

20:30:38 Eli Grey groans while looking at Melinda Michaels.

20:30:45 Morris Corlew lopes in from the east.

20:30:48 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:30:51 Morris Corlew twists the bottom of a closed cup of beef-flavored noodles upward, activating the internal self-heating mechanism.

20:31:01 Eli says to Aisling, "Well that certainly makes things trickier."

20:31:01 The bottom of a closed cup of beef-flavored noodles pops back out as its self-heating is completed.

20:31:26 Aisling the Fox asks, "AEU must be careful about this. Government really does not see benefit of pilots doing exploration things. Is that not acting against interest of government and possible making you rogue?"

20:31:27 Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

20:31:31 Vernos Bailey says, "Well honestly I think Best considers the Mutuality as unregistered."

20:31:34 Eli Grey says, "Guess I should probably be keeping more quiet about trading at Andy's and tom Town."

20:31:42 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not know fine details of your special pilot agreement you make."

20:31:45 Lily Kaise says, "Doubt it."

20:31:50 Morris Corlew says to Vernos, "They are."

20:31:54 Melinda says to Lily, "I don't doubt it."

20:32:04 Melinda Michaels says, "They said pilots who weren't allied."

20:32:15 Melinda Michaels says, "Kim never clarified what that meant."

20:32:26 Eli Grey frowns.

20:32:29 Morris Corlew says, "They wouldn't give her clarification."

20:32:32 Aisling the Fox says, "We certainly are not allied."

20:32:34 Lily Kaise says, "I would really like to see the exact language of what Kim read as she um doesn't always relate exactly."

20:32:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Ask her for a transcript."

20:32:53 Eli Grey asks, "Get.. rogued? For exploring?"

20:32:54 Lily Kaise nods.

20:33:05 Aisling says to Eli, "Not in interest of government."

20:33:18 Vernos says to Aisling, "Honestly our government will only see benefit of exploring if something of importance gets brought back."

20:33:21 Eli's face becomes very stern.

20:33:31 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

20:33:39 Aisling the Fox says, "I thought that was what rogue meant for you all."

20:33:48 Aisling the Fox says, "Doing things government does not like you doing."

20:33:54 Eli Grey nods to Aisling the Fox.

20:34:13 Aisling the Fox giggles. "Well, exploring is really not what your government wants you doing."

20:34:17 Eli Grey says, "I just hadn't heard about this particular part until now."

20:34:19 Vernos Bailey says, "The thing is, they would have to rogue the entire corps."

20:34:25 Aisling the Fox looks at Vernos Bailey and shrugs.

20:34:26 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

20:34:27 Vernos Bailey says, "If we all decided to explore."

20:34:31 Aisling the Fox says, "They were ready to get rid of entire corps."

20:34:37 Aisling the Fox says, "Until Best came along."

20:34:41 Aisling the Fox asks, "What is point?"

20:34:45 Vernos Bailey says, "Best is idiot."

20:34:53 Vernos Bailey says, "And I will say that while I can."

20:34:54 Eli says to Aisling, "You know, I keep hearing that, but that's not how I took what Gardner said."

20:35:03 Melinda Michaels says, "He was gonna close it down."

20:35:14 Aisling the Fox says, "So was other lady."

20:35:18 Aisling the Fox says, "Not as quickly."

20:35:20 Melinda Michaels nods.

20:35:32 Aisling the Fox says, "Phase out after alternatives came up. But Garner was going to shut down."

20:35:33 "Rebane wanted to privatise." Morris Corlew nods. "Garner wanted to shut the whole thing down. No more corps period."

20:35:40 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

20:35:40 Emily Ford stretches.

20:35:41 Eli Grey says, "Was he? Because he sounded like he said that it could only be left to it's own self-destruction, which is still something that we pilots can pull ourselves out of."

20:35:44 Lily Kaise says, "Yep Garner was going to get rid of the Pilot Corps no doubt and the other wanted to privatize and privitazation is about as bad as what Garner wanted to do."

20:35:48 Aisling the Fox knocks on Emily Ford's head.

20:35:52 Aisling the Fox says, "Bonk."

20:35:52 Emily Ford says, "Bonk."

20:35:55 Melinda Michaels nods to Lily Kaise.

20:35:56 Aisling the Fox beams.

20:35:57 Emily Ford knocks on Aisling the Fox's head.

20:36:14 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly I'll get rogued for exploration."

20:36:22 Lily Kaise says, "I would too."

20:36:31 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:36:44 Vernos Bailey says, "It would be taking a stand."

20:36:48 Aisling says to Vernos, "Some restrictions do apply. May not be acceptable in all sectors. See government for more details."

20:36:49 Vernos Bailey says, "In my eyes."

20:37:05 Eli Grey says, "I wish I could hear this stuff myyself. The only thing I heard was the stuff on ISN."

20:37:14 Eli Grey says, "Which doesn't seem to be exactly what you guys are saying."

20:37:17 Eli Grey shrugs.

20:37:18 Vernos says to Aisling, "Oh I am sure it would be terrible."

20:37:30 Vernos Bailey says, "But I'd get rogued to take a stand."

20:37:39 Lily Kaise says, "Well the others would have to ban us but just taking a stand means no harm towards other agreements with other alliances in this instance."

20:37:56 Emily shakes her head, "I doubt you'll get rogued for exploring, you're earning them money for their military projects."

20:38:04 Lily Kaise says, "Seriously we are."

20:38:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly I'd like to see another EAOS coup."

20:38:28 Morris Corlew says, "I'm with Emily here."

20:38:28 Vernos Bailey says, "But I did not say that."

20:38:30 Eli Grey says, "They haven't shut down the Xenology cetners, or the Stellar Cartography branch so that's a good sign."

20:38:31 Morris Corlew blinks at Vernos Bailey.

20:38:33 Aisling the Fox says, "You just did."

20:38:41 Aisling the Fox says, "That is some stern wording."

20:38:47 Morris says to Vernos, "That, I think, would be more likely to get you rogued than exploring."

20:38:49 Lily Kaise says, "Well that wouldn't stop us from going to others."

20:38:49 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

20:39:07 Emily Ford says, "Best will shove him in prison for such treason."

20:39:11 Emily Ford nods to Vernos Bailey.

20:39:13 Aisling the Fox says, "Even I am not fond of EAOS coup. Best may be idiot, but he is your idiot. People elected him."

20:39:18 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, I'd love it if the EAOS would revive the liaison program."

20:39:30 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

20:39:35 Aisling the Fox says, "EAOS has no business telling you who should be your leader. That is your choice."

20:39:40 Morris says to a Tardick lizard named Raissa, "Good waking cycle Madam Raissa."

20:39:42 Morris Corlew strokes a Tardick lizard named Raissa's warm scaly skin.

20:39:47 Melinda Michaels says, "You can't depend on ohters to save your alliance just to keep your jobs. You gotta do something about it yourselves."

20:39:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Hey as long as private opinion is not shared with public while out of comms why not state it."

20:39:56 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

20:39:56 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

20:40:01 Vernos Bailey says, "I only get in trouble if you share it."

20:40:37 Morris says sternly to Vernos, "Don't count on folks not to share things. If someone things what you say is dangerous, I doubt they'll hold their tongue."

20:40:57 Vernos says to Melinda, "Honestly I would one hundred percent get rogued if it meant taking a stand on something I believe is good for the alliance."

20:41:03 Emily raises an eyebrow then asks to Vernos, "You do realize that it only takes one argument for someone to open their mouth. After that, it would be up to you to lie to cover yourself?"

20:41:59 Vernos Bailey says, "I've said what I said, and I can not take that back."

20:42:09 Vernos Bailey says, "I would have to just live with the conquences."

20:42:38 Emily Ford says, "It's fine to believe in something, though it sounds as if you're goin to the extreme for a solution before you've explored any other method."

20:42:48 Morris Corlew nods.

20:43:18 Eli says to Vernos, "Start with doing the hair thing that Rogue said last night."

20:43:20 Eli Grey grins.

20:43:25 Vernos Bailey says, "No the method I want to explore the most."

20:43:26 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

20:43:32 Emily Ford says, "One second."

20:43:34 Emily Ford stands up from a white leather sofa.

20:43:34 Emily Ford slinks south.

20:43:37 You faintly hear Emily Ford's voice on the external PA saying, "Any chance you could like, swing around and give us a shove from behind? Thanks my old friend"

20:43:42 Luja perks up.

20:43:42 Emily Ford slinks in from the south.

20:43:45 Emily Ford sits down on a white leather sofa.

20:43:46 Vernos Bailey says, "Is just standing up for the fact I believe exploration is good for the alliance."

20:43:48 Luja says to Morris, "Hey, Morris?"

20:43:48 Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.

20:43:51 Eli says to Morris, "She said he should have AEU hair."

20:43:55 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

20:43:56 Morris says to Luja, "Yeah?"

20:43:57 Eli Grey smiles at Emily Ford.

20:44:00 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

20:44:14 Luja Garland asks, "What was the name of your fighter again? Bull in a China Workshop?"

20:44:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Well tell you what."

20:44:21 Luja Garland says, "No, wait."

20:44:23 Morris says to Eli, "Ah. I gave him paint for full on League hair and said he could see what it was like to shun his lasers."

20:44:25 Morris Corlew grins.

20:44:29 Luja Garland asks, "Angry Bull In A China Shop?"

20:44:31 Vernos Bailey says, "I said it, I will not repeat it ever again."

20:44:40 Morris says to Luja, "Bull In A China Shop."

20:44:41 Eli Grey exclaims, "Don't take away my lazy beams!"

20:44:50 Morris Corlew laughs at Eli Grey.

20:44:55 Morris says to Eli, "You got it right though."

20:44:56 Morris Corlew chuckles.

20:45:08 Luja Garland asks, "Bull In A China Shop. Nice. Did it have those really fast chains on it?"

20:45:15 Aisling the Fox asks, "What is a China shop?"

20:45:17 Morris says to Luja, "It does."

20:45:26 Luja grins toothily. "Awesome."

20:45:42 Morris says to Aisling, "A shop where they sell fine dishes that ain't good for much than fancy eatin once in a blue moon or decoration...or to show ya got credits."

20:45:44 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

20:45:51 Eli says to Aisling, "A hole shop for nothing but plates and cups."

20:45:55 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh. So that's why the bowl is there."

20:46:03 Aisling the Fox says, "Makes sense now."

20:46:05 Morris Corlew looks at Aisling the Fox thoughtfully.

20:46:08 Morris Corlew asks, "The bowl?"

20:46:10 Emily Ford says to Aisling, "It refers to a store where they sell fragile items of all types."

20:46:12 Eli Grey grins.

20:46:12 Lily Kaise says, "And a fancy figurine or two."

20:46:24 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise and nods to Emily Ford. "True."

20:46:29 Eli Grey says, "Bull is big four legged animal, very aggressive."

20:46:30 Emily Ford says, "And a bull is an animal known for charging around."

20:46:35 Morris Corlew says, "Anyway, fancy breakable, expensive stuff."

20:46:38 Morris Corlew nods.

20:46:53 Morris Corlew says, "So...basically it'd be disastrous for a bull to be in a china shop."

20:46:58 Morris Corlew says, "It'd break everything."

20:47:00 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh, but a bowl is thing you eat out of. Soup and such. That would be in shop that sells those things."

20:47:08 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox.

20:47:08 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Or a bonzai squirrel!"

20:47:11 Morris Corlew says, "It would."

20:47:11 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:47:14 Eli Grey points at Aisling the Fox.

20:47:15 Aisling the Fox asks, "Why would you put a large mean animal in shop?"

20:47:18 Eli Grey says, "I almost like her version better."

20:47:26 Luja Garland grins at Aisling the Fox.

20:47:27 Eli Grey says, "Yep, time to sit here like a bowl in a china shop."

20:47:28 Morris says to Aisling, "It'd wander in more likely."

20:47:30 Emily Ford says, "A bowl in a china shop wouldn't be at all out of place. A bull on the other hand..."

20:47:35 Aisling the Fox looks at Morris Corlew thoughtfully.

20:47:43 Lily Kaise says, "You probably wouldn't deliberatly but some humans are similarly prone to such behavior."

20:47:43 Aisling the Fox asks, "How?"

20:47:44 Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.

20:47:45 Luja Garland says, "I just think it's such as fitting name for that fighter."

20:47:59 Aisling the Fox asks, "Do these animals need bowls?"

20:48:02 Morris says to Aisling, "Through the door. Bulls can...rampage. get angry and run around like they're crazy."

20:48:04 Aisling the Fox asks, "Like felo?"

20:48:04 Lily Kaise says, "Wapecially toddlers and young children."

20:48:09 Lily Kaise says, "Especially that is."

20:48:10 Morris says to Aisling, "No."

20:48:11 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:48:11 Emily Ford says, "No, although they do need balls."

20:48:15 Morris Corlew laughs at Emily Ford.

20:48:20 Luja Garland snickers.

20:48:23 Emily Ford says, "Ducks have bills."

20:48:26 Aisling the Fox says, "Felo play with balls."

20:48:28 A Tardick lizard named Raissa settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

20:48:28 Emily Ford says, "And doors have bells."

20:48:37 Morris says to Emily, "Not all."

20:48:41 Eli says to Aisling, "I guess it would have really thrown you off if someone had said "grab the bowl by the horns""

20:48:59 Aisling the Fox says, "Bowls do not have horns."

20:48:59 Morris shakes in silent laughter, then glances apologetically at Aisling.

20:49:26 Morris says to Aisling, "The point is, it's a wreckless animal in a place where many expensive things would be broken."

20:49:33 Aisling the Fox says, "Your language is infuriating sometimes."

20:49:38 Eli Grey cackles!

20:49:42 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox. "Indeed."

20:49:43 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:49:44 Lily Kaise glides south.

20:49:47 Eli says to Aisling, "Your wisdom knows no bounds Aisling."

20:49:48 Vernos Bailey says, "What they are saying is I really need to watch what I say."

20:49:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Which is true."

20:50:02 Aisling the Fox points at Vernos Bailey.

20:50:05 Aisling the Fox says, "Like that."

20:50:10 Aisling the Fox says, "Watch what you say."

20:50:11 Luja Garland asks, "Morris, do you remember if I did a beacon in your fighter?"

20:50:15 Aisling the Fox says, "You cannot watch what you say."

20:50:17 Luja Garland asks, "And not just in a scout with you?"

20:50:19 Morris says to Luja, "Nah."

20:50:21 Eli Grey grins.

20:50:28 Morris says to Luja, "Just in the vette I think."

20:50:34 Aisling the Fox says, "I mean, unless you are looking in mirror while you talk. Maybe then."

20:50:42 Vernos Bailey chuckles.

20:50:46 Luja Garland says, "Ah, thanks."

20:50:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Sorry, Aisling."

20:51:07 Emily Ford says, "One fine day in the middle of the night."

20:51:13 Emily Ford says, "Two dead men got up to fight."

20:51:18 Aisling the Fox looks at Emily Ford thoughtfully.

20:51:21 Emily Ford says, "Back to back they faced each other."

20:51:29 Emily Ford says, "Drew their swords and shot each other."

20:51:30 Emily Ford nods.

20:51:31 Morris Corlew says, "Oh! I remember this one."

20:51:34 Morris Corlew grins.

20:51:42 Morris says to Emily, "Been a long time since I heard that."

20:51:50 Aisling the Fox says, "I cannot even..."

20:51:53 Aisling rubs her head.

20:51:53 Emily Ford says, "Dear ladles and jellyspoons."

20:51:54 Morris Corlew grins.

20:51:55 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

20:52:04 Emily Ford says, "I come before you, to stand behind you."

20:52:06 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

20:52:12 Lily Kaise puts a semi-transparent egg on a maple coffee table.

20:52:13 Emily Ford says, "To tell you something I know nothing about."

20:52:29 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:52:33 Vernos Bailey asks, "Another egg?"

20:52:33 Emily Ford says, "One summers night in winter, the rain was snowing fast."

20:52:40 Eli Grey says, "Maybe with oscilloscope we could watch what we say."

20:52:42 Eli Grey grins.

20:52:48 Emily Ford says, "A bare footed man with shoes on, stood sitting in the grass."

20:53:00 Emily Ford nods.

20:53:10 Vernos says to Emily, "Now you are confusing me."

20:53:12 Emily Ford says, "Those are the only ones I know."

20:53:17 Morris Corlew grins at Vernos Bailey. "That's the point."

20:53:30 Vernos says to Morris, "I followed most of it."

20:53:34 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "There's another."

20:53:39 Morris Corlew says, "Tryin to remember how it goes."

20:53:56 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

20:53:56 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

20:54:13 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

20:54:14 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

20:54:24 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

20:54:30 Eli squints.

20:54:35 Vernos Bailey says, "1.GOA left."

20:54:40 Eli Grey removes a pair of black kamina shades from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

20:54:42 Eli Grey puts on a pair of black kamina shades.

20:55:01 Emily Ford says, "We've got enough in the hold to get us to some random point of interest."

20:55:10 Lily Kaise says, "The new egg on the table has a bell-shaped embryo and is fuchsia."

20:55:25 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

20:55:38 Morris Corlew says, "One tall midget reached up high."

20:55:43 Morris Corlew says, "Touched the ground above the sky."

20:55:51 Morris Corlew says, "Tied his loafers, licked his tongue."

20:55:58 Morris Corlew says, "And told about the bee he stung."

20:56:07 Morris Corlew says, "He painted then, an oval square."

20:56:12 Vernos says to Emily, "Anyways, my stupidity aside. I doubt they will rogue up for exploring but if they did I would accept it and say I took a stand."

20:56:15 Morris Corlew says, "The color of the bald man's hair."

20:56:22 Morris Corlew says, "And in the painting you could hear."

20:56:24 Vernos Bailey says, "Us I mean."

20:56:29 Morris Corlew says, "What's undetected by the ear."

20:56:32 Morris Corlew applauds sedately.

20:56:52 Morris says to Aisling, "Confused enough?"

20:56:57 Emily Ford grins at Morris Corlew.

20:56:59 Aisling the Fox says, "I stopped listening."

20:57:09 Vernos says to Aisling, "You too?"

20:57:11 Emily says to Aisling, "It's not meant to make sense."

20:57:20 Morris Corlew gasps at Aisling the Fox.

20:57:28 Morris Corlew shakes his head. "It's not."

20:57:30 Emily says to Aisling, "That's treason."

20:57:33 Morris Corlew says, "It's pure silliness."

20:57:43 Aisling the Fox asks, "What is treason?"

20:57:49 Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

20:58:00 Morris says to Aisling, "You not listenin."

20:58:04 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh."

20:58:10 Aisling the Fox asks, "What?"

20:58:20 Emily Ford says, "Going against your government. In this case you're against your shipmates spirit of... something."

20:58:32 Morris Corlew says, "'I see' said the blind man to his deaf and dumb daughter, as he picked up his hammer and saw."

20:58:40 Aisling the Fox says, "Mutuality does not really care too much about your silliness I think."

20:58:41 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

20:58:46 Emily Ford sighs.

20:58:49 Aisling the Fox knocks on Emily Ford's head.

20:58:51 Aisling the Fox says, "Bonk."

20:58:53 Morris says to Aisling, "We care. It's fun."

20:59:03 Aisling the Fox says, "My silliness, though, is other story."

20:59:04 Emily says to Aisling, "No, not at all. It's as far from bonk as you can get now."

20:59:23 Emily folds her arms and simply stares at Aisling.

20:59:28 Aisling the Fox beams.

21:00:17 Aisling the Fox removes an orange sonic ship cleanliness enforcer from a tyrian purple scorched metal thigh holster.

21:00:20 Aisling the Fox aims an orange sonic ship cleanliness enforcer at Emily Ford's head and pulls the trigger. A barely audible high-pitched whine fills the room as she sweeps it across Emily Ford's body. A fine accumulation of grime surrounds the area around Emily Ford's feet before Aisling the Fox turns off the machine.

21:00:24 Aisling the Fox says, "Be clean."

21:00:35 Aisling the Fox puts an orange sonic ship cleanliness enforcer in a tyrian purple scorched metal thigh holster.

21:00:44 Eli Grey says, "Shower gun is the best."

21:00:55 Eli Grey removes a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

21:01:01 Eli Grey aims a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer at his own head and pulls the trigger. A barely audible high-pitched whine fills the room as he sweeps it across his body. A fine accumulation of grime surrounds the area around Eli Grey's feet before his turns off the machine.

21:01:20 Eli Grey deftly inserts a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer into a charcoal gray leather gadget bag with lightning speed.

21:01:40 Vernos says to Eli, "So is your trip not going to happen?"

21:01:48 Eli Grey raises an eyebrow at Vernos Bailey.

21:01:54 Lily Kaise blinks.

21:01:55 Eli Grey asks, "What makes you think that?"

21:02:09 Vernos Bailey says, "If Best is not wanting us to explore."

21:02:14 Vernos Bailey asks, "Or are you going to anyways?"

21:02:16 Emily Ford stares at Aisling the Fox.

21:02:30 Emily says to Aisling, "What about my battle marks? I was treasuring those."

21:02:31 Eli Grey says, "Well, from what I've heard in this conversation, he mostly just doesn't want us trading with non allied folks."

21:02:48 Vernos Bailey says, "Hm."

21:02:50 Eli Grey says, "That's the only thing I heard as far as any kind of official decree. I know he's stated he doesn't like it but still."

21:02:52 Aisling the Fox says, "Get new ones."

21:03:01 Morris Corlew says, "Wonder if that would preclude Aisling getting things crafted by Ather."

21:03:03 Aisling the Fox says, "More treasure."

21:03:14 Lily Kaise says, "Just because he shut down the Explorer's Corps which really never occurred anyway, that has nothing to do with what we do."

21:03:26 Eli Grey says, "I'll still be making a trip for sure."

21:03:27 Aisling says to Morris, "Not sure. He has not stopped making things for me though."

21:03:35 Aisling the Fox pokes Ather Jammoa in the ribs!

21:03:39 Aisling the Fox removes a stylized leaping fox stamp from a worn and tattered brown leather satchel.

21:03:47 Aisling the Fox quickly reaches out and stamps Ather Jammoa with a stylized leaping fox stamp, leaving him slightly marked-up but otherwise uninjured.

21:03:51 Aisling the Fox puts a stylized leaping fox stamp in a worn and tattered brown leather satchel.

21:03:57 Aisling the Fox says, "You have been foxed."

21:04:01 Eli Grey laughs.

21:04:03 Vernos Bailey laughs.

21:04:18 Eli Grey says, "Www, I need a dragonfly one."

21:04:20 Eli Grey chuckles.

21:04:56 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

21:05:49 Eli Grey removes a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

21:05:59 Vernos Bailey says, "To be honest, I want at least a non aggression pact with the mutuality some day."

21:06:05 Aisling the Fox laughs.

21:06:15 Aisling the Fox points at Ather Jammoa.

21:06:22 Eli puts the end of a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer in his mouth and pulls the trigger. The device emits a high pitched whine and eli's cheeks flap comically.

21:06:28 Aisling the Fox says, "Talk to him."

21:06:37 Eli Grey says, "Woo, that'll wake you up."

21:06:40 Eli Grey puts a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

21:06:47 Morris says to Eli, "That didn't look too pleasant."

21:06:49 Vernos says to Aisling, "One day I shall."

21:07:08 Aisling the Fox says, "Then good luck with Council ever agreeing to that with your current president."

21:07:13 Eli says to Morris, "It doesn't, but mouth is now super clean."

21:07:21 Aisling the Fox says, "Was dream even with last one."

21:07:22 Morris Corlew looks at Eli Grey thoughtfully.

21:07:24 Eli grins broadly.

21:07:44 Vernos says to Aisling, "I was under the impression that the council rather just deal with the pilots."

21:08:36 Aisling the Fox says, "The Council does not hold AEU in high regard."

21:08:54 Vernos Bailey says, "Of that I do not blame them."

21:08:54 Aisling the Fox says, "As much as I know."

21:09:07 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, but both sides still bheave as though the pact stands for the most part. At least from what I've seen."

21:09:11 Eli Grey shrugs.

21:09:14 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

21:09:20 Aisling the Fox says, "Landing rights."

21:09:24 Aisling the Fox says, "That is all."

21:09:33 Aisling the Fox says, "I cannot even transfer debris at AEU port."

21:09:43 Aisling the Fox says, "So no, it is not like pact. At all."

21:09:43 Eli Grey frowns.

21:09:57 Emily says to Aisling, "That's okay, AEU credits are substandard anyway."

21:10:02 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

21:10:03 Aisling the Fox grins at Emily Ford.

21:10:28 Eli Grey says, "Hmm I just assumed since I was still allowed to land at Mutuality ports that you were allowed to land at ours, but I guess that makes sense. We don't have the Free Port Doctrine after all."

21:10:30 Vernos Bailey says, "Well perhaps if the corps asks nicely, terms could be discussed."

21:10:57 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

21:11:04 Vernos Bailey says, "I do believe in optimism."

21:11:21 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

21:11:38 Emily Ford asks, "Optimism?"

21:11:52 Aisling says to Eli, "It basically amounts to Doctrine."

21:11:52 Lily Kaise says, "Ah k."
Morris Corlew says, "Diplomacy is more than a couple of the scumbags of society askin for somethin and then just gettin it."

21:11:53 Emily Ford says, "I think we've got a scan of that type built into the ship systems."

21:12:03 Vernos says to Emily, "You know that anything can have a postitive outcome."

21:12:06 Aisling the Fox says, "You can land at our ports, we can land at yours."

21:12:33 Aisling the Fox says, "I will be back later, anyway."

21:12:36 Aisling the Fox stands up from a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

21:12:39 Aisling the Fox says, "Going to lay down."

21:12:41 Aisling the Fox waves.

21:12:41 Eli Grey nods to Aisling the Fox.

21:12:42 Lily Kaise says, "You can still buy tings in both but we can't trade of transact anything of mutual commerce."

21:12:43 Eli Grey waves.

21:12:43 Vernos Bailey says, "Rest well."

21:12:45 Morris says to Aisling, "Rest well."

21:12:47 Lily Kaise waves.

21:12:48 Emily Ford says, "Bonk."

21:12:53 Aisling the Fox knocks on Emily Ford's head.

21:12:54 Aisling the Fox says, "Bonk."

21:12:54 Aisling the Fox prances south.

21:12:55 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

21:13:00 Emily Ford says into the PA microphone, "Bonk."

21:13:03 Vernos Bailey asks, "Did I say something wrong?"

21:13:22 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Doubt it, some have to go when they go!"

21:13:22 Vernos Bailey says, "By hoping for better relations one day."

21:13:29 Emily Ford turns on a purple metachannel FTL communicator.

21:13:44 Morris says to Vernos, "What, 'cause she went to lie down?"

21:13:50 Vernos Bailey nods.

21:13:57 Morris says to Vernos, "Folks gotta lie down when they're tired."

21:13:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Was just making sure I did not upset her."

21:16:07 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

21:16:51 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

21:17:00 Morris Corlew waves to Nissi Valdaire.

21:17:02 Nissi Valdaire glances around at her surroundings.

21:17:02 Nissi Valdaire walks east.

21:17:13 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the east.

21:17:13 Vernos Bailey waves to Nissi Valdaire.

21:17:15 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

21:17:17 Morris Corlew pulls the lid off a hot cup of beef-flavored noodles.

21:17:17 Nissi Valdaire carefully unwraps a turkey sandwich.

21:17:19 Nissi Valdaire picks up half of a turkey sandwich and takes a huge bite.

21:17:22 Morris Corlew retrieves a steaming forkful of pasta from a hot cup of beef-flavored noodles and pops it into his mouth.

21:17:47 Morris Corlew takes several bites of hot pasta from a hot cup of beef-flavored noodles.

21:17:50 Vernos says to Morris, "How is the beef? I have been sticking to the chicken or veggie flavored."

21:17:57 Morris says to Vernos, "It's fine."

21:18:01 Emily Ford smiles at Nissi Valdaire.

21:18:03 Morris Corlew looks down into a hot cup of beef-flavored noodles, retrieving more flavorful bites as he nears the bottom of the cup.

21:18:20 Morris Corlew finishes off a hot cup of beef-flavored noodles, leaving just a cup of heavily-flavored pasta water.

21:18:21 Emily says to Nissi Valdaire, "We've been out and polished up the hull captain."

21:18:27 Morris Corlew gives a foam cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

21:18:34 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

21:19:09 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Good!"

21:19:14 Nissi Valdaire takes another large bite of a turkey sandwich.

21:19:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Rub, rub."

21:19:51 Emily says to Pierre-Louis, "Is that you with your hand in your pocket again?"

21:19:55 Emily Ford giggles.

21:20:04 Morris says to Emily, "He's just happy to see ya."

21:20:06 Morris Corlew shrugs.

21:20:21 Emily eyes Morris warily.

21:20:26 Nissi Valdaire finishes off half of a turkey sandwich.

21:20:40 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

21:20:58 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

21:22:02 Emily Ford says, "Great chatting with you."

21:22:05 Emily Ford stands up from a white leather sofa.

21:22:06 Emily Ford slinks south.

21:22:17 Emily Ford slinks in from the south.

21:22:17 Emily Ford slinks east.

21:22:27 Emily Ford's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And I clearly need to learn where the galley is."

21:22:42 Vernos Bailey says into the PA microphone, "Did that twice when I first came aboard."

21:24:21 Emily Ford slinks in from the east.

21:24:23 Emily Ford sits down on a white leather sofa.

21:24:37 Nissi Valdaire starts in on the second half of a turkey sandwich.

21:25:10 Vernos Bailey strolls east.

21:25:20 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

21:25:38 Nissi Valdaire takes another large bite of a turkey sandwich.

21:25:40 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

21:25:57 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

21:26:01 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the east.

21:26:04 Vernos Bailey twists the bottom of a closed cup of chicken-flavored noodles upward, activating the internal self-heating mechanism.

21:26:13 The bottom of a closed cup of chicken-flavored noodles pops back out as its self-heating is completed.

21:26:15 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

21:26:23 Vernos Bailey pulls the lid off a hot cup of chicken-flavored noodles.

21:27:04 Vernos Bailey retrieves a steaming forkful of pasta from a hot cup of chicken-flavored noodles and pops it into his mouth.

21:30:25 Emily Ford chews her food slowly.

21:30:47 Morris Corlew finishes off a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

21:30:51 Vernos Bailey says, "Someone is hungry."

21:30:55 Morris Corlew gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

21:31:12 Emily Ford says, "I wonder where they get the beef, it's real good quality."

21:31:47 Vernos Bailey says, "Hm, good question."

21:31:56 Vernos Bailey looks down into a hot cup of chicken-flavored noodles, retrieving more flavorful bites as he nears the bottom of the cup.

21:32:13 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

21:32:13 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

21:32:19 Lily Kaise finishes off a mound of hot chicken-flavored rice in a small bowl.

21:32:37 Vernos Bailey says to Nissi, "This battery is insane."

21:32:42 Vernos Bailey says, "I love it."

21:32:47 Nissi Valdaire grins.

21:32:59 Nissi Valdaire finishes off the last of a turkey sandwich.

21:33:00 Emily Ford asks, "We have a battery?"

21:33:04 Nissi Valdaire gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

21:33:13 Vernos says to Emily, "You would never know."

21:33:16 Morris Corlew opens a slate blue leather gear bag.

21:33:19 Morris Corlew takes a small battery from Morris Corlew's workbench.

21:33:21 Vernos Bailey says, "The ship just keeps going and going."

21:33:23 Morris Corlew gives a small battery to Emily Ford.

21:33:29 Emily Ford says, "Wow..."

21:33:31 Emily Ford glances at Morris Corlew.

21:33:35 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:33:37 Emily Ford considers a small battery thoughtfully.

21:33:43 Lily Kaise says to Morris, "Think that will tide us over?"

21:33:47 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:33:49 Morris says to Lily, "Maybe."

21:33:50 Morris Corlew grins.

21:33:54 Emily Ford asks, "We've rifted all this way on one of these?"

21:34:05 Lily Kaise exclaims, "According to some!"

21:34:06 Morris says to Emily, "Not quite. Interesting thought though."

21:34:08 Vernos Bailey says, "I think we would need at least one more to make it home."

21:34:13 Morris Corlew laughs.

21:35:04 Vernos says to Morris, "At least two small batteries to power this ship."

21:35:05 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

21:35:16 Morris says to Vernos, "Would need a lot more than that."

21:35:56 Vernos says to Nissi, "Can we ride back in the bubble? I want to see the drain difference."

21:36:06 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:36:18 Vernos Bailey says, "Because this ship is awesome."

21:36:22 Morris says to Vernos, "It didn't effect drain when it was on before."

21:36:31 Vernos says to Morris, "Oh, I never looked."

21:36:37 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly."

21:36:39 Morris says to Vernos, "I think Goss did?"

21:36:40 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

21:36:45 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

21:36:45 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

21:36:58 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

21:37:00 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

21:37:07 Nissi Valdaire says, "Probably wanna recharge at the next thing."

21:37:14 Lily Kaise nods.

21:37:14 Emily says to Morris, "I'll give you this back in case I confuse it with my sandwich. You know how likely that is. I should have been born blond."

21:37:17 Vernos Bailey nods.

21:37:20 Morris Corlew laughs.

21:37:21 Emily Ford gives a small battery to Morris Corlew.

21:37:24 Emily Ford finishes off half of a roast beef sandwich.

21:37:24 Morris Corlew puts a small battery on Morris Corlew's workbench.

21:37:27 Morris Corlew snaps his fingers.

21:37:30 Morris Corlew lopes south.

21:37:53 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

21:37:55 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

21:38:03 Vernos says to Emily, "Would make for a crunchy sandwich."

21:38:26 Emily Ford says, "With a soft, acidic center. Yum."

21:38:41 Vernos Bailey says, "Just like Ather's soul."

21:38:43 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew shrugs. "Batteries ain't so bad."

21:38:44 Vernos Bailey smirks.

21:38:49 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew says, "And I'm...a huge liar."

21:38:50 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew chuckles.

21:38:56 Emily Ford looks at Ather Jammoa thoughtfully.

21:39:02 Emily Ford says, "Misunderstood."

21:39:04 Emily Ford nods.

21:39:15 Morris says to Emily, "Oh I thought he meant soft and acidic."

21:39:16 Morris "Alkaline Piles" Corlew chuckles.

21:39:37 Emily Ford says, "Hey, I've been known to be acidic, so I'm not going to comment."

21:39:41 Emily Ford starts in on the second half of a roast beef sandwich.

21:39:49 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

21:39:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We simply cannot recharge until we find thing worth sending extended observation programmed probe. Even if we must run out of charge and self-destruct ship for what will be considered very worse reason ever."

21:40:07 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly I just try not to upset folks or say stupid shit."

21:40:07 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

21:40:23 Eli Grey smirks at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

21:40:30 Morris Corlew grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

21:40:34 Emily says to Vernos, "When do you plan to implement that?"

21:40:37 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

21:40:47 Morris looks away and scratches his head.

21:40:57 Eli Grey stands up from a white leather sofa.

21:40:59 Eli Grey roams east.

21:41:02 Vernos says to Emily, "Well the comment I made earlier will hopefully be the only stupid one I make for a long time."

21:41:10 Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

21:41:19 Emily Ford says, "Oh, that one. I'd almost forgotten about that."

21:41:27 Vernos Bailey says, "Me too."

21:41:30 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well worst case we could just stop in the middle of nowhere and recharge with what we have and probably gain some cycles."

21:41:37 Emily Ford nods to Nissi Valdaire.

21:41:43 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

21:41:49 Emily Ford says, "I commented earlier that we've probably got enough in the hold until we find something."

21:41:57 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

21:42:18 Eli Grey roams in from the east.

21:42:22 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

21:42:29 Eli Grey takes a bite of a cold ice cream sandwich.

21:42:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Pre-stellar would work well enough, is full of things that burns well."

21:42:50 Morris Corlew says, "That, nebula, oort has comets that'll mostly burn pretty well."

21:42:54 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah."

21:43:05 Emily Ford says, "We should have brought along a pair of pilots known to argue lots as entertainment."

21:43:16 Vernos Bailey says, "I have been fixed on the locations console."

21:43:19 Morris Corlew says, "You've got me and Mel."

21:43:21 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:43:28 Emily says to Morris, "Ah, carry on then."

21:43:29 Eli Grey says to Emily, "At least ti's entertaining to watch Ailing and Ather insult each other."

21:43:33 Emily Ford grins.

21:43:37 Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.

21:43:38 Eli Grey says, "Er.. aisling."

21:43:44 Eli Grey says, "Yeah.. that's how you say it."

21:43:49 Eli Grey takes a bite of a cold ice cream sandwich.

21:44:00 Morris says to Emily, "Actually we don't near as much as we used to. I got to the point I just realize she's right most the time and don't bother anymore."

21:44:02 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:44:11 Eli Grey grins.

21:44:12 Vernos Bailey says, "I will gladly pick up shovel and throw debris into furnance."

21:44:13 Eli Grey takes a bite of a cold ice cream sandwich.

21:44:18 Morris Corlew gives Vernos Bailey a thumbs up!

21:45:04 Vernos says to Morris, "Plus I could use the excerise."

21:45:12 Morris Corlew chuckles at Vernos Bailey.

21:45:23 Morris says to Vernos, "Actually, I enjoy shovelin myself."

21:45:25 Morris Corlew shrugs.

21:45:36 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

21:45:36 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
Morris Corlew says, "Not myself I mean..."

21:45:40 Morris Corlew says, "Ahem."

21:45:45 Morris Corlew asks, "I myself, enjoy shovelin?"

21:45:53 Vernos Bailey nods.

21:45:58 Eli says to Morris, "I wouldn't normally agree, but it is good when you've been cooped up in a starship for a few days. Helps to get the blood flowing."

21:46:14 Morris says to Eli, "Yeah, that's what I mean. I do enjoy it."

21:46:37 Emily Ford says, "It's the only chance I have to get hot and sweaty."

21:46:41 Emily Ford frowns.

21:46:45 Eli Grey smirks.

21:46:49 Vernos Bailey says, "Wow."

21:46:50 Eli Grey pats Emily Ford on the back.

21:47:00 Vernos Bailey says, "My mind went straight there."

21:47:16 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

21:47:35 Emily Ford takes another large bite of a roast beef sandwich.

21:47:50 Vernos says to Morris, "I blame the general communications channel for my perversions."

21:47:57 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

21:48:00 Eli Grey laughs at Vernos Bailey.

21:48:02 Eli Grey takes a bite of a cold ice cream sandwich.

21:48:16 Morris says to Vernos, "So...you're like every pilot in existence almost that had no impure thoughts ever before becomin a pilot?"

21:48:32 Vernos Bailey says, "No I had them for sure."

21:48:38 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

21:48:41 Vernos Bailey says, "They just got worse in space."

21:48:46 Morris Corlew laughs.

21:48:51 Emily looks up from her sandwich and asks in a soft tone, "What are impure thoughts?"

21:48:59 Morris Corlew looks at Emily Ford thoughtfully.

21:49:04 Morris Corlew looks at Emily Ford and shrugs. "I dunno."

21:49:09 Eli Grey says, "My head was always too m uch in the stars to pay attention to Melinda's butt shorts before..."

21:49:15 Eli Grey says, "I mean.. uh.."

21:49:25 Morris covers his mouth and laughs.

21:49:25 Eli Grey says, "Um.. women's butt shorts."

21:49:29 Eli Grey coughs.

21:49:42 Morris Corlew says, "Well. Now we know one more pilot has a crush on Melinda."

21:49:44 Morris Corlew grins.

21:49:51 Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself.

21:49:58 Eli Grey finishes off a cold ice cream sandwich.

21:50:31 Eli Grey says, "I didn't say that I just uh.. oh nevermind."

21:50:40 Morris Corlew pats Eli Grey on the back. "I won't tell on ya."

21:50:41 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:51:12 Emily Ford asks, "Nobody's going to tell me what impure thoughts are then?"

21:51:14 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

21:51:15 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

21:51:15 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly, Luja is pretty good looking."

21:51:22 Emily Ford says, "I'm completely innocent, you see."

21:51:29 Luja blinks.

21:51:31 Eli says to Emily, "I think they might just be regular thoughts for you."

21:51:33 Eli Grey nudges Emily Ford gently.

21:51:36 Vernos Bailey says nothing.

21:51:36 Nissi Valdaire grins.

21:51:38 Vernos Bailey says nothing.

21:51:40 Emily Ford stares at Eli Grey.

21:51:50 Morris says to Eli, "You might be right."

21:51:52 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:51:53 Luja Garland says, "I heard my name."

21:51:53 Eli shrugs and grins.

21:52:10 Vernos says to Luja, "No one said Luja at all."

21:52:13 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Vernos Bailey.

21:52:13 Emily Ford says, "I need to call up Marvin Cykes and have a case brought against the blue guy."

21:52:15 Vernos Bailey smirks.

21:52:17 Morris Corlew grins.

21:52:18 Eli Grey says, "Uh.. I'm getting the stare."

21:52:23 Morris Corlew asks, "Marvin Cykes?"

21:52:25 Eli Grey laughs.

21:52:35 Emily says to Eli, "He prosecuted the slavers."

21:52:44 Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

21:52:47 Eli Grey nods to Emily Ford.

21:52:50 Eli Grey says, "I know."

21:53:12 Emily Ford says, "I probably don't have a case though."

21:53:14 Emily Ford finishes off the last of a roast beef sandwich.

21:53:21 Morris Corlew says, "Oh yeah."

21:53:24 Emily Ford gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

21:53:28 Eli says to Emily, "What are you gonna sew me for? Gneral Teasing?"

21:53:30 Morris Corlew says, "I knew I recognized the name, but...couldn't think where."

21:53:34 Eli Grey says, "Er.. general teasing."

21:53:37 Vernos says to Luja, "All I said was you look cute."

21:53:39 Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings.

21:53:43 Vernos says to Luja, "If you must know."

21:53:46 Emily says to Eli, "Accusing me of being impure by default. That's so.... something."

21:54:46 Vernos Bailey says, "I had taken an interest in Evenia but I think she is into someone else honestly."

21:55:00 Eli says to Emily, "As if you weren't one of hte pilots that helped me get over blushing and spluttering all the time."

21:55:02 Morris Corlew says, "Uh."

21:55:04 Eli Grey grins.

21:55:08 Morris says to Vernos, "Yeah, you could say that."

21:55:09 Morris Corlew shrugs.

21:55:17 Emily says to Eli, "I was? Do you recall that time..."

21:55:19 Emily Ford laughs.

21:55:21 Vernos says to Morris, "Hm?"

21:55:32 Morris Corlew shakes his head at Vernos Bailey. "Nothin."

21:55:42 Vernos says to Morris, "Hit me with it straight dude."

21:56:02 Eli Grey raises an eyebrow at Emily Ford.

21:56:04 Emily says to Eli, "Anika dared me to go to that briefing with the Admirals wearing just my nighty and flight boots. Nobody seemed to notice."

21:56:06 "Made a promise long time ago I intend to keep." Morris Corlew shakes his head. "Others can tell ya. I ain't gonna do it."

21:56:11 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

21:56:14 Vernos Bailey nods.
Eli Grey laughs.

21:56:21 Vernos says to Morris, "I can respect that."

21:56:23 Eli says to Emily, "I do remember that actually."

21:56:28 Emily says to Eli, "Then I met up with you on Invaders command and you noticed right away."

21:56:37 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

21:56:45 Vernos says to Morris, "You are a good man dude."

21:56:47 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

21:56:49 Emily Ford laughs.

21:56:52 Morris Corlew shrugs.

21:56:57 Morris says to Vernos, "If you think so."

21:57:07 Vernos says to Morris, "Never done me wrong."

21:57:09 The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under emergency boost.

21:57:14 Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.

21:57:17 Emily Ford says, "I seem to recall it was both Nissi and Anika who pushed me into doing that."

21:57:38 Emily says to Nissi, "You were a bad influence on me, such an innocent woman at one time."

21:57:38 Morris says to Emily, "Some look like proper dresses. Was it one of them?"

21:57:43 Eli says to Emily, "I believe I was coming out of my quarters and thinking "Oh, great, I'm having that random sexy lady pilot dream again""

21:57:52 Eli Grey laughs.

21:57:54 Emily says to Eli, "I don't recall."

21:57:55 Morris says to Emily, "You? Innocent? I need to find a time machine."

21:57:58 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

21:58:03 Emily Ford stares at Morris Corlew.

21:58:09 Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.

21:58:33 Emily Ford says, "My feelings are gushing blood."

21:58:50 Eli says to Emily, "I'm not sure.. I justremember you were in the docking bay."

21:58:56 Emily Ford nods to Eli Grey.

21:58:58 Emily Ford says, "I was."

21:59:14 Morris Corlew chuckles at Emily Ford. "Just...I've never known ya to be the innocent type. I'm sure you musta been...just...never saw it. It ain't no insult, just...it is what it is."

21:59:19 Eli comforts Emily.

21:59:24 Vernos Bailey says, "I should send QE message and say still alive out here."

21:59:41 Emily Ford says, "If I had a time machine, I would have gathered the scraps of evidence."

21:59:51 Eli says to Emily, "Hey, we wouldn't have you any other way. I never meant to imply it was a bad thing."

21:59:57 Emily Ford sniffles.

21:59:58 Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.

22:00:11 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Eli Grey and nods to Emily Ford. "Exactly."

22:00:19 Emily says to Eli, "Oh, I'm just playing the victim for effect."

22:00:23 Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly I could not picture any of you any differently than you ae."

22:00:26 Emily says to Eli, "Just don't tell anyone else."

22:00:32 Morris says to Eli, "She's tryin to still look innocnet."

22:00:33 Morris Corlew grins.

22:00:39 Melinda says to Vernos, "It's better to ask before using someone's quantem device. Some are more strict with it than others."

22:00:41 Morris says to Vernos, "Folks change."

22:00:48 Vernos says to Melinda, "Oh always."

22:00:58 Morris says to Vernos, "I'm not the same as I used to be."

22:00:59 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

22:01:01 Vernos says to Melinda, "I'd never touch it without asking."

22:01:11 Eli Grey snickers.

22:01:14 Emily Ford says, "I've changed. I'm taller than I was when I was a baby, for example."

22:01:23 Vernos Bailey chuckles at Emily Ford.

22:01:37 Morris says to Emily, "You know what I meant."

22:01:41 Morris Corlew says, "I uh..."

22:01:41 Emily Ford nods to Morris Corlew.

22:01:44 Emily Ford says, "I know."

22:01:53 Emily Ford says, "I'd like to think I've changed."

22:01:54 Morris Corlew says, "Ahem...don't blush as much...and do a bit more thinkin for myself."

22:02:13 Emily Ford says, "I've got James to thank for a lot of my change."

22:02:20 Emily Ford frowns.

22:02:22 Vernos Bailey says, "I am still adjusting to being a pilot honestly but you guys have honestly helped a lot."

22:02:55 Emily Ford looks at Vernos Bailey thoughtfully.

22:02:59 Vernos Bailey says, "A bit of knowledge from everyone here was gained I think."

22:03:10 Emily says to Vernos, "You do realize we'll all be mailing you invoices for the assistance, right?"

22:03:18 Vernos says to Emily, "If you do, you do."

22:03:23 Morris Corlew laughs at Emily Ford.

22:03:24 The ship's reactionless drive whirrs loudly as it changes direction rapidly.

22:03:32 Emily says to Vernos, "And if you don't pay, we send in the fleet."

22:03:39 Morris says to Vernos, "Don't worry. I don't charge."

22:03:53 Vernos Bailey nods to Emily Ford.

22:03:57 Vernos says to Emily, "Deal."

22:03:57 Emily says to Vernos, "He doesn't charge much. He's always leaving words off the end of his sentences like that."

22:03:58 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:04:09 Emily Ford glances at Morris Corlew.

22:04:30 Vernos Bailey says, "Morris is a walking, talking QE comm."

22:04:40 Vernos Bailey says, "Full short hand."

22:04:40 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

22:04:57 Minor Change: The comings and goings of AI ships will no longer be evident to people in lounges.

22:05:11 [MTTS] usfolks: Woo. Less spam.

22:05:15 [MTTS] Ulias: Aww.

22:05:16 Vernos says to Morris, "Not an insult, I promise."

22:05:18 [MTTS] something: Woo, great change.

22:05:22 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:05:29 Morris says to Vernos, "Didn't take it as such."

22:05:30 Vernos says to Morris, "You just pack in all the info needed without all the words."

22:05:32 [MTTS] babyboy: Finally! Why, thank you!

22:05:34 [MTTS] Butchulla: That's an awesome change.

22:05:35 [MTTS] Ulias: I personally liked it.

22:05:42 [MTTS] something: I mean it was cool the first 352 times but then.

22:05:42 [MTTS] Ulias: Made everything seem more alive.

22:05:45 Morris says to Vernos, "That's the first time I've been accused of that."

22:05:46 Morris Corlew laughs.

22:05:51 [MTTS] andawn: I also liked it, but I can see why it was changed.

22:05:54 Vernos Bailey laughs.

22:05:56 Morris says to Vernos, "Most folks think I'm wordy and talk too much."

22:06:10 [MTTS] stormrider: Woo.

22:06:12 [MTTS] Butchulla: I'd have been happy with an option to turn on an ignore feature, but that works too. Thanks hosties!

22:06:20 Vernos Bailey says, "Well I havent known you long enough to think that of you."

22:06:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Yet."

22:06:34 Morris Corlew laughs.

22:06:38 [MTTS] davetaylor: I agree, it's cool at first, and I do like to see the navy come and go and things like that, but the merchants can be a bit spammy.

22:06:40 Morris says to Vernos, "Most get that impression pretty quick."

22:06:41 Morris Corlew shrugs.

22:06:46 [MTTS] Ulias: Well,  as long as they don't take out the ships themselves, Ilove how much more alive space feels now compared to what it was before.

22:06:58 [MTTS] babyboy: Heh i'm still seeing it.

22:07:11 Emily says to Morris, "Better than saying nothing."

22:07:16 Emily Ford pats Morris Corlew on the back.

22:07:17 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

22:07:20 Vernos Bailey says, "I had an idea for a apartment display case."

22:07:21 [MTTS] ricolachen: Does that include delivery ships such as Tony's?

22:07:45 Emily Ford says, "These expeditions can get pretty quiet, we need talkers to remind us we're still alive."

22:07:53 Eli noggles.

22:07:58 Vernos Bailey says, "I want to get an image from every expedition I go on and have them in there or hung on my wall with a plaque or label under it to say when and where I was."

22:08:16 "Guess so." Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet. "Just...ya get the idea folks just want ya to keep your mouth shut when they start bettin on makin ya speechless."

22:08:16 Morris Corlew shrugs.

22:08:48 Vernos Bailey says, "I could run around the ship naked, that would make everyone speechless."

22:08:54 [MTTS] Squidmind: Those are AI ships, so yes!

22:09:06 Morris says to Vernos, "Nobody wants to see your dangly bits."

22:09:20 Morris smoothes his shipsuit.

22:09:34 Vernos Bailey says, "You are most likely correct."

22:09:37 Emily Ford looks at Vernos Bailey thoughtfully.

22:09:40 Eli says to Vernos, "If you start running around here, cockflapping, I'm gonna hide in the ducts until it's all over."

22:09:51 Morris Corlew laughs at Eli Grey.

22:09:58 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:10:03 The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under emergency boost.

22:10:07 Emily Ford says, "Put the ship on nudger alert."

22:10:13 Vernos says to Eli, "I would not put anyone through such horrors unwillingly."

22:10:29 Emily Ford says, "That sometimes does happen with the voting game, however."

22:10:32 Eli Grey says, "Nudger alert? I like it."

22:10:41 Vernos Bailey asks, "Nudger alert?"

22:10:41 Eli Grey laughs at Vernos Bailey.

22:10:56 Emily Ford says, "Yes, we switch the red bulb for a blue one."

22:10:58 Emily Ford nods.

22:11:08 Luja Garland asks, "What're we talking about?"

22:11:11 Luja Garland glances around at her surroundings.

22:11:16 Morris says to Luja, "I have no idea."

22:11:16 Luja Garland examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

22:11:19 Luja Garland helps herself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:11:20 Vernos says to Luja, "Streaking arond the ship I think."

22:11:29 Luja Garland says, "Oh, that."

22:11:51 Eli says to Luja, "Yep, vernos streaking and Emily's purity."

22:11:53 Luja carefully blows on a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:11:55 Emily Ford says, "Vern offered to run around the ship in his pink and crinklies."

22:12:05 Melinda Michaels says, "Um."

22:12:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Woo."

22:12:13 "His what?" Morris Corlew looks at Emily Ford thoughtfully.

22:12:25 Lily Kaise examines a small hot tea dispenser for a moment.

22:12:27 Emily says to Morris, "Sans fabric."

22:12:29 Eli says to Melinda, "And no one said anything at all about your butt shorts."

22:12:31 Morris Corlew asks, "Pink...and...crinklies?"

22:12:33 Lily Kaise helps herself to a cup of hot green tea.

22:12:34 Morris says to Emily, "Oh."

22:12:38 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:12:42 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot green tea.

22:12:49 Vernos says to Melinda, "Someone said something about making people speechless, so I said I know how to make everyone speechless."

22:13:05 Vernos Bailey says, "And offered to streak around the ship."

22:13:09 Melinda says to Vernos, "Ah."

22:13:11 Morris says to Vernos, "Well...if it were me they'd likely scream, so..."

22:13:15 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

22:13:18 Emily Ford says, "I always thought it should have been said as pink and wrinklies, you know, those places where wrinkles naturally occur on some people..."

22:13:27 Eli Grey snickers.

22:13:31 Melinda Michaels grins.

22:13:42 Vernos Bailey asks, "So this is the coversations that occur on expeditons?"

22:13:44 Morris Corlew shakes his head and chuckles.

22:13:53 Morris says to Vernos, "This is nothin."

22:14:00 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

22:14:00 Emily Ford says, "However, the voting game could see Vern running around with his tent pole on show."

22:14:27 Morris Corlew says, "Ahem."

22:14:37 Emily Ford says, "I need a drink... somthing more than coffee to get the images out of my head."

22:14:40 Emily Ford stands up from a white leather sofa.

22:14:40 Emily Ford slinks east.

22:14:52 Eli Grey says, "If Aisling were in here, she'd have all kinds of entertaining questions to ask about all of that."

22:15:08 Morris Corlew says, "I uh...not sure I ain't got enough of my own."

22:15:11 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:15:11 Emily Ford slinks in from the east.

22:15:13 Eli Grey cackles!

22:15:17 Emily Ford says, "No malt whiskey back there."

22:15:19 Emily Ford sits down on a white leather sofa.

22:15:26 Eli says to Emily, "Damn."

22:15:31 Luja Garland takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

22:15:33 Emily Ford takes a sip of a glass of brandy.

22:15:58 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:17:09 The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under emergency boost.

22:17:29 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:17:30 Lily Kaise glides south.

22:18:30 Emily Ford asks, "So what are we going to do while we wait for the charge to run out?"

22:18:35 Emily Ford takes a sip of a glass of brandy.

22:18:40 Morris Corlew asks, "Keep movin?"

22:18:49 Emily Ford says, "We could sing some songs."

22:18:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Could sit in engineering and watch number go down."

22:19:05 Emily says to Pierre-Louis, "That's the best suggestion so far."

22:19:05 Morris Corlew says, "I need to dig the banjo outta storage sometime."

22:19:06 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

22:19:30 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out.

22:20:33 Emily Ford says, "Well, I'm up for whatever."

22:20:36 Emily Ford takes a sip of a glass of brandy.

22:20:48 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm. We've got enough to play a game of Horrible Stories."

22:20:48 Emily Ford says, "Other than that card game."

22:20:56 Luja Garland says, "If only Anfisa brought her haunted synth rack."

22:21:03 Luja shakes her head sadly.

22:21:51 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

22:21:54 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:21:59 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot green tea.

22:23:58 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I get all my entertainment from anticipating moment computering machine will say it found a thing."

22:24:21 Luja Garland grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

22:24:48 The ship's reactionless drive whirrs loudly as it changes direction rapidly.

22:24:49 Emily Ford takes a sip of a glass of brandy.

22:26:22 Eli Grey asks, "I'm gonna go lie down for a bit, probably just be dozing though. Someone call on the PA if we find something?"

22:26:33 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

22:26:34 Eli Grey says, "I wanna help shovel if I can."

22:26:34 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

22:26:37 Eli Grey nods.

22:26:37 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

22:26:43 Eli Grey says, "See you jokers later then."

22:26:45 Eli Grey waves.

22:26:45 Eli Grey roams south.

22:26:54 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot green tea.

22:27:00 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:27:00 Lily Kaise glides east.

22:27:08 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

22:27:12 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:27:16 Lily Kaise takes a bite of an orange scone.

22:27:43 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps quietly, indicating that it has begun receiving a message.

22:27:43 The computer announces, "Incoming QE message from AFW Command."

22:27:50 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

22:27:52 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

22:28:02 Emily Ford says, "Exciting."

22:28:27 Emily Ford says, "I know what it's going to say."

22:28:41 Emily Ford says, "Can Melinda please come home, we need parts for a station."

22:28:43 Morris says to Emily, "What's that?"

22:28:45 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

22:45:48 Melinda Michaels asks, "What if the Mutuality won't have you?"

22:45:55 Melinda Michaels says, "It's not an easy process."

22:45:59 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

22:46:00 Lily Kaise says, "Then I suppose I wouldn't be Mutuality."

22:46:01 Morris Corlew says, "Nope."

22:46:21 Emily says to Nissi, "Were we in for any of them?"

22:46:24 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

22:51:13 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup recall."

22:51:20 Vernos Bailey says, "In case we run out of charge'"

22:51:25 Ather Jammoa says, "Hmm, I wonder if they're going to recall -us-."

22:51:28 Morris says to Vernos, "We're not gonna run outta charge."

22:51:30 Emily Ford says, "Recalls all pilots from expedition so Best can have a brain."

22:51:38 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

22:52:20 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

22:52:24 Morris Corlew says, "They could just recall their own pilots."

22:52:28 Ather Jammoa says, "He could be just recalling the AEu pilots."

22:52:32 Lily Kaise says, "Yup and not some casual pilot just stirring up shit."

22:52:36 Morris Corlew says, "I...doubt they'd have legal standing to recall this ship."

22:52:51 Morris Corlew says, "It's a League ship."

22:52:52 Emily Ford says, "I still think it would come from the AEU rep at Accord, and this doesn't look like an official message."

22:52:53 Morris Corlew shrugs.

22:53:02 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out.

22:53:05 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it would or should."

22:53:05 Morris Corlew nods to a Tardick lizard named Thor for some reason.

22:53:10 Vernos Bailey says, "That would be one long pod ride."

22:53:14 Ather Jammoa says, "Na."

22:53:16 Morris says to Vernos, "Not really."

22:53:19 Ather Jammoa says, "Be there in probably 2-3 days, tops."

22:54:31 Ather Jammoa glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

22:54:36 Emily Ford says, "Maybe they're going to have another election."

22:54:41 Ather Jammoa chortles.

22:54:44 Vernos Bailey says, "Which would mean most like Best is going to leave the accord."

22:54:44 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

22:54:45 Lily Kaise asks, "Or maybe called to Best's office?"

22:54:55 Morris Corlew says, "If so, I'd imagine that would mean they're pullin outta the Accord."

22:55:18 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/Comedy.

22:55:24 Emily Ford says, "Recalled Colts several times, yet still no sandwiches on sale."

22:57:48 Vernos Bailey says, "Damn."

22:57:54 Emily Ford asks, "Accord personnel?"

22:57:55 [MTTS] Butchulla: Thanks hosts, that made me launch into a giggle that turned into more, which made me cover the keyboard in coffee.

22:57:56 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

22:58:06 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

22:58:07 [MTTS] babyboy: Oh I missed that, haha.

22:58:13 [MTTS] atherj: Sounds like a personal problem.

22:58:15 Lily Kaise finishes off a cup of hot green tea.

22:58:19 Lily Kaise takes a bite of an orange scone.

22:58:22 Lily Kaise finishes off an orange scone.

22:58:25 Emily Ford asks, "Withdrawing AEU people from the Accord in preparation for pulling out?"

22:58:29 Lily Kaise gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

22:58:33 [MTTS] Butchulla: Hahaha.

22:58:39 [MTTS] atherj: I might actually be in the minority, but I tend to never have drinks near my computer.

22:58:41 Morris Corlew says, "Possible."

22:58:43 Melinda Michaels asks, "Well didn't he say he was gonna cut ties?"

22:58:46 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

22:58:54 [MTTS] usfolks: I do, but always with good tight lids.

22:58:59 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

22:59:06 [MTTS] babyboy: I do it in my room, but not in my studio, lernt a painful lesson from that.

22:59:09 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

22:59:14 [MTTS] Butchulla: I have it in a takeout cup and it's beside my bed, so technically not near it.

22:59:19 Ather Jammoa says, "Let us not jump to conclusions! We don't know full contents of grand message."

22:59:24 Lily Kaise nods.

23:00:03 [MTTS] Squidmind: You mean a kid's sippy cup?

23:00:03 [MTTS] usfolks: Soda bottles with lids for the win.

23:00:05 Vernos Bailey says, "At least they are sending important news and not random stuff."

23:00:07 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:00:08 [MTTS] davetaylor: I do that scary thing that is going in the other room and not being by the computer for a sec.

23:00:14 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:00:15 [MTTS] atherj: Don't want accidents: keep drinks and all other forms of liquid away from electronics.

23:00:17 [MTTS] voyager1000: Yes, a kids sippy cup, with two handles.

23:00:23 [MTTS] Butchulla: Hahaha.

23:00:27 [MTTS] usfolks: *snickers*.

23:01:02 [MTTS] voyager1000: Actually mine doesn't have a handle at all. It's just got a sealed lid and a rubberised drinking protruberance.

23:01:14 [MTTS] Squidmind: A curly straw?

23:01:30 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:01:31 [MTTS] kaite: Oh a sippy cup.

23:01:32 [MTTS] voyager1000: I don't, but your question now makes me want to get one.

23:01:32 [MTTS] atherj: Hey, I like the curly straws.

23:01:37 [MTTS] usfolks: Hey, curly straws are awesome.

23:01:44 [MTTS] Squidmind: Curly straws are the best.

23:01:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Bah, they could've left out the O and it would've been much faster."

23:02:07 Morris Corlew nods to Ather Jammoa.

23:02:10 Ather Jammoa says, "Heck, they could've left out one C, too."

23:02:11 Emily Ford says, "They could have left out update."

23:02:19 Vernos Bailey says, "AFW would have worded."

23:02:21 [MTTS] Squidmind: Spoiler for Transformers: A curly straw is the reason the civil war happened.  True story.

23:02:22 Lily Kaise says, "Upd."

23:02:24 Vernos Bailey says, "Worked I nean."
Melinda Michaels says, "Nws AEU rcll acrd."

23:02:26 [MTTS] babyboy: Well other than my niece cup.

23:02:28 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:02:28 [MTTS] usfolks: Dammit.

23:02:29 Melinda Michaels says, "Easy."

23:02:43 Melinda Michaels asks, "Where's Akemi's book?"

23:02:47 Morris Corlew says, "Even one l on rcl."

23:03:11 Morris Corlew says, "The Hypercaster ones are good."

23:03:33 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out.

23:03:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Some others too. The news item and alliance specific things."

23:03:39 Melinda Michaels gives a copy of "QE Codes: Shorthand for Quantum Entanglement Messages" to Damien Goss.

23:03:42 Melinda Michaels gives a copy of "QE Codes: Shorthand for Quantum Entanglement Messages" to Morris Corlew.

23:03:51 Morris Corlew puts a copy of "QE Codes: Shorthand for Quantum Entanglement Messages" in a metallic silver messenger bag.

23:03:57 Damien Goss says, "This one isn't mine."

23:04:10 [MTTS] atherj: Eh, in spite of the ratings, I'm very hesitant when it comes to wonderwoman, but that's probably due to my disdain for DC comics in general except for Superman and Batman.

23:04:11 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:04:12 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:06:07 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:06:24 Emily Ford says, "Yeah, the people who work at the Accord."

23:06:26 Emily Ford nods.

23:06:30 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:06:35 [MTTS] atherj: Oh, is it sad that Rogue 1 was better than Force Awakens in that series?

23:06:54 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:06:57 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:07:08 [MTTS] usfolks: Shoot me if you must. I only like the original 3. I do not mean that literally, however.

23:07:17 [MTTS] usfolks: The shooting part.

23:07:28 Luja Garland glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:07:31 [MTTS] voyager1000: I'm the same, I never bothered with the later created movies.

23:07:47 [MTTS] atherj: Rogue 1 is totally worth seeing. It was pretty brilliantly done.

23:07:53 [MTTS] Butchulla: Same here. The original 3 were great, after that...

23:08:09 [MTTS] voyager1000: I'll make an effort to check it out.

23:08:12 [MTTS] usfolks: I've heard the last one is good, but not sure if I need to see all the other ones I've only seen part of to get anything out of it.

23:08:15 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:08:19 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:08:24 [MTTS] atherj: Na.

23:08:39 [MTTS] atherj: Force awakens pretty much stands on its own long as you know who the iconic characters are.

23:08:52 [MTTS] usfolks: Ok. Might have to check into that then. Thanks.

23:09:36 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:14:28 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:14:35 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:14:45 Vernos says to Ather, "Sorry just having a mixture of feelings currently and want the rest."

23:15:00 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:15:15 Ather Jammoa says, "We'll get the rest. Whether we want it or not, we'll get it soon."

23:15:17 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:15:37 Emily Ford says, "I'm still playing the guess the message game."

23:15:48 Morris Corlew says, "Fun game."

23:16:08 Emily Ford asks, "I said when that first A came up that it was either AEU or Accord, how much more accurate could I have been?"

23:16:11 Emily Ford laughs.

23:16:21 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:16:25 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:16:30 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:16:34 Morris Corlew asks, "No known...somethin?"

23:16:51 Emily Ford says, "Known space? That doesn't make sense."

23:17:13 Melinda Michaels says, "They are going to pull out of accord."

23:17:17 Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings.

23:17:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Is what he said a while ago, no?"

23:17:29 Emily Ford says, "In known space."

23:17:30 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

23:17:33 Melinda Michaels laughs.

23:17:34 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:17:38 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

23:17:42 Morris Corlew says, "One of Best's campaign promises."

23:17:42 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:17:43 Morris Corlew shrugs.

23:17:52 Emily Ford says, "Recall Accord liaisons in known space."

23:18:08 Luja Garland switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

23:18:16 Lily Kaise slumps in a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe and goes to sleep.

23:18:20 Emily Ford says, "I'd just assumed they were all at the Accord station, so didn't understand how known space fitted in."

23:18:31 Morris Corlew shrugs. "Dunno."

23:18:39 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

23:18:59 Morris Corlew says, "N could also be short for and."

23:19:03 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:19:18 Emily Ford asks, "If AEU pull out of the Accord, does that mean we no longer assist them?"

23:19:33 Morris Corlew asks, "Who, them as in AEU?"

23:19:37 Emily Ford nods.

23:19:46 Emily Ford says, "Since they want to go it alone."

23:19:55 "Dunno." Morris Corlew shrugs. "I imagine there might be other diplomatic agreements too."

23:19:59 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

23:20:02 Vernos Bailey says to Emily, "To be fair, its not the pilots that want to go it alone."

23:20:13 Melinda says to Vernos Bailey, "Most pilots voted for him."

23:20:18 Morris Corlew says, "Nah, but...many of them -."

23:20:22 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

23:20:24 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:20:26 Emily Ford says, "Pulling out of the Accord suggests they don't believe they need assistance, and probably wouldn't appreciate any such help."

23:20:27 Vernos Bailey says, "I get the feeling that was to keep their jobs."

23:20:39 Melinda Michaels says, "Still, they voted."

23:20:39 Morris Corlew looks at Emily Ford and shrugs. "Dunno."

23:20:50 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:20:50 Morris Corlew says, "Not known yet something."

23:21:03 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

23:21:13 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:21:39 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

23:21:59 Morris Corlew says, "Not known why."

23:22:00 Morris Corlew nods.

23:22:10 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:22:10 Emily Ford says, "Something like that."

23:22:15 Morris Corlew says, "Ehh...I think we've guessed it already."

23:22:16 Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah."

23:23:06 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:23:48 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:24:03 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

23:24:05 Emily Ford says, "Not known why for."

23:24:09 Morris says to Rogue Romano, "Howdy."

23:24:11 Rogue Romano waves.

23:24:18 Lily Kaise waves.

23:24:21 Morris says to Rogue, "News news news."

23:24:23 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:24:24 Emily Ford says, "It's our Rogue pilot."

23:24:27 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:24:28 Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.

23:24:48 Morris Corlew says, "From...something."

23:25:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Rogue pilote."

23:25:15 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:25:30 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

23:25:33 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

23:25:48 Rogue Romano asks, "News eh?"

23:25:49 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:25:55 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

23:25:57 Morris Corlew asks, "Frn?"

23:25:58 Emily Ford says, "So it would seem."

23:26:01 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:26:03 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out.

23:26:09 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:26:19 Emily Ford asks, "Franklin the elf?"

23:26:25 Vernos Bailey says, "Fringe."

23:26:30 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:26:54 Emily Ford says, "It would be more entertaining if it turned out to eb Franklin who made it happen. Best visited Icy."

23:27:01 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:27:05 Morris Corlew chuckles.

23:27:09 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:27:17 Lily Kaise glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:27:20 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:27:28 Morris Corlew says, "Not know why fringe somethin."

23:27:42 Emily Ford says, "Maybe someone isn't sure why Fringe and League haven't done the same."

23:27:55 Morris Corlew shrugs.

23:27:57 Morris Corlew says, "Dunno."

23:27:57 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

23:28:12 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:28:30 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:28:34 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:28:38 Vernos Bailey says, "Fringe."

23:28:45 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:28:53 Vernos Bailey says, "I think this might be a different headline now."

23:28:58 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:29:08 Emily Ford says, "The E wasn't necessary, this is someone new to entangling."

23:29:13 Morris Corlew nods.

23:29:19 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah seems so."

23:29:23 Morris Corlew considers a mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator thoughtfully.

23:32:44 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:33:54 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:33:59 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:34:06 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:34:11 Morris Corlew says, "Ooh."

23:34:13 Morris Corlew says, "Place to charge."

23:34:17 Morris Corlew gives an excited double thumbs up!

23:34:17 Damien Goss says, "I got this."

23:34:18 Ather Jammoa says, "There. We can charge there."

23:34:19 Damien Goss stands up.

23:34:21 Damien Goss steps south.

23:34:22 Emily Ford says, "And planets as well."

23:34:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Yea."

23:34:31 Damien Goss's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Unless you want to do it Vernos."

23:34:42 Ather Jammoa says into the PA microphone, "Why don't both of you just do it?"

23:34:55 Emily Ford asks, "Did we establish if you can run the planetary surveyor while scoping?"

23:35:00 Melinda Michaels says, "You can."

23:35:02 Ather Jammoa says, "Yep."

23:35:05 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:35:08 Emily Ford says, "That's convenient."

23:35:11 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

23:35:11 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

23:35:12 Lily Kaise nods.

23:35:12 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

23:35:14 Melinda Michaels says, "We did that the first planets we found."

23:35:15 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:35:41 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:35:41 Morris Corlew says, "Fringe is skipping, skating, skiing..."

23:35:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Are we gonna deploy observation probes even if planets sucks?"

23:35:59 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Nissi Valdaire and shrugs helplessly.

23:35:59 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

23:36:03 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/SC.

23:36:05 Ather Jammoa says, "I mean, if we have to sit and charge anyway, why not? It's Nissi's call or another cat though, I suppose."

23:36:05 Vernos Bailey asks, "Seeking?"

23:36:09 Vernos Bailey switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

23:36:11 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:36:16 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

23:36:22 Emily Ford asks, "We might as well. Do we need to come back later or will the telemetry be sent on wherever we are?"

23:36:23 Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey. "Possibly."

23:36:30 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:36:33 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly south.

23:36:35 Morris says to Emily, "We'd have to wait a couple hours on it."

23:36:37 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:36:38 Emily Ford nods.

23:36:41 Morris says to Emily, "So might as well charge while we do."

23:36:50 Emily Ford says, "I don't see any problem waiting if it's essential data."

23:36:50 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:37:00 Ather Jammoa says, "And who knows? Maybe there will be a green planet."

23:37:07 Ather Jammoa says, "If there is, then well."

23:37:14 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

23:37:21 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "It all becomes irrelevant!"

23:37:24 Emily Ford says, "If there's an Outsider outpost, we can flag it for an invasion fleet."

23:37:32 Eli rubs his eyes.

23:37:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Data will take at least half a cycle of probing, don't need to be there when probe is done, but need to come back to it."

23:37:42 Eli Grey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:37:48 Ather Jammoa nods.

23:37:55 Melinda Michaels says, "Easier to wait for it if we are charging anyway."

23:37:57 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:38:00 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:38:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Is there a way to see how many probes ship has left?"

23:38:09 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it's going to take awhile to charge from this level."

23:38:12 Emily Ford says, "Fringe asking."

23:38:16 Morris Corlew nods. "Charging'll take longer than the probe."

23:38:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Heck, if we really want, we could send out multiple probes to all planets then pick them all up when recharge is done."

23:38:33 Ather Jammoa chortles.

23:38:33 Emily Ford says, "Fringe asking questions."

23:38:36 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

23:38:37 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

23:38:38 Ather Jammoa says, "But, that's probably a waste."

23:38:50 Aisling the Fox prances in from the south.

23:38:50 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:38:50 Eli Grey asks, "The Union recalled the Accord liaison? And I think it says.. Fringe is asking ehy?"

23:38:56 Eli Grey says, "Er.. Ehy'"

23:38:57 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

23:39:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Ehy, ehy."

23:39:01 Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

23:39:04 Luja Garland glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:39:10 Aisling the Fox says, "Nice news to walk into."

23:39:12 Morris Corlew says, "Asking questions."

23:39:13 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:39:15 Aisling the Fox prances east.

23:39:15 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:39:18 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:39:21 Aisling the Fox prances in from the east.

23:39:21 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:39:23 Aisling the Fox dangles a serving of hot chicken-flavored ramen in a small bowl in front of a Tardick lizard named Thor. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

23:39:34 Aisling the Fox sits down on a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

23:39:38 Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself.

23:39:50 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

23:39:53 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

23:40:06 Luja Garland takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

23:40:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Readjust damien oh gosh readjust."

23:40:15 Melinda Michaels says to Pierre-Louis, "I thought there was a way to see remaining probes but not sure."

23:40:35 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

23:40:37 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

23:40:37 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

23:40:37 Eli Grey says, "I thought it was in the status display."

23:40:40 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:40:40 Morris points to the probes button.

23:40:46 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah someone said in engineering and I certainly couldn't tell on my ship nor this one."

23:40:49 Morris Corlew says, "Nah."

23:40:51 Melinda Michaels says, "Ah ha."

23:40:56 Morris Corlew says, "That button right there."

23:40:59 Emily Ford says, "We have sixty-eight."

23:41:01 Eli Grey says, "Oh hey, I didn't even notice that."

23:41:06 Morris Corlew nods.

23:41:09 Eli Grey says, "Damn designer buttons, blending in with stuff."

23:41:09 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh. Look. A thing."

23:41:10 Morris Corlew says, "It's kinda outta the way."

23:41:11 Morris Corlew shrugs.

23:41:12 Morris Corlew grins.

23:41:24 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

23:41:24 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

23:41:28 Lily Kaise says, "You can see which databanks, and other equipment are installed but sure would be good to know how many of which probe are available."

23:41:43 Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:41:46 Morris says to Lily, "That button...the one I pointed out."

23:41:49 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

23:41:59 Morris points to the probes button again, then nods to Lily.

23:42:00 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:42:00 Emily Ford says, "I'm sure Nissi knows which probes she purchased."
Ather says to Morris, "I think she wants a rundown of the types of probes, too."

23:42:01 Lily says to Morris, "It was a vague button."

23:42:02 Eli Grey says, "It doesn't say what types though."

23:42:07 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Hmm, more probes than my galleon for sure. It can only hold fifty-five."

23:42:17 Lily Kaise says, "That is exactly what I am saying."

23:42:18 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

23:42:21 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

23:42:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:42:24 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:42:24 Morris Corlew says, "Sorry, misunderstood."

23:42:26 Eli Grey asks, "You could perhaps, go into the launch menu and see which ones are avilable, then cancel out of it?"

23:42:26 Melinda Michaels says, "She's got multifunction probes."

23:42:26 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Eh, you'll be able to upgrade them later."

23:42:37 Pierre-Louis says to Ather, "I have same rack expansion, though."

23:42:41 Ather says to Eli, "Doesn't tell you how many in that menu either though."

23:42:45 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

23:42:48 Lily Kaise says, "I have three different types on mine."

23:42:54 Melinda Michaels asks, "3?"

23:42:56 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "You don't have an expedition-class vessel though, only exploration-class."

23:43:03 Lily Kaise nods.

23:43:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Alas."

23:43:12 Melinda says to Lily, "Which three?"

23:43:13 Morris Corlew says, "JM."

23:43:20 Morris Corlew asks, "James...maybe?"

23:43:21 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:43:30 Lily Kaise says, "It seems I purchased three different types. Obviously lots of LTC away so can't exactly look atit."

23:43:34 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:43:35 Lily Kaise says, "It."

23:43:36 Vernos Bailey asks, "Can we make that?"

23:43:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:43:44 Morris says to Vernos, "Make what?"

23:43:46 Melinda Michaels says, "Unless you have a lander, you don't need three."

23:43:49 Vernos Bailey says, "That system."

23:43:56 Morris Corlew says, "We're headed for it."

23:44:00 Morris Corlew says, "Goss is up there."

23:44:00 Ather nods at Melinda in agreement.

23:44:22 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't max out on the 70 slots available so."

23:44:38 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:44:42 Ather Jammoa asks, "Wow. Tac platform can hold 70?"

23:44:43 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:44:48 Lily Kaise nods.

23:44:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "The 7500 and 10,000 points probes can both do impact and observation. The second one just got slightly better definition."

23:45:03 Ather Jammoa nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

23:45:04 Emily Ford says, "That's fairly respectable."

23:45:06 Lily Kaise says, "I got everything for 7500."

23:45:07 Morris Corlew says, "I thought it depended on the racks."

23:45:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Tac platform got seventy? I might need to check my galleon racks later again."

23:45:16 Aisling the Fox says, "I need 7500."

23:45:16 Aisling the Fox sighs.

23:45:18 Ather Jammoa nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

23:45:18 Lily Kaise nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

23:45:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Mine holds 77."

23:45:28 Morris Corlew says, "Gonna be quite awhile before I have 7500."

23:45:28 Emily Ford says, "So Nissi has better racks than Pierre."

23:45:30 Ather Jammoa says, "I just need like 1100 more exploraiton points for the 10000 stuff."

23:45:31 Morris Corlew chuckles.

23:45:32 Ather Jammoa chuckles.

23:45:35 Aisling the Fox grins at Emily Ford.

23:45:35 Morris says to Emily, "Of course."

23:45:37 Aisling the Fox knocks on Emily Ford's head.

23:45:38 Aisling the Fox says, "Bonk."

23:45:45 Emily Ford knocks on Aisling the Fox's head.

23:45:47 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:45:47 Lily Kaise says, "I need heh 2200."

23:45:50 Emily Ford says, "Bonkety bonk."

23:46:03 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:46:08 Eli Grey sighs. "I remember the days when I was the one with the most exploration points in the AEU, now I'm like five thousand behind."

23:46:13 Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.

23:46:20 Lily Kaise pats Eli Grey on the back.

23:46:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Exploration-grade rack expander II seems to be the popular one at moment."

23:46:30 Ather says to Eli, "Well, since you've been gone, I've been on a few expeditions, a few artifacting runs, needed to do a lo tof glyphmaker stuff."

23:46:35 Lily Kaise says, "Yep that's what I have."

23:46:43 Eli says to Ather, "It's all those damn glyphmaker stations, isn't it?"

23:46:47 Eli Grey chuckles.

23:46:48 Ather Jammoa says, "Na."

23:46:51 Aisling the Fox pokes Ather Jammoa in the ribs!

23:46:54 Ather Jammoa says, "Actually I think I'm still under a thousand of those."

23:46:56 Melinda Michaels blinks heavily and then dozes off.

23:46:58 Aisling the Fox says, "Yes, Graves."

23:46:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Maybe like 500, tops."

23:47:01 Lily Kaise says, "Got a lot of exploration points from Planets maaayin."

23:47:03 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:47:03 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I got lot of the points from the rainbow aliens, I think."

23:47:14 Aisling the Fox says, "You change color to go with me and never want to go."

23:47:15 Aisling the Fox sighs at Ather Jammoa.

23:47:15 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Yeah, remember when we use to go all the time?"

23:47:21 Ather Jammoa says, "So we could ge tyour galleon sails."

23:47:23 Vernos Bailey asks, "Fringe skng q jms k?"

23:47:24 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I don't get much from their crystal rods and other scrap anymore, though."

23:47:24 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:47:30 Emily says to Eli, "It's okay, I still have less than four thousand exploration."

23:47:32 Ather says to Aisling, "You have horrible timing. Night time is hard."

23:47:33 Aisling the Fox says, "James retired."

23:47:37 Eli Grey says, "Um."

23:47:44 Morris Corlew says, "Asking questions about James Kennedy."

23:47:45 Morris Corlew shrugs.

23:47:47 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I get about a half a point per artifact from out there but the pay is still great."

23:47:47 Ather says to Aisling, "Isn't it enough that we still try!"

23:47:55 Emily Ford considers a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device thoughtfully.

23:47:58 Eli says to Emily, "You don't think that's talking about James do you?"

23:48:03 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:48:05 Aisling the Fox sighs at Ather Jammoa.

23:48:07 Eli Grey asks, "Jms K?"

23:48:08 Lily Kaise says, "Oh wow could be."

23:48:13 Aisling the Fox exclaims, "James Kennedy!"

23:48:13 Eli Grey says, "Weird."
Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

23:48:13 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:48:21 Ather Jammoa glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:48:24 Nissi Valdaire says, "I found planets."

23:48:30 Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire.

23:48:31 Eli Grey smiles at Nissi Valdaire.

23:48:33 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:48:34 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

23:48:36 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Woo Nissi!"

23:48:37 Luja Garland says, "Ohh."

23:48:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Woo."

23:48:42 Emily says to Nissi, "And your rack is better than Pierre's."

23:48:44 Emily Ford nods.

23:48:46 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:48:49 Lily Kaise laughs.

23:48:50 Eli Grey cackles!

23:48:52 Nissi Valdaire says, "Thanks."

23:48:52 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I hope so!"

23:48:52 Rogue Romano smirks.

23:48:54 Vernos Bailey chuckles.

23:48:55 Luja Garland glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:48:57 Lily Kaise giggles.

23:49:12 Emily Ford says, "I'm sure it holds a much better quality probe too."

23:49:24 Ather Jammoa says, "Man, this ship is going to take 50 hours to recharge."

23:49:29 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:49:30 Lily Kaise nods.

23:49:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "We sending observation probes on all space rocks while we charge, Capitaine?"

23:49:42 Vernos Bailey says, "Or a crew of eighteen who shovels."

23:49:47 Emily Ford asks, "What the fuck are they asking about?"

23:49:54 Ather says to Vernos, "It'll still take a long time to recharge."

23:49:55 Morris Corlew says, "No clue."

23:49:58 Ather Jammoa says, "The shoveling isn't the issue."

23:50:00 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:50:01 Lily Kaise glides south.

23:50:01 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:50:04 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

23:50:07 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:50:10 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:50:15 Emily Ford says, "We can turn off some ship systems while we charge, that should help it to go faster."

23:50:23 Morris Corlew asks, "Wait...he misspelled the shortening of Kennedy?"

23:50:26 Ather Jammoa says, "No, that freefloater power thing will probably help enough."

23:50:28 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "3 percent of charge."

23:50:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "My methods of sending complex messages is much more efficient."

23:50:54 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "I am forced to agree."

23:51:05 Aisling the Fox says, "I hate shoveling."

23:51:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Is very clears and provides crew with cycles of entertainment."

23:51:10 Morris Corlew says, "KNDY would have been efficient."

23:51:17 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:51:19 Morris says to Pierre-Louis, "And cycles of headaches."

23:51:20 Luja Garland stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:51:21 Luja Garland steps east.

23:51:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Bah."

23:51:27 Eli Grey says, "Also ties up the entangler though, if we need it."

23:51:27 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:51:35 Emily Ford says, "I wonder if they're asking if it's really James Kennedy."

23:51:35 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:51:36 Morris Corlew nods to Emily Ford.

23:51:43 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

23:51:47 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

23:51:48 Lily Kaise glides east.

23:51:48 Morris says to Emily, "Like...he got replaced or somethin?"

23:51:51 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:51:52 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:51:59 Emily Ford says, "He behaved the same."

23:51:59 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:52:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "James Kennedy is new Accord liaison?"

23:52:04 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:52:18 Luja Garland steps in from the east.

23:52:21 Luja Garland sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:52:23 Luja Garland takes a few big flavorful spoonfuls from a hot cup of chicken noodle soup.

23:52:29 Rogue Romano asks, "Huh?"

23:52:31 Vernos says to Luja Garland, "Not a bad choice."

23:52:36 Luja Garland grins at Vernos Bailey.

23:52:39 Vernos Bailey finishes off a hot cup of chicken-flavored noodles, leaving just a cup of heavily-flavored pasta water.

23:52:46 Cheri Lindbergh glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:52:47 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

23:52:49 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:52:55 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.
Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:52:55 Morris Corlew says, "Kenidy."

23:52:55 Vernos Bailey gives a foam cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

23:52:59 Luja says to Vernos, "Excellent choice, yes!"

23:53:02 Luja Garland takes a few more spoonfuls of a hot cup of chicken noodle soup.

23:53:08 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:53:12 Emily Ford says, "I mean, there's no I in Kennedy, but eh."

23:53:20 Morris Corlew nods to Emily Ford. "That's what I was thinkin."

23:53:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Eh the message that counts."

23:53:24 Cheri Lindbergh says, "What the hell does that even mean."

23:53:27 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:53:36 Morris Corlew says, "No one knows why the Fringe is asking questions about Kennedy."

23:53:37 Morris Corlew shrugs.

23:53:40 Nissi Valdaire glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:53:46 Vernos Bailey says, "I think it says seeking to question james kennedy."

23:53:55 Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

23:53:56 Ather Jammoa says, "Maybe he took off and went to join Sabin."

23:53:58 Lily Kaise says, "Well James was Fringe."

23:54:00 Morris Corlew says, "Or asking questions about James."

23:54:05 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Oh, it's seeking to question him."

23:54:10 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:54:11 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

23:54:14 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Haha maybe."

23:54:17 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Maybe not."

23:54:21 Emily Ford says, "Oh."

23:54:21 Lily Kaise nods.

23:54:26 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:54:38 Rogue Romano says, "I don get why. Our voice made it clear on comm of his..."

23:54:44 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

23:54:45 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:54:53 Lily Kaise asks, "He went Antispinward what a couple years ago?"

23:55:02 Morris Corlew asks, "Maybe the reason for his retirement?"

23:55:16 Lily Kaise says, "Long time for them to finally figure things."

23:55:16 Emily Ford stands up from a white leather sofa.

23:55:26 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, he's going to deal with the soutward angle first, then go east."

23:55:30 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:55:44 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:55:50 Morris Corlew says, "Goin for speed."

23:55:54 Emily gives her head a light scratch.

23:55:54 Cheri Lindbergh glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:55:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Yes, yes. Tacking."

23:55:59 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:56:01 Morris Corlew nods.

23:56:02 Ather Jammoa says, "Doing an angle at a time."

23:56:08 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:56:11 Vernos Bailey says, "Well speed is needed."

23:56:14 Morris Corlew says, "But."

23:56:20 Ather Jammoa says, "Bah, 3% is more than enough to get us there."

23:56:21 Vernos Bailey places a plain white spacesuit helmet atop his head.

23:56:25 Vernos Bailey removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly into a standard starship flightbag.

23:56:32 Morris Corlew chuckles at Vernos Bailey.

23:56:34 Morris says to Vernos, "Worry wort."

23:56:46 Ather says to Vernos, "We do have perfectly functional emergency bubbles."

23:56:48 Aisling the Fox says, "Zoom."

23:56:52 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:56:55 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:57:00 Ather Jammoa says, "There we go, now he can adjust it."

23:57:00 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.
The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

23:57:02 Emily Ford asks, "Because?"

23:57:05 Eli says to Ather, "Oh, I threw those out, I thought they were old wrappers."

23:57:11 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

23:57:12 Morris Corlew nods to Emily Ford.

23:57:19 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

23:57:24 Emily begins to pace nervously.

23:57:37 Eli comforts Emily.

23:57:42 Eli Grey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:57:59 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

23:58:00 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:58:13 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

23:58:20 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:58:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, if he gets us so we have to go north, that will definitely help a bit."

23:58:26 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I have a metal ball which James crafted for me from all of the cans I gave him of food. That was an interesting gift!"

23:58:40 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

23:59:00 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:59:01 Vernos Bailey asks, "Who is driving?"

23:59:05 Ather Jammoa says, "Damien."

23:59:05 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.
