The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

15:20 A mauve card with a kitten border
Tibo,
I love you more than anyone or anything in this Universe. I don't want you to go, to disappear nor do I want to leave you.
I'm so sorry for accusing you of abuse. It just struck me so odd
that all of a sudden we successfully got rid of the Muzati and the
otono and then you were cold towards me. I felt hurt and baffled
when I thought I had done the best I knew how to and only wanted to
bea a team player. Yes you mentioned about how you had used a
certain method in the sim. Well Love, this is wonderful but you
never once asked me, would you try this or let's walk through this
method so we're on the same page or anything. You just assumed
things in that you accused me of overriding your preference when I
was not even aware that you wanted me to do things your way in the
first place. So what I meant about abuse was if you become angry
towards me for not picking up on what you want me to do and then
have a justification of your chosing, then that would be, in my own
humble opinion, rather mean-spirited. So I apologize for saying that you were abusive. You know Tibo, I truly want to please you, to do whatever you prefer and above all, I respect it that it's your ship we're in. I would hope though, that since we are married and a union, that even in my ships, that you would know that I give you more leaway than I would anyone else to do things in the manner that you prefer because I do respect you as i've seen you become a very capable pilot. I don't think it should be a matter of it's just 'my ship' either. even though the ship is owned by me, whereever we dwell or co-exist together should be ours and not just mine. Still, it goes without saying, that I love you and I want to please you and to honor your preferences. All you had to do was just say to me that you would like it if I would try this other method or at least ask me if I would be comfortable trying it. I probably would have initially said no but I'd try it in a simulator first or if we could try it with a BZZR or such or even an unknown where we're not shooting at the ship. I do want to do things more efficiently and to minimize risks as well. So no Love I don't think you are not worthwhile because of a situation like this but I just felt that if you were going to continue to treat me this way everytime i mis-understood or didn't do things exactly the way you wanted that you would turn this coldly towards me, that I truly felt as though I wanted to escape. I do truly want to work this out though Love. This is not worth your disappearing out into deep space at all either. It works both ways too. If you want to throw away what we have worked hard to achieve, and do this, then I can't stop you but it is telling me that I'm not enough for you I suppose which makes me sadder than you can ever imagine. I feel like such a failure when you say things like this because our vows
15:20  do state that we should work through our challenges and not run away from them.
As for the Bard and such, if you had of just ignored what i suggested, I wouldn't have been totally comfortable. Still, I do respect it that it's your ship and I would have just shrugged it off and if your bard got low and we had to spend a lot of time hunting down friendlies to barter with, then so be it. If we managed with what you had provisioned, then guess what! you would have proved me wrong which certainly wouldn't have made me angry at all! I actually thought you would have only added another 1500 bard in the first place. All this to say that you do have the right to do things the way you want and in my mind, I would have just gone along with your decision even though I wasn't totally comfortable with it and the reason is that I do respect your choice even though I might not always agree with you. If I was right in the end, I wouldn't make anything of it as I'd just consider it to have been a learning experience for you if I was right and for me, if you were right. So nobody is at fault here at all.
I love you,
Katrianne

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras
19:37 h bin. You also see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, a translucent architectural design simulator, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, Kissy the droid, a hologram of a beach sunset projected on one wall, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, Kitcat the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a red handheld planetary surveyor here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

19:37 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

19:37 Katrianne Beauchene carefully places a thin glass sphere containing a smoky representation of an alien galaxy into a purple velvet artifact storage container.

19:37 [Chatter] Michael Calaway transmits, "Because I have both things, we came out to make the buck, and well there's cally to do the other thing."

19:37 The computer announces, "Navigational automatic vector interface has assumed flight control. Vectoring northwest and up..."

19:37 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

19:37 You will no longer see starship movement messages. (Silent mode engaged.)

19:37 [Chatter] Tom Tucker transmits, "I'm pretty sure they're not in something that small. Comms range extends about 2,000 years out. A freighter would take ages to make it that far out, even with solar panels."

19:37 The computer announces, "The nearest navigational beacon is located in Sector 5 and is 1000.5 lightyears distant."
