-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
[s6hkJ_uA$+g$.Fw7"~ZdjvM9x9a~5j.lB{Oj5*{
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I think we've been getting them though."

no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Good day AEU. Happy Election Day. Be sure to
visit the New Phoenix Courthouse and cast your vote for President. Concerning
another very disturbing matter, if anyone has a key to Demarco Scott's Mule,
'Rise Up', please check to see if the felo in this starship are properly fed
and/or take any mean felo from the ship to Hyperion. It is apparent that there
are recent felo deaths because of the odor coming from this ship. Thank you for
any assistance you can provide. [13:48  1 November 2316 GST]

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a dusky pink rattan
cabinet, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy

cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple
and light purple cloth rug, a small seashell pink trash can, a small red ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and a small oval turquoise rattan
table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
a}uo\19^FM)6jbY5.>"H?@m*q~;2%R,v>-CbWSjI
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2166 light-minutes per second from Galactic North and
Up."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, welcome to Belt of Orion. As you travel to the bubble or one of the
asteroid stations, fly safe, keep an eye on your charge and make sure to have
enough EAOS credits for the tolls. Have a nice day!"
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh interesting they lowered the toll."
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

This large spacious lobby funnels traffic into the court during official

Periodically, you see attorneys discussing matters quietly with alliance
citizens, citizens who don't enjoy quite the degree of legal freedom that most
starship pilots are granted out of necessity -- in space, the only law is
survival of the fittest. When in port, however, even pilots are open to limited
amounts of prosecution for criminal complaints filed by other pilots if the
alleged crime is viewed by the alliance leadership as dangerous to the alliance
or as being against the alliance itself. A voting booth has been erected here.

for the most expensive and far flung colonies, and then open rebellion by those

This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

Once a waystation between Old Earth and its newly settled colony, the Colonial
Gate station is now largely irrelevant, but still stands guard here as a sort of
watchtower.
The Centauri Colony remains Old Earth's only remaining major extrasolar
possession. The planet does not appear to be particularly teeming with life,
with the color of the land fading from brownish grasses to grey bedrock.
Via general sector communication, Centauri transmits, "Greetings, Unicorn!
Welcome to Centauri Colony Orbit!"

The road widens a little more here as it approaches Shetland Boulevard, the main

commercial buildings bear new coats of paint, and some have new roofs. Bright
banners flap from second and third-story windows, proclaiming triumphant

A huge four-way metal arch stands over this intersection, reaching thirty meters
into the sky, with its tip situated exactly at the center. Foot and vehicle
traffic bustles below the arch, and you can't help but notice the business is
brisker here than along the spaceport road to the south. Restaurants dot each
corner of the intersection, some under repairs but most operating at full
capacity. Shetland Boulevard stretches away to the east and west, while broad,
tree-lined Memorial Drive continues northward. Above you, darting under the
arch, the city's elevated train tracks spread out in the four cardinal
directions. A major station sits directly atop the intersection. You can't help
but notice that the arch nearest you has something inscribed on it in a large
industrial script.

[Outland City; Memorial Drive]
Memorial Drive is a broad, verdant stretch of boulevard, divided by a wide
parklike median. The median is shady, bisected by a wandering path and dotted
with towering oaks and wrought-iron benches. The city's Blue Line elevated train
track runs north-south along the center of the median. On either side of the
street, five, six, and seven-story buildings cast long shadows. On the street
level, shops and restaurants dominate, with an occasional doctor or lawyer's
office. Colorful awnings flutter in the breeze. Above, the buildings' balconies
are strung with drying laundry, with open doors blaring music and holovid noise
into the street. To the south, you can make out the massive intersection of
Memorial and Shetland. To the north, Memorial stretches away into the distance.
Among the shops here is one marked "Business Cats: Pilot Souvenirs and
Clothing."

twisty pathway that bisects the median, laboring in the shadow of the Blue Line
track. Bubbling fountains, elaborately planted landscaping, and ancient trees
are tended by the sanitation drones that buzz about the area like worker bees.
Fashionable, time-honored restaurants, clothiers, and antique shops occupy the
lower level of the streetside, with spacious apartments situated above. One such
shop has display windows filled with beautiful stained glass lamps. A sign over
the doorway reads, 'The Light House.' Memorial Drive continues, straight as an

balconies, but generally the atmosphere is more subdued here than to the south.

The eastern side of the four-way arch glimpsed to the west also serves as an
entry gate to the city's International Quarter, a vibrant district crammed to
the gills with food, wares, and busy citizens. Traffic, both of the vehicular
and pedestrian variety, is thick here. Street vendors call above the clamor,
advertising their food, drinks, and trinkets. Tall, flat-faced buildings have
shops on the ground floor and cramped apartments above. On the south side of the
street, you see a Head and Hair franchise. From the open windows of these homes,
the sound of holovids and the latest pop tunes waft through the air. The
International Quarter extends along Shetland to the east, while to the west you
can make out the gateway into the city.

This section of Shetland is a bustling heterogenous mix of restaurants, shops,

can make out technology superstores, tax preparation services, clothing and
entertainment chains, and a diverse assortment of Indian and Middle Eastern
eateries. One outlet in particular catches your eye, sporting a brightly colored
yellow and blue sign with stylized type reading 'Import/Export.' The boulevard
is lined by wide sidewalks, cracked with age and some wartime damage but packed
with businessmen, mothers and children, and youths. Small elms are planted at
regular intervals along the pavement on either side of the street, giving shade.
Street vendors add to the already overwhelming clamor, hawking their wares to
passersby.

The imposing mansions of Knockhill to the northeast give way to the
International Quarter, so-named in the early days of the colony when colonists
from various Old Earth democracies flooded here in droves. The resultant mix of
cultures produced a vivid mix of building styles, cuisines, and neighborhoods,
many of them clustered here along Shetland Avenue. Smaller streets lead off into
residential areas, while Shetland itself is lined with various ethnic
restaurants, boutique clothing and furniture stores, and small business offices.
To the north, Water Street is a smaller thoroughfare packed with charming
single-family homes and neighborhood eateries. Overhead, the combined Red and
White Line tracks diverge at a busy station.

vehicles. The road has been recently repaved, and freshly laid swaths of sod
line the asphalt, adorned with beautiful flowerbeds. A large sign facing traffic
heading toward the city reads: 'Outland City: United We Survive.' Immediately to
the north, the road crosses a wide river via a long suspension bridge, where
traffic flows freely through a checkpoint manned by a single guard. Above you,

rushes at a mighty pace. Though most have been cleared away and sold as scrap,
through the murky cobalt blue waters you can still make out a few rusted hulks
that were once small starships, riverboats, or personal vehicles. To the north,
the freshly repaved spaceport road continues toward the city, and to the south

other debris from the Outsider bombardment. Many businesses are open, but not
many of them seem to be doing much business. To the north and south, Memorial
Drive looks as vibrant as ever, and to the east St. Jude flows through a quiet
neighborhood of apartment blocks and small businesses. The Blue Line elevated
train track runs along the median here, stretching north and south from the

underground in the median, just ahead of the intersection, travelling under the
park. Around the edge of the Loop, ritzy restaurants and clothing boutiques
flourish behind wide open spaces dotted with tables festooned with large
colorful umbrellas. The buildings around the Loop are three or four stories
tall, with shops on the lower level and apartments above. The Loop continues to

roundabout, flocked with groups of parents and children and all manner of
push-cart vendors. Across the lanes of traffic you can see an entrance to the

This busy intersection marks the confluence of commercial and industrial zones
in the city, with towering office buildings alongside large factories and
assembly facilities. Working-class men and women are found in abundance here,
walking to and from work or dining at roadside food stands. Executives can be
seen leaving office buildings and stepping into expensive-looking coaches,
departing for parts unknown. Most of the buildings here have been fully repaired
from the wartime bombardment, and many new coats of brightly colored paint give
the area an unlikely cheer. However, a nearby factory is barred off with large
orange barriers and marked with a faded sign indicating that it was to reopen in
'Spring 2311.' Across the street is a thriving fine cabinetry shop, 'Welborne
Cabinetry.' Stairs snake up toward an elevated train station. To the north,
Houston Drive rises with the terrain, headed for its intersection with Sheffield
Boulevard. To the south you can make out the greenery of Shetland Memorial Park.
Avenue of Industry shoots off to the east and west, though the western branch is
still blocked off to traffic. Government machinery labors to clear away the
charred rubble in that direction.

roadway boasts a fresh coat of asphalt, and new plasteel supports the hulking
mass of the elevated train track. A large sign in front of one building proudly

This cheaply built prefab building is about what you'd expect from a

inexpensive plastic chairs are hemmed in by metal end-tables stacked with gaudy
magazines. A window with a small counter looks in on the office to the north,
manned by a very prim secretary. From behind the wall to the south, through the
cracks around a swinging plywood door, you can hear the sounds of hammering,
drilling, and casually offensive shouts. Fluorescent lighting pours down on you
from above, just a bit too dimly. A small placard is situated next to the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights

[Wasp "Lord Of The Wasps Wasp One"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You can go down and out.
