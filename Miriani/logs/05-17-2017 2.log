00:01:12 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the south.

00:02:00 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami

00:02:43 a Tardick lizard named Asteria

00:02:43 This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

01:21:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Anybody want to haul an asteroid?"

01:21:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sorry, not at the moment."

01:22:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Tomorrow maybe, but I am about to head to bed. I am just seeing if I can have a brief word with Eli, if not I will call it a day."

01:23:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "What day are you going to call it? I suggest... eTuesday?"

01:23:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.

01:24:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

01:24:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I've got a few more hours before I do the same."

01:25:12 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

01:25:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on your shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:29:06 I see no "outreach" here.

01:34:12 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

01:34:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Should there be asteroids in the uncharted space around the glittering belt?"

01:35:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, yes there are, as well as frontier cluster."

01:35:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are they just sort of rare? I'm gone through about half a dozen empty sectors."

01:36:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Kim."

01:36:12 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:36:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do not really haul there often."

01:36:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And yes, Vernos?"

01:37:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around your neck.

01:38:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The few times I did haul at Glittering belt, I never found any asteroid closer than, hmm, at least 2 or 3 sectors out from the processor station."

01:38:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I was wondering about your org."

01:38:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ok, what would you like to know about it?"

01:39:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Of course I wil gladly talk about Starseekers."

01:39:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well I had thought about asking for an invite. So I don't really know what to ask."

01:40:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, I see."

01:40:12 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

01:40:45 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey."

01:40:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, an invite is easily arranged. So, what kind of an org are you looking for?"

01:41:11 I see no "outreach".

01:41:44 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Tamra has been initiated on her first nest."

01:41:57 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip cheers for Tamra Swenson!

01:42:01 [General Communication] Jada Nelson cheers.

01:42:04 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire cheers.

01:42:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am trying to figure that out."

01:42:13 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Do any of you know what initiated means?"

01:42:22 [General Communication] Alexandra Rose transmits, "Did she blow up."

01:42:26 [General Communication] Bryan Stout applauds sedately.

01:42:26 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Now I think I do."
[General Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "No."

01:42:32 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Indeed."

01:42:33 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Exploded."

01:42:34 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:42:41 [General Communication] Alexandra Rose laughs.

01:42:45 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Woo."

01:42:45 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "That was awful."

01:42:51 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "You get used to it."

01:42:52 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Here I thought she got flashed."

01:42:55 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Absolutely awful."

01:43:04 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Ah well."

01:43:09 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It happens to most on first nests."

01:43:12 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "She got flashed by me before. There isn't much worse, or is there."

01:43:16 [General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.

01:43:18 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Oops."

01:43:20 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

01:43:22 [General Communication] Jada Nelson laughs.

01:43:27 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "She hasn't seen these sexy bee catchers yet."

01:43:36 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "You hush."

01:43:37 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Go pecs!"

01:43:38 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Wow."

01:44:44 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ouch."

01:45:12 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

01:45:20 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Nope I am uninjured."

01:46:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah. Well, Starseekers has been around for nearly 5 years. When I took over I decided I really would like to have more than just a collection of points. It hasn't always worked out quite that way, but the general idea is having a nice place where people who get along hang out, spend their free time and do other things than just only point and credit earning although that is also important. We do have an org exploration ship on which we have already organized or first brief trip out. Morris and Eva are currently my trustees, and we are a really small org. Everyone is welcome really, but that is the general idea. Although we are an AEU org, we do allow members from other alliances to join."

01:47:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hmm."

01:47:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So this cannon..."

01:47:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I shot a bunch of anchors into the rock."

01:47:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Now what do I do?"

01:48:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "We participate in most temporary space stations, such as the ones built out at 273 where we all were last week. We have our own conference room, access to the Gym, pool, sauna and mess hall in the upper level of the office building on New Earth, and the advanced simulator on accord."

01:48:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Right, uh, let me think how I can explain this easily Constantine."

01:49:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No rush."

01:49:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The scenery is actually quite nice."

01:49:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Real austere, you know?"

01:49:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, you have to do these anchors and lines in a particular patern, specificly, east and west from your ship, and north and south."

01:50:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh are lines also a feature of the cannon?"

01:50:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yes."

01:51:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, after you put an anchor say, east from the ship, then you attach a line, move to the opposite side of the ship, place the next anchor and fasten the line so it spools up tightly across the ship, then you do the same things but north and south from the ship."

01:51:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around your neck.

01:52:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I see."

01:52:38 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I need to get a hot bath from just this one."

01:52:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Was the line sold separately from the cannon?"

01:52:51 [General Communication] Bryan Stout laughs.

01:52:56 I don't understand that.

01:53:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No, it's a feature of the cannon."

01:53:03 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Beer, Chetumal S;,u|."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Cool! Then all you have to do is return to your ship, deploy its anchor, and start hauling it."

02:02:40 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

02:02:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "A pig that is hehe."

02:02:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wish, that sounds amazing."

02:02:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah I'm hauling now."

02:03:15 I don't understand that.

02:03:17 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

02:03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Awesome work though. Glad you're mastering those rocks!"

02:03:22 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:03:26 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:03:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Soon, you'll steal the title from me as Asteroid Kin."

02:03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.

02:04:54 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

02:04:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Woo! Goyou."

02:05:10 You carefully remove a Tardick lizard named Asteria from your shoulder.

02:05:14 You give a Tardick lizard named Asteria to Lily Kaise.

02:05:22 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

02:05:27 You grin.

02:05:37 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "So you've been out and about?"

02:05:44 You say, "Yep, a little bit."

02:05:44 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

02:06:36 Lily Kaise says, "I still have 3 beacons left too but doubt I'll get them done since you're ahead of me on beacons."

02:07:03 You say, "I have one beacon left, so I figure maybe we can run missions."

02:07:41 You say, "Although, I'd happily gun on a beacon if they needed me."

02:07:43 Lily Kaise says, "Well maybe I may get lucky to find a beacon to join. Kind of sad to not get them done but oh well."

02:07:48 You nod.

02:08:09 You say, "I know. Alko was just calling for beacons, but nobody volunteered."

02:08:39 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:09:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

02:10:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Now I launch into space a wiser and more jaded individual."

02:10:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I kno asteroids pay very little for newer pilots, particularly without the improved anchor."

02:10:36 You say to Lily, "Did you want to see if Alko wants to do beacons still?"

02:10:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

02:11:25 Lily Kaise says, "I can probably only do beacons or missions but not both at this hour."

02:11:29 You nod.

02:11:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "But yeah, wow, that is very little."

02:12:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I'll double down, go out farther, and try to get an entire credit this time."

02:12:27 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

02:12:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I think I intentionally waited to do asteroid hauling until I qualified for the Hardened Asteroid Hauler and the Anchor package but that's just me."

02:17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "1 Constantine be sure to do every type of mission you possibly can from Space Vermin Patrol."
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Woo."

02:17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, some orgs are not openly recruting, and may not even have their information public, in that case you just need to find out about them from someone and talk to their founders."

02:18:07 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Thanks much."

02:18:31 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Basically, we go to Accord and they assign us combat missions based on the type of ship we have and the strength of mission we want. They are good for combat points and credits."

02:18:42 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We usually get assigned two missions."

02:18:56 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And on average they take about an hour to complete both."

02:20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "The Accord missions pay more credits and more combat points."

02:20:40 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

02:20:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes those are very good and after a point, you won't qualify for them so take advantage of them while you can."

02:20:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "They are, but like I said, there is no point requirement to join a combat crew for missions."

02:20:58 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Just so people know Hamilton's funnel is interdicted for the time being."

02:26:19 Kim Saunders waves to Nathaniel Owens.

02:26:27 Kim says to Nathaniel, "It's been a while, how are you?"

02:26:44 Nathaniel says to Kim, "It has indeed. I'm good. Yourself?"

02:26:51 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Clear."

02:27:01 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Awesome."

02:27:02 Kim says to Nathaniel, "I am doing pretty good too."

02:27:06 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Nope the wormhole won't let me, and there are a bunch of keepers here."

02:27:13 Nathaniel says to Kim, "That's good."

02:27:15 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "No, you're fine now."

02:27:16 A pair of engineers suddenly begin a heated political debate.

02:27:45 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Ah there I am now going."

02:27:50 Kim Saunders takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

02:27:54 Kim Saunders takes a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

02:27:57 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "If you are interested in missions, please proceed to the New Earth Lounge."

02:28:27 Nathaniel Owens asks, "I notice a lot more AEU people on comms. What happened? Did they reopen the doors for new pilots again?"

02:28:33 You say, "They did."

02:28:36 You nod to Nathaniel Owens.

02:28:38 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "We will use the pulsar?"

02:28:38 Kim Saunders nods. "Yes, they did."

02:28:44 Nathaniel Owens asks, "When?"

02:28:58 Kim Saunders says, "Hmm, several weeks ago."

02:29:00 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Depends on how many show up."

02:29:08 Nathaniel Owens says, "Sorry, I just didn't know."

02:29:15 Kim Saunders smiles. "That's all right."

02:29:15 You smile. "You're fine."

02:29:17 Nathaniel Owens says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Which is?"

02:29:34 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person Accord gemini "Galactic Tornado" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:29:58 Nathaniel Owens says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I was about to say. Is it buying something?"

02:30:09 You peer out...

02:30:09 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The two-person Accord gemini "Galactic Tornado" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.

03:16:35 You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Please only use lasers unless otherwise directed. Thank you." and an overstuffed red chair here.
You can go south and down.

03:16:50 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

03:16:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, exactly."

03:16:58 Pilot Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What is the plan, then."

03:17:13 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

03:17:15 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Jump back to A-64 and finish the second wave. Then to mission number two."

03:17:18 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Getting the FTL repaired currently."

03:17:27 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We have a problem though."

03:17:28 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "And yeah, what Lily said."

03:17:34 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

Nathaniel Owens is sitting on an overstuffed red chair.
You can go east.

03:17:43 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am not excited about Nathaniel's lack of gunning."

03:17:55 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

03:17:58 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Neither am I, but we can't bring new people into the mission."

03:18:05 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Especially with the big ships that could be a problem."

03:18:10 Pilot Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah."

03:18:16 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes I find it very annoying when someone commits to a mission and wont perform to complete it."

03:18:18 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

03:18:22 Kim Saunders strides in from the east.

03:18:24 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I'll drain the grid in room 3 and go to his room after."

03:18:38 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

03:18:38 You nod to Kim Saunders.

03:18:41 Pilot Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Dam."

03:18:54 Kim Saunders stares at Nathaniel Owens. "Hey you, this is not a place to take a break."

03:18:59 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

03:19:09 Shule nods in agreement.

03:19:10 Pilot Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Those big ships needs hard of beating."

03:19:22 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

03:19:33 Kim Saunders asks, "What happens if we bring another gunner in, has that ever happened?"

03:19:44 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All clear."

03:19:44 You say, "It gives us less of a pay out."

03:19:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:19:55 Kim Saunders says, "Hmm."

03:20:01 You say, "Go back. I'll double."

03:20:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:20:14 You peer east...

03:20:14 
[Starship "Critical Strike"; Weapons Room Two]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Please only use lasers unless otherwise directed. Thank you." and an overstuffed red chair here.
Kim Saunders is standing here.
You can go west.

You can go south and down.

03:20:37 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok, like I said, I'll just drain the grid in room 3 and then go to Room 1."

03:20:41 Pilot Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "But we can gt someone to help if he accepted not to get payed?"

03:20:51 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Losing a bit of pay would be preferable to taking a beating and losing a ship, but you aare the captain and a good gunner, I leave it to you."

03:20:51 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "We get paid less."

03:21:13 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah because they would say we got help and will dock our pay."

03:21:19 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Exactly."

03:22:14 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well, I suppose we will not take Nathaniel on our missions again for a while after this."

03:22:27 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Let's do it. If it gets really bad, I'll take over flying."

03:22:45 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "But people use the Tesla pipe, we need to clear it."

03:22:52 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes."

03:23:00 Pilot Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Engaging."

03:23:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:23:10 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So yes we've been ready so what are we waiting for?"

03:23:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:23:13 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.

03:23:13 You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

03:23:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:23:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:21:08 The starship transitions into another sector.

04:21:13 You hear a loud bang above you somewhere as ship systems are repaired outside.

04:21:15 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

04:21:15 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, and a black leather sofa here.
Pilot Alko Delovega is sitting on a black leather captain's chair.
You can go south and out.

04:21:29 The starship transitions into another sector.

04:21:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

04:21:30 Pilot Alko Delovega presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

04:21:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:21:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:21:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

04:21:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:21:38 You hear a sharp clank from the hull somewhere near you.

04:21:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:21:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:21:41 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:21:42 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

04:21:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:21:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:21:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:21:46 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:21:47 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

04:21:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:21:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:21:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:21:52 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:21:52 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

04:21:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:21:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:21:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:21:56 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:26:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:26:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:26:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:26:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:26:52 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:26:59 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Critical Strike! Welcome to home space!"

04:27:08 You say, "Hey, he can buy a ship to get back. It's not like we stranded him where he's totally helpless."

04:27:11 You accidentally slam your shoulder into Lily Kaise as you attempt to work with a nearby control panel.

04:29:52 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

04:29:59 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

04:30:02 Starship Damage:

04:30:02 
Turret 20: 78%.
HULL: 9%.


Hull damage failsafes remaining: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 97%

04:30:14 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

04:30:24 The damage control computer reports, "Repair of the hull has been completed by the spaceport."

04:30:36 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

04:30:43 You say, "And that, is why they don't let us sign up with an undercrewed gunship for high strength missions."

04:30:54 Lily Kaise says, "Precisely."

04:30:58 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

04:30:59 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

04:31:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

04:31:23 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

04:31:34 You say to Lily, "We're not the first to strand him for going dozey during missions."

04:31:38 The damage control computer reports, "Repair of light turret #20 has been completed by the spaceport."

04:31:39 The damage control computer reports, "All spaceport repairs have been completed."

Lily Kaise followed you.

04:31:48 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:31:48 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:31:56 Lily Kaise asks, "Oh you mean Owens?"

04:32:02 You nod.

04:32:10 You say, "He's been stranded before for the same thing."

04:32:18 Lily Kaise says, "Wow well we won't invite him ever again. It's too dangerous."

04:32:20 Your ship 'Critical Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

04:32:24 You nod.

04:32:29 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:32:30 You say, "I certainly won't."

04:32:32 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:32:43 You exclaim, "Ok, I need a glass of wine or something. That was intense!"

04:32:50 Lily Kaise says, "Alko did well considering."

04:32:55 You say, "He really did."

04:33:01 You say, "He didn't panic."

04:33:16 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah which was pretty amazing."

04:33:23 You nod.

04:33:35 You say, "Ok, let's grab a glass of wine or something. I could use one."

04:33:38 Lily Kaise says, "To only lose two failsafes under the circumstances is awesome."

04:33:42 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:33:47 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:33:51 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:34:02 Lily Kaise asks, "Did you have debris?"

04:34:10 You say, "Oh."

04:34:12 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:34:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:34:25 You say, "Yeah."

04:34:29 You say, "Let's go dump it."

04:34:31 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:34:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:34:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:34:39 Lily Kaise glides south.

04:34:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:34:46 Which sector did you mean?

04:34:46 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

04:34:47 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:34:47 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:34:48 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

04:34:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:34:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:34:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:34:54 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: 3)SU'pjy0jLMdvUFmNymueG24,KkM02MPG7#i;?P
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:34:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:34:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:34:59 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:35:00 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

04:35:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:35:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:35:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:35:04 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:35:05 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

04:35:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:35:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:35:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:25:36 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

05:25:36 You can go up.
Guindalen Jones followed you.

05:25:37 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Airlock]

05:25:38 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Guindalen Jones followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

05:25:39 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

05:25:39 You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Guindalen Jones followed you.

05:25:55 Guindalen Jones nods.

05:25:57 You ask, "We're going to go to Accord and play in the simulators, ok?"

05:26:01 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

05:26:04 Guindalen Jones says, "That's fine."

05:26:09 You say, "Have a seat."

05:26:11 You grin.

05:26:12 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

05:26:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

05:26:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

05:26:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

05:26:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

05:26:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

05:26:45 Guindalen Jones sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

05:26:48 You smile.

05:26:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

05:26:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:26:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

05:26:53 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:26:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:26:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:26:56 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:26:57 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

05:26:58 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:27:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:27:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:27:02 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:27:03 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

05:27:04 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:27:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:27:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:27:07 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:27:08 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

05:27:09 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:27:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:27:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:27:12 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

05:27:15 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Justen Moon. Welcome to Accord space."

05:27:21 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock One).

05:27:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:27:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there anyway to set my ship in continuous motion manually?"

05:27:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like until I tell it to stop or something?"

05:27:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You probably don't qualify for autovector, but yes."

05:27:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

05:27:49 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

05:27:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

05:27:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, I see."

05:27:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Look at the page labeled torus xenology upgrades."

05:27:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:28:03 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

05:28:03 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay One.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
Guindalen Jones is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.)

05:28:06 You pull a large lever towards you.

05:28:06 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

05:28:08 Guindalen Jones says, "I will need to remember taht."

05:28:11 You grin.

05:28:18 You say, "It's a good upgrade."

05:28:20 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

05:28:22 Guindalen Jones is already in your group.

06:00:47 She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is a bit thinner than average with slightly curved hips and pleasantly curved calves. She has broad shoulders and somewhat large breasts. Her face is oval, lightly-freckled, and unblemished, with a delicate nose and round chin. Her lips are soft and pinkish red and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of thin eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and round. Her mid-back length, soft with a slight wave hair is light auburn and drawn back in pigtails. She has neatly trimmed pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a brown leather bomber jacket, a simple short-sleeved buttercup yellow silk dress, and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a small cloth sack, a yellow canvas backpack, and a metachannel FTL communicator. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.

06:24:44 Guindalen Jones asks, "What can you tell me about useing battle suits? And ground fighting?"

06:24:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

06:24:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

06:25:06 You smile.

06:25:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

06:25:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

06:25:18 You say, "Well, There are three types of battlesuits."

06:25:27 Guindalen Jones nods.

06:25:48 You say, "There is the Leagues suit who is responsible for taking most of the damage."

06:25:52 Guindalen Jones says, "I ask because I have to get 4 antena."

06:26:04 You say, "The damages uits, that are responsible for dealing out damage."

06:26:09 You say, "Suits that is."

06:26:16 Guindalen Jones nods.

06:26:28 You say, "And the AEU suit which is a repair suit. And they just repair."

06:26:41 You say, "Well, mainly repair."

06:27:13 Guindalen Jones says, "The way I see it is we do better supporting but we must defend ourselves."

06:27:21 You say, "Then there are suits that are sort of jack-of-all-trades suits."

06:27:31 Guindalen Jones says, "Ooo."

06:28:04 You say, "For example, the rental suit and the mutuality suits are not good at one specific thing, but can do several things, fairly well."

06:28:26 Guindalen Jones nods.

06:28:35 You ask, "Oh, you're talking about the SVP missions?"

06:28:48 You ask, "Where you have to collect the antena?"

06:29:04 Guindalen Jones says, "One sec let me check."

06:29:08 You nod.

06:29:40 Guindalen Jones says, "It does not say where."

06:29:51 Guindalen Jones says, "Just groun missions."

06:29:51 You ask, "But where did you get assigned the mission?"

06:30:14 Guindalen Jones says, "Oh on vermon."

06:30:24 You say, "Yeah, we call those SVP missions."

06:30:33 You say, "Or missions from SVP."

06:30:54 Guindalen Jones says, "Yep the SVP guy."

06:31:37 You say, "So, for those missions, you can use just about any battlesuit, but you might want to start out with AEU just so you know what it's like. Eventually, you can try out other suits and such."

06:32:11 Guindalen Jones nods.

06:32:24 Guindalen Jones says, "I did get one before I fell asleep yesterday."

06:32:29 You exclaim, "Awesome!"

06:32:41 You ask, "Did you get minidrones on it?"

06:32:45 Guindalen Jones says, "Its on new earth."

06:32:48 You nod.

06:32:51 Guindalen Jones says, "Yes."

06:33:16 Guindalen Jones says, "I don't remember the second thing I got for it."

06:33:23 You ask, "Awesome, did you also get all of the abilities you could?"

06:33:46 Guindalen Jones says, "That again I don't recall."

06:33:48 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

06:33:54 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent". The organization has earned 2,747,068.54 credits.

06:34:03 You say, "Ah, ok. You should check that before taking it into combat."

06:34:10 Guindalen Jones nods.

06:34:20 Guindalen Jones says, "I think I got the lazers."

06:34:23 Guindalen Jones says, "I think."

06:34:29 You say, "Ok, so that is your weapon."

06:34:35 You nod.

06:34:49 You say, "But check under abilities and make sure you get all of them you can."

06:34:59 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

06:35:03 Guindalen Jones nods.

06:35:08 Sorry, this amount is over the maximum of 500,000.00 that one can give to a cadet.

06:35:28 You give 500,000.00 AEU credits to Guindalen Jones.

06:35:38 Guindalen Jones asks, "Are you sure?"

06:35:51 I don't see that here.

06:35:53 You smile.

06:35:57 You say, "Absolutely."

06:36:19 Guindalen Jones says, "Alright. Gifts like that I like to double check."

06:36:25 You smile.

06:36:33 You say, "It's really no problem forus."

06:36:36 You grin.

06:36:51 Guindalen Jones smiles.

06:36:52 You say, "I'd give you more but the government won't let me."

06:37:20 Guindalen Jones says, "Its more than fine."

06:37:22 You say to Guindalen, "Any more questions?"

06:37:42 Guindalen Jones asks, "How would I know if there is a ground attack going on?"

06:38:35 You say, "Oh, ground attacks don't really happen. People will call for nests, which is a ground mission and for megapods. Other ground activities include Tesla."

06:39:26 Guindalen nods in understanding.

06:39:31 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

06:39:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay One.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
Guindalen Jones is standing here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.)

06:39:43 You say to Guindalen, "You can  sit down. I don'tbite."

06:39:48 You say, "Erm, don't."

06:39:50 You grin.

06:39:54 Guindalen Jones laughs.

06:39:59 Guindalen Jones sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

06:40:11 You smile at Guindalen Jones.

06:40:38 You say, "So, anything else? You can always come ask me later too."

06:40:48 Oh no! You currently do not have any proteges!

06:40:56 Guindalen Jones says, "If I go on a nest mission how would I get in the suit."

06:41:20 You say, "Well, show you. Your suit will automatically be places aboard a special ship we use."

06:41:26 You say, "We'll."

06:41:56 Guindalen Jones nods.

06:42:39 You say, OOCly, "Just as a side note. If you don't have a mentor yet, you are welcome to request one. Including myself."

06:43:11 Guindalen Jones says, "I have one."

06:43:14 You grin.

06:43:19 You say, OOCly, "Cool."

06:43:34 You ask, "Ok, so anything else?"

06:43:57 Guindalen Jones says, "It would be how to use the suit but that can be later."

06:44:02 You smile.

06:44:11 You say, "Yeah, I can help answer those questions too."

06:44:18 You say, "But later would probably be better."

06:44:33 Guindalen Jones says, "Either way."

06:44:44 You say, "Up to you."

06:45:02 Guindalen Jones asks, "Slightly off form that. Is there a way to cancle an acepted mission?"

06:46:29 You say, "Up to you."

06:46:55 Guindalen Jones says, "Later will be fine."

06:46:56 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Evelyn, did you launch?"

06:47:11 Guindalen Jones says, "Thank you for your help."

06:47:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

06:47:41 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:47:46 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

06:47:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:47:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:48:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:48:01 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:48:05 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:48:06 You smile at Guindalen Jones.

06:48:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:48:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:48:08 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:48:15 Guindalen Jones smiles.

06:48:16 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Justen Moon! Welcome to home space!"

06:48:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:48:27 The computer reports that the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Worker Ant" has jumped into the sector.

06:48:30 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Worker Ant! Welcome to home space!"

06:48:35 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a standard signal: "Greetings."

06:48:47 Guindalen Jones says, "Is there a way to cancle a mission after you have accepted it."

06:48:54 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:48:54 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

06:48:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Justen Moon. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

06:48:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

06:49:02 You say, "Just wait, it'll eventually time out."

06:49:07 Guindalen Jones says, "Ok."

06:49:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

06:49:15 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

06:49:17 You pull a large lever towards you.

06:49:17 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

07:26:30 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, and Vartija the arachnoid security robot here.

08:31:59 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Thanks so much for beacons."

08:32:02 Luja Garland steps in from the north.

08:32:03 Luja Garland steps south.

08:32:06 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "No problem."

08:32:15 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks for having me."

08:32:15 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes, and thank you for beacons."

08:32:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

08:32:25 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm a dense knob."

08:32:26 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks."

08:32:30 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

08:32:34 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

08:32:37 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ignore me, I'm jsut a knob."

08:32:44 Evenia Callseah says, "That's your special thank you for letting me engineer. It's my favorite thing."

08:32:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:32:49 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I forgot we went down once."

08:32:50 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

08:33:01 The starship transitions into another sector.

08:33:02 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Iwas like I never get lost, what the hell."

08:33:08 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "How the fuck do you forget going down?"

08:33:13 You laugh.

08:33:14 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I don't' go down normally."

08:33:17 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Like Owens did earlier?"

08:33:19 The starship transitions into another sector.

08:33:35 Evenia Callseah nuzzles your neck softly.

08:33:41 The starship transitions into another sector.

08:33:46 You say to Evenia, "Oh, I should check to see if Owens is still there. We stranded him."

08:33:51 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

08:34:00 The starship transitions into another sector.

08:34:02 Evenia Callseah arches an eyebrow.

08:34:04 Evenia Callseah asks, "You did what?"

08:34:11 You say, "I left him at Accord."

08:34:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

08:34:23 You say, "He signed up for missions and dozed through the whole thing."

08:34:27 You say, "Dozed."

08:34:31 Evenia says to you, "That...That is not cool. Go and get him."

08:34:34 Evenia Callseah frowns.

08:34:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:35:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

08:35:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:35:53 The starship transitions into another sector.

08:36:03 Evenia Callseah presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

08:36:20 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Dicks."

08:36:25 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hmm?"

08:36:29 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "They really should not be able to do that crap."

08:36:36 Evenia says to you, "Oh. You ever need an engineer and Lily isn't around. Call me. I'll always go. Even if I've done all my beacons."

08:36:37 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Interdicted?"

08:36:41 Evenia Callseah presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

08:36:42 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The 7 intidcitors in the sector."

08:36:46 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Intidictors."

08:36:55 You grin. "Thanks."

08:37:02 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Just shoot them."

08:37:16 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Can we clear the CR a bit?"

08:37:27 Evenia Callseah sighs.

08:37:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

08:37:37 Evenia Callseah says, "Impatient people. Not him."

08:37:41 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Everyone go to the Control Lobby and hang out. Not in the CR."

08:37:49 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It just seems odd when they can jump out on their own. But we can't do that with ours."

08:38:01 You nod.

08:38:03 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So they have better ones than our governmen can get I get."

08:38:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:38:14 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was in cr a bit ago helpin' guide to the BAS sector. Left once entered."

08:38:24 Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Can you go red for a bit?"

08:38:29 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.

08:38:29 You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

08:38:31 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "The interdictors are tuned to the same frequency that our ftl drives are."

08:38:31 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sorry."

08:38:34 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

08:38:37 The ship shudders slightly as its lasers are fired.

08:38:48 Evenia Callseah leans on you.

08:38:53 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

08:38:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

08:40:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:40:12 You feel a mild vibration as the ship's lasers are fired.

08:40:18 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Probably more that they don't mind making illlegal modifications to their ships."

08:40:23 The ship shudders slightly as its lasers are fired.

08:40:28 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Yeah, what Eli said."

08:40:29 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yeah, I gree more with Eli."

08:40:34 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

08:40:51 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "That's scary. The three of us all agreeing? Okay, we need medical."

08:40:57 You laugh.

08:41:04 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

08:41:06 You say, "Except me. I'm normal."

08:41:08 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sorry."

08:41:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

08:41:10 You say, "Always."

08:41:21 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was seeing double intidictors."

08:41:23 Evenia Callseah says, "If you're normal, my skin is white."

08:41:28 You chuckle.

08:41:34 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

08:41:45 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:41:50 You say, "This last one was actually my 9th beacon."

08:41:51 Evenia Callseah says, "Notice I colored my hair? I was sick of the indigo."

08:41:55 You say, "Yeah."

08:41:57 You grin.

08:41:58 Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her close-cropped, bristly hair is glossy obsidian and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces her right upper ear, a thick gold ring pierces her right lower lip, and a thick gold ring pierces her left lower lip.
 She is wearing a heavy wraparound neck chain, a faded black leather jacket trimmed with steel studs, a faded black silk short sleeve shoulderless top, a black leather spiderweb belt with a silver spider buckle, a pair of tight black jeans, and a pair of stompy black leather cross-strapped boots. She is also wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and
08:41:58  purple dichroic glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side, a teal battle hummingbird stamp, and a Tardick lizard named Zeus perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

08:42:01 The starship transitions into another sector.

08:42:04 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

08:42:12 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.

08:42:12 A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are powered down.

08:42:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

08:42:18 Evenia Callseah says, "I'll always engineer beacons even if I've done all mine, so that others can."

08:42:22 You nod.

08:42:30 You say, "I'm happy to gun for beacons or engineer."

08:42:37 Evenia Callseah nods.

08:42:40 You say, "But I can't fly if I've done all of mine."

08:42:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:42:47 Evenia Callseah says, "I'll gun, but I'm a better gunner on a smaller ship."

08:42:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

08:42:54 You peer out...

08:42:54 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The eight-person soothsayer mark two "Supernova" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

08:42:57 Starship Damage:

08:42:57 
No damaged components.


Hull damage failsafes remaining: 12%, 24%, 36%, 48%, 60%, 72%, 84%, and 97%

08:42:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

08:43:03 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "We have no damage."

08:43:04 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

08:43:04 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

08:43:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

08:43:13 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just getting eaos paychecks."

08:43:17 Evenia Callseah laughs.

08:43:18 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ah."

08:43:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

08:43:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:43:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:43:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

08:43:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

08:43:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:43:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:43:41 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:43:42 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Can I get captain up front for a sec?"

08:43:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:43:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

08:43:46 Evenia Callseah says, "Gunships or smaller are where I gun best. Anything bigger and I start slipping."

08:43:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

08:43:46 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yep."

08:43:59 You say, "Ah."

08:44:00 [Starship "Supernova"; Docking Bay]

08:44:00 You can go north and up.

08:44:00 You can't go that way.

08:44:00 [Starship "Supernova"; Corridor Gamma]

08:44:01 You can go north, east, west, and down.

08:44:02 You can't go that way.

08:44:02 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Lobby]
Alexandra Rose and Rogue Romano are standing here.
You can go north, northeast, northwest, and down.

08:44:02 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

08:44:02 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, and a fuzzy stuffed bear here.
Jacob Smitt is standing here. Luja Garland is sitting on an overstuffed black sofa.
You can go south and out.

08:44:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

08:44:12 Jacob Smitt says, "I can't get back in. I was going to transfer."

08:44:14 Jacob Smitt grins.

08:44:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:44:15 Jacob Smitt begins the docking sequence.
You say, "Oh."

08:44:19 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Say no. Always no."

08:44:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

08:44:27 Unlock what?

08:44:28 Jacob Smitt says into the PA microphone, "But my offers come with waffles."

08:44:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

08:44:33 Jacob Smitt brings up the controls to transfer cargo.

08:44:34 You hear metallic scraping as the transfer of the cargo begins.

08:44:34 Starship "Supernova" unlocked.

08:44:36 You say, "There."

08:44:38 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Always yes, yes yes yes."

08:44:39 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Still say no."

08:44:40 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the eight-person soothsayer mark two "Supernova". The organization has earned 681,977.47 credits.

08:44:40 The sounds from the ship's hold cease as the cargo finishes transferring.

08:44:41 Jacob Smitt strolls out.

08:44:42 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

08:44:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I want to take a magmar test drive so bad heh."

08:44:47 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

08:44:48 Jacob Smitt just entered the ship.

08:44:54 Jacob Smitt says, "Lock her up."

08:44:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We all would love too."

08:45:01 Jacob Smitt begins the launch sequence.

08:45:01 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Now if the offer comes with a gingerbread starship..."

08:45:02 Starship "Supernova" locked.

08:45:06 A launch trajectory is located.

08:45:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

08:45:15 Jacob Smitt says, "That always scares me watching folks do."

08:45:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

08:45:19 Jacob Smitt presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

08:45:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:45:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

08:45:22 You ask, "Why?"

08:45:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:45:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

08:45:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

08:45:28 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:45:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

08:45:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:45:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

08:45:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

08:45:33 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

08:45:36 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Supernova! Welcome to home space!"

08:45:38 Jacob Smitt says, "I have had enough things in my life stolen because I trusted to much."

08:45:40 Jacob Smitt presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

08:45:40 Jacob Smitt accidentally slams his shoulder into Luja Garland as he attempts to work with a nearby control panel.

08:45:41 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

08:45:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

08:45:53 Jacob Smitt says, "And then dealing with those unregs."

08:45:56 You say, "Oh, well. Most people can't even launch a cruiser."

08:46:02 Jacob Smitt says, "Ya lock your shit on stations."

08:46:04 You say, "Unless I'm aboard."

08:46:15 Luja tilts her head curiously.

08:46:18 You say, "Well, they can't launch my cruiser unless I'm aboard."

08:46:20 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:46:20 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.
Luja Garland asks, "Stolen?"

08:46:22 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

08:46:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Supernova. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

08:46:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

08:46:27 Evenia Callseah tramps in from the south.

08:46:27 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.

08:46:31 Jacob Smitt says, "Before I became a pilot."

08:46:33 Alexandra Rose walks in from the south.

08:46:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

08:46:35 You say, "Ah, ok."

08:46:36 Evenia Callseah says to Jacob, "Well flown."

08:46:37 Eli Grey wanders in from the south.

08:46:38 You say, "Thanks all."

08:46:40 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

08:46:41 Luja Garland stands up from an overstuffed black sofa.

08:46:45 Rogue Romano says, "Thanks again."

08:46:45 Luja Garland says, "Oh."

08:46:47 Eli Grey holds his hand aloft, his pensive expression communicating a longing not to be left hangin'.

08:46:48 Rogue Romano waves.

08:46:49 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

08:46:49 Jacob Smitt says, "Thanks for letting me give a shot at flying."

08:46:51 Rogue Romano slinks out.

08:46:53 Luja Garland says, "Thanks for the beacons."

08:46:53 You say, "Sure."

08:46:54 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

08:46:56 Alexandra Rose says, "Thanks."

08:47:00 Eli Grey gives an excited double thumbs up!

08:47:00 You grin.

08:47:02 Constantine Stone says, "Thanks everybody."

08:47:03 Evenia Callseah grins at Eli Grey.

08:47:06 You grin at Eli Grey.

08:47:15 Constantine Stone applauds at Jacob Smitt.

08:47:16 Alexandra Rose waves and smiles.

08:47:18 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, nice working with you folks."

08:47:18 Alexandra Rose walks out.

08:47:19 Constantine Stone says, "Nice flying."

08:49:07 Your ship 'Supernova' has been automatically moved into a garage.

08:49:19 You peer up...

08:49:19 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Worker Ant", the one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet", the two-person Accord gemini "Driftwood", and the two-person Accord gemini "Old Man" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.

08:49:32 
[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, and Vartija the arachnoid security robot here.
Eli Grey is sitting on a slim and fashionable couch. Luja Garland and Evenia Callseah are standing here.
You can go out.

08:49:33 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

08:49:53 Eli Grey turns a phone-based holoemitter on.

08:49:55 Evenia Callseah pats Vartija the arachnoid security robot lightly.

08:50:01 Evenia says to Vartija the arachnoid security robot, "You engineered well."

08:50:03 Eli Grey asks, "Will it bother you folks if I watch SSN on my phone?"

08:50:05 You grin.

08:50:13 You say to Eli, "Nope, go for it."

08:50:18 Luja Garland says, "I don't think so."

08:50:23 Evenia says to Eli, "Nah. But I'll tickle you if you don't tell me something good when it pops up."

08:50:37 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person cargo hauler "Rosebud" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

18:21:07 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

18:21:07 This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face. It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however, possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay. The hatch appears to be locked.

20:14:12 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Fearless! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

20:14:14 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:14:18 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-04" has jumped out of the sector.

20:14:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:14:18 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.
The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-66" has jumped out of the sector.

20:14:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Fearless. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:14:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:14:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:14:38 You hold Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

20:14:40 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:14:40 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:14:41 You stand up from a black leather captain's chair.

20:14:42 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

20:14:42 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
Constantine Stone is standing here.
You can go up and out.

20:14:46 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]

20:14:46 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Constantine Stone followed you.

20:14:46 You exit the ship.

20:14:46 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The four-person mule "Lumps For Humps", the four-person mule "Tasinacaklar", and the two-person Accord gemini "Fearless" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin and a sanitation drone here.
Tamra Swenson is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.
Constantine Stone followed you.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the spaceport.

20:14:48 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

20:14:48 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Joel Kringle is sitting on a comfortable wooden chair. Keyonna Bradley, Alexandra Rose, Ali Candan, and Evelyn Devereaux are standing here.
You can go out.
Constantine Stone followed you.

20:14:50 Joel Kringle says, "I should switch suits."

20:14:50 Tamra Swenson just arrived.

20:14:51 Joel Kringle chuckles.

20:14:51 Joel Kringle scrambles to his feet.

20:14:51 Joel Kringle strides out.

20:14:52 Tamra Swenson says, "Hi."

20:14:53 You wave.

20:14:57 Ali Candan says, "Sec. Getting Alexandra's suit."

20:14:57 Tamra Swenson asks, "What are you all doing?"

20:14:58 You hug Tamra Swenson.

20:15:02 Tamra Swenson hugs you.

20:15:05 Evelyn Devereaux says, "I want to do a nest not tesla and my suit is at vVermin."

20:15:05 Keyonna Bradley exclaims, "Tam!!"
Tamra Swenson smiles.

20:15:07 Constantine Stone waves.

20:15:10 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Hi to you!"

20:15:12 Tamra Swenson smiles.

20:15:12 Your ship 'Fearless' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:15:13 You say to Tamra, "Saying hi to you."

20:15:13 Joel Kringle just arrived.

20:15:14 Tamra Swenson hugs Keyonna Bradley.

20:15:17 Alexandra Rose smiles.

20:15:19 Keyonna Bradley hugs Tamra Swenson.

20:15:22 Joel Kringle holds Keyonna Bradley's hand, taking her into his group.

20:15:23 Joel Kringle holds Evelyn Devereaux's hand, taking her into his group.

20:15:25 Evelyn Devereaux asks, "So how is everyone?"

20:15:25 Tamra Swenson asks, "I see that but everyone?"

20:15:26 Joel Kringle sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.

20:15:28 Tamra Swenson laughs.

20:15:29 Ali Candan's group strides out.

20:15:34 Tamra Swenson asks, "Can I help out?"

20:15:38 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person Accord gemini "Gtr Beni Gittiin Yere" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

20:15:40 Keyonna Bradley exclaims, "I'm doing great!"

20:15:43 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person cargo hauler "Primo Quidem".

20:15:45 Tamra Swenson smiles.

20:15:45 Joel Kringle says, "Depends on if this dude shows up or not."

20:15:49 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Oh!"

20:15:52 You're already standing.

20:15:55 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

20:15:55 Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people. The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Keyonna Bradley, Evelyn Devereaux, Constantine Stone, and Tamra Swenson are standing here. Joel Kringle is sitting on a comfortable wooden chair.
You can go out.

20:15:55 Tamra Swenson says, "Well i'm here for the grouping."

20:16:02 Joel says to Tamra, "You want to do some Tesla?"

20:16:02 Sawyer Reid just arrived.

20:16:15 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Yes!"

20:16:16 Keyonna Bradley says, "I was here for nests but then someone said something about tessla and now I want to."

20:16:18 Tamra Swenson says, "I love tesla."

20:16:21 Joel Kringle chuckles.

20:16:22 Tamra Swenson smiles.

20:16:25 Joel Kringle holds Tamra Swenson's hand, taking her into his group.

20:16:26 You grin.

20:16:30 You say, "Tesla is fun."

20:16:31 Joel says to Sawyer Reid, "You down for some Tesla?"

20:16:34 A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the steaming beverage.

20:16:35 Keyonna Bradley smiles at Sawyer Reid.

20:16:40 Tamra Swenson gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

20:16:41 You wave to Keyonna Bradley.

20:16:45 Keyonna Bradley smiles at you.

20:16:59 Tamra Swenson says, "I have my suit here."

20:17:01 Sawyer Reid says, "I just had my suit transported from..."

20:17:04 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "So that's fortunate!"

20:17:04 Sawyer Reid shrugs.

20:17:05 Sawyer Reid says, "Ok."

20:17:12 Tamra Swenson says, "It's tier one."

20:17:12 Joel Kringle chuckles.

20:17:13 Keyonna Bradley says, "Mine should be here."

20:17:15 Tamra Swenson asks, "Is that a problem?"

20:17:17 Tamra Swenson smiles.

20:17:18 Joel Kringle says, "You're all tier one."

20:17:19 Tamra Swenson says, "Aeu."

20:17:21 Joel Kringle holds Sawyer Reid's hand, taking him into his group.

20:17:23 Tamra Swenson giggles.

20:17:26 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Wonderful!"

20:17:34 Joel says to Sawyer, "I would've brought it over for you if you asked."

20:17:34 You hear the ringing of the nearby ferry and the answering calls of seagulls.

20:17:41 You say, "But I want to be tier.5."

20:17:44 Joel Kringle whistles.

20:17:48 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "A worthy goal!"

20:17:49 Joel Kringle says, "Tier five is sick as fuck."

20:17:50 Tamra Swenson cheers for you!

20:17:58 You grin at Joel Kringle.

20:18:02 Tamra Swenson grins at Joel Kringle.

20:18:14 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Weeha!"

20:18:15 Joel Kringle gives you a high five.

20:18:18 You grin.

20:18:22 Joel says to you, "That's hot bruh."

20:18:26 You chuckle.

20:18:29 Keyonna Bradley nods.

20:18:32 Sawyer Reid nods.

20:18:34 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person Accord gemini "Gtr Beni Gittiin Yere".

20:18:43 Ali Candan's group just arrived.

20:18:45 You say, "It is."

20:18:46 Evelyn Devereaux says, "So did someone hear I wanted to get my suit from Vermin, its a tier 1 Fringe."

20:18:49 You smile.

20:18:53 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 832".

20:38:58 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

20:38:58 (20 seconds roundtime.)

20:39:18 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

20:39:18 (20 seconds roundtime.)

20:39:38 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

20:42:56 Alexandra Rose nods.

20:42:57 Constantine Stone says, "I assuming you want me to focus on repairing."

20:43:01 You say, "And do't move until I do."

20:43:04 You say, "Er, don't."

21:16:03 (20 seconds roundtime.)

21:16:23 [Aerial Fortress "Tasiyici"; Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

21:16:23 The aerial fortress appears to be hovering just inside the entrance of a RATS nest.
You see Constantine Stone (AEU Light Combatant) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
You rocket through the fortress's entrance hatch and stumble to a stop on the deck.

21:16:24 Alexandra Rose abruptly rockets in through the entrance hatch, having returned from the surface, and stumbles to a stop on the deck.

21:16:24 Ali Candan abruptly rockets in through the entrance hatch, having returned from the surface, and stumbles to a stop on the deck.

21:16:51 You speak into the microphone.

21:16:54 Alexandra Rose says into the PA microphone, "Yay."

21:17:00 A quiet beep serves to notify you that the aerial fortress has completed repairs of all stored equipment.

21:17:06 The aerial fortress suddenly fires its ascent thrusters, rocketing toward open space.

21:17:15 Constantine Stone says into the PA microphone, "Yeah that was great."

21:17:26 The vibrations of ascent start to ease off slightly as the aerial fortress leaves the entrance area.

21:17:41 Ali Candan emerges from the lift.

21:17:46 At the top of its ascent, the aerial fortress gently comes into contact with "Tasinacaklar" and the docking clamps snap into place.

21:17:47 Ali Candan moves up through the starship access tunnel.

21:18:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:18:43 You hear a loud bang above you somewhere as ship systems are repaired outside.

21:18:49 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I'm done for now guys. Thanks for the nest."

21:18:55 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "And great job."

21:19:00 You smile at Alexandra Rose.

21:19:01 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anytime. Sandra, go get the cores from the storage."

21:19:07 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

21:19:08 You say, "Go south."

21:19:08 Alexandra Rose walks south.

21:19:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:19:18 The starship transitions into another sector.

21:19:23 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:19:30 Alexandra Rose walks in from the south.

21:19:31 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

21:19:32 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

21:19:35 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Constantine, I'll give you a lift back to New Earth."

21:19:38 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:19:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:19:48 You hug Alexandra Rose.

21:19:48 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I might take a stroll around actually and grab a pod back."

21:19:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:19:55 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I've never been to Old Earth."

21:19:56 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

21:19:58 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Your suit will be left here."

21:20:26 Alexandra Rose nods.

21:20:26 You say, "Thanks."

21:20:27 [Starship "Tasinacaklar"; Control Room]

21:20:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a large leather couch here.

Constantine Stone followed you.

21:20:43 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

21:20:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:20:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:20:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:21:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:21:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:21:08 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:21:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:21:12 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:21:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:21:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:21:15 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:21:28 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:21:29 You grin.

21:21:30 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah."

21:21:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fearless. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:21:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:21:38 You say, "Theyr'e not bad when you do it right."

21:21:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:21:46 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah we went through them pretty easily."

21:21:48 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:21:50 You grin.

21:21:52 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:21:52 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:21:54 Constantine Stone says, "I have 40 ground combat points now."

21:21:58 You exclaim, "Woo!"

21:22:01 You cheer for Constantine Stone!

21:22:07 Constantine Stone says, "I wonder when my next upgrade comes."

21:22:12 You grin.

21:22:16 You ask, "I think at 125?"

21:22:20 Constantine Stone says, "Oh ok."

21:22:22 You ask, "Maybe?"

21:22:24 Your ship 'Fearless' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:22:25 You say, "I'll look."

21:22:26 Constantine Stone says, "I have many more mice to kill."

21:22:29 You grin.

21:22:35 You say, "Squeak squeak."

21:22:39 Constantine Stone laughs.

21:22:52 You say, "Alright, have to doze for a bit. Stay safe."

21:22:55 Constantine Stone says, "Thanks."

21:22:57 Constantine Stone walks out.

21:22:58 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:28:52 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I still have room for one on a megapod tiers 1 and two."

21:36:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'll see if I can't do something about it Vernos, but it won't e until later."

21:36:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That would be great, Eli."

21:37:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Thank you."

21:37:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm that's a good idea too, what she just said. I or someone else coudl probably take you out there and come back and get you later."

21:37:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay."

21:38:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will catch a ride with her until that gets fixed."

21:38:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Pretty sure our org can get the inserters, but i'm not sure what the plicies are on using them ETC. If it's us that's not giving them out anymore I'd like to find out why before just going ahead and doing it."

21:39:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Understandable."

22:23:42 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Let's keep it up! That second performance goal is nearly ours!"

22:24:39 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

22:24:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go up and out.

22:24:41 There appear to be about 19 pilots recently active.

22:28:53 [New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room]

22:28:54 You see Fabious the arachnoid security robot here.
You can go northwest and down.

22:28:55 The postal machine informs you that you have mail waiting.  After some movements coming from the back room, the conveyor belt coming from the wall swiftly brings forth an official-looking letter. You quickly grab it off the belt.

22:29:03 --

22:29:03 Dear Shule Elemmire,

   We have observed your progress, and we deem that it is time for an official employee review. Please proceed to the human resources office.


       Regards,
      Unreality Programming
--

22:29:12 You crumple up an official-looking letter and throw it in a nearby garbage can.

22:29:16 You inform the receptionist that you are here for your review.

22:29:19 Your ship 'Unreality Programming 812' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:29:21 After a moment, Employee ReviewBot 9000 pops out from behind a hidden panel in the wall and rolls toward you.

22:29:26 Employee ReviewBot 9000 vibrates loudly for a moment, then emits a loud "DING!"

22:29:31 Employee ReviewBot 9000 says, "Have a seat." There are no chairs here.

22:29:36 Employee ReviewBot 9000 says, "We are greatly pleased with your progress. You are being considered for a promotion. However, *SEARCHING FOR MOTIVATIONAL COMPETITION... FOUND* Colleen Farley is bucking for the same job, so keep excelling!"

22:29:44 Employee ReviewBot 9000 says, "Now, please list all of your questions and concerns in order of priority."

22:29:56 A ream of printed paper begins rolling out of a port on the side of Employee ReviewBot 9000. The receptionist pushes over a trash can to catch it.

22:30:01 Employee ReviewBot 9000 says, "This concludes your employee review. We will continue to monitor your progress. And if you have any concerns, please remember, I have an open door policy."

22:30:07 Employee ReviewBot 9000 turns and rolls toward the wall, and the hidden panel opens once more to admit it. It vanishes into the bowels of the building, and the panel seamlessly seals itself shut behind it.

22:34:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

22:34:50 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

23:08:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

23:08:11 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.

23:08:18 [Starship "Revenge"; Control Room]

23:08:18 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive, a dark gray leather captain's chair, and a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go down and out.

23:08:19 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:08:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:08:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:08:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Revenge, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:08:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:08:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:08:41 Which sector did you mean?

[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

23:08:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:08:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:08:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

23:08:45 You sit down on a dark gray leather captain's chair.

23:08:46 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:08:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:08:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:08:49 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: 8})&%WuOh.,[t15Gw@AdoU'1YPSa&Gc/unO4_.d.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:08:50 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

23:08:51 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:08:53 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.

23:08:53 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

23:08:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:08:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:08:55 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:08:55 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

23:08:57 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:08:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:09:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:09:00 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:09:01 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

23:11:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:11:44 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:11:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:11:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:11:47 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

23:11:54 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:11:55 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Revenge! Welcome to home space!"

23:11:57 [Tactical Communication] Angela Caesar transmits, "Are the pirates out or taken care of yet?"

23:11:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Revenge. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:11:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:12:06 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Belt of Orion clear."

23:12:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:12:15 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:12:22 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I jumped in and they jumped out."

23:12:27 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:12:27 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:12:39 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They were afraid that you weren't afraid."

23:12:59 Your ship 'Revenge' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:13:15 [Starship "Revenge"; Control Room]

23:13:15 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive, a dark gray leather captain's chair, and a decoy beacon launcher here.

You can go south and out.

23:14:33 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

23:14:35 You glance at your communicator's screen.

23:14:36 Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Hello pilots! I am continuing to see an upswing in decoy beacon drops, which is good! As well as other RAT-related space combat activities. I encourage you all to continue doing what you're doing. However, be careful to not get destroyed (yes, I'm looking at you, owner of the cargo hauler ""Babieca"). Getting ships destroyed does impact conquest goals. If you need any help in space combat, remember you can send letters to Ather requesting training, or call the AEU SDC office. Remember also, that I'm going to organize classes which will teach you all about the current types of enemies that we tend to face. This class will be useful for both newer and older pilots alike. Send me letters with times when you'd most be available, and I'll try to schedule something that works with everyone. [21:14 17 May 2317 GST]
You have one mail message.

23:15:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I found the salvage container of the ship in question along with a pilot that was asleep on the landing pad of New Earth. It's really not advised to fall asleep in space."
