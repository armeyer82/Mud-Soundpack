["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa cover

You can go south, down, and out.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-toole

There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a light yellow rose bush set in a medium sized pot, an ocean blue glass cafe table, a beach cupboard, a white porcelain double sink, a turquoise beech wood counter, a cherry wood trash bin, a periwinkle wooden snack table, a comfortable peach suede sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a teakwood coffee table, a violet trash bin, a turquoise refrigerator, a finch-patterned refrigerator, a translucent architectural design simulator, a tall robotic butler, and a small white wooden trash bin with a small compacter on the side here.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

11:52 ["Seventh Zin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

Intraship Quick Messaging Network
--------------------------------------------------
The Intraship Quick Messaging Network (IQMN) is an add-on for the RAVEN system that allows those aboard the ship to send and receive very short messages to one another. The system operates entirely by voice, so privacy is not guaranteed if somebody happens to be in the same room. To get started, you must first purchase a RAVEN upgrade and summon it to the room with the RAVEN command. The computer will then accept a variety of voice commands to facilitate the sending and receiving of messages. These commands are outlined below:
  Check my messages.
This will alert you if you have any pending messages.
  Read my messages.
This will read every pending message to you at once.
  Read my messages from <person>.
This will read every message you have received from <person>.
  Read my next message. (or just next message)
This will read the next pending message.
  Compose a message to <person>.
This will compose a new short message to be delivered to <person>.
It's worth reiterating that these commands are INTRASHIP, so they will not allow the sending of messages to other ships. You can only leave messages for a person on the ship you're currently in. This does not, however, mean that you can't leave messages for people who aren't on the ship at the time. You can leave a message for any player on your ship and they can check it the next t
11:58 ime they're on board. Also worth noting is that the IQMN is a separate upgrade to the RAVEN system. You will require both a RAVEN upgrade AND an IQMN upgrade.

15:34 The Five-Person Transverser
Cost: 250,000,000.00
Point Requirement: 2300, 50
Turrets: 6
Cannons: 3
Docking bay: One
Mass: 6.0
Cargo capacity: 6500
Charge: 10 days
FTL range: 350.0 LY
Armor: No
Upgrades: Subwarp Drive, Galactic Map Unit, and Wavewarp Drive
Additional Information: The Transverser boasts the next step in propulsion technology
the wavewarp drive. Using the wavewarp technology, the starship "rides" through space using
rapidly generated energy pulses which propel the ship forward. Unfortunately (or
fortunately, depending on your purposes), this energe pulse causes a shockwave
which will damage any nearby starships or small objects. This technology is
frowned upon for regular use, as it damages anything in its path indiscriminately, but it can be a valuable tool for the explorer in a pinch. A patch is
required for the wavewarp drive to function within the NAVI system.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

16:10 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-toole

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This thin woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a midriff-bearing shimmering lavender purple silk tube top which has a sweetheart neck and has cute purple flowers along the bottom over a pale pink satin triangle bra with a gold heart-shaped front clasp. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of tight stonewashed blue low-rise jeans with purple rhinestone butterflies on the front and back pockets over a pair of pale pink satin boy shorts. She is wearing a pair of multi colored clogs on her feet. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist.

22:05 Kitty Mars releases the buckle of her seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

"The Hatch Cracker Store" printed on a sheet of paper with a stylized letterhead at the top
[07/03/2354 - 5:36 a.m.] - The Hatch Cracker Store
In order to enter the store where hatch crackers, stun batons, etc, are sold,you need a four didget code. For the code you will need the numbers which are found on the following planets:
Destination               Sector                    Coordinates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marilan                   Sector 15: Miriani        5, 3, 7
Umber                     Sector 13: Triskaideka    15, 6, 4
Hostius                   Sector 20: Tartarus       18, 7, 2
The Barren                Sector 11: Universal End  6, 6, 6
Note that the numbers must be found in this order to get the correct code.
Here's an example:
Marilan: 0
Umber: 2
Hostius: 9
The Barren: 7
the keypad says second is first, so I try:
2097: 2970: 2709! and I'm in!
Another thing to note is that the numbers you find won't always be normal numbers. Some will be Roman numerals. The next page of this book contains a chart to help you translate them if you don't know how to use Roman numerals. Remember though that the letter n means 0. An easy way to remember this is the word null. Null means nothing, or 0. N is for null.
Once you get into the store, the code will randomize itself. If you leave the store and want to get back in, you will need to repeat the proces
22:42 s again.

However, rather than act as a mothership for smaller craft, the Muzano is equipped with a large array of electronic warfare technology. While the only confirmed ability is that it is able to project an interdiction field in the same way as a Muzati, unconfirmed reports have shown it to be capable of jamming electronic systems and releasing chaff which is capable of overloading ship sensor readouts such that individual objects cannot be discerned close to the Muzano. This ship's legends are often more intimidating than its actual presence, and it is rare to see a Muzano in combat."
