00:35 ["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, and a white trash bin here.

03:12 ["Tibo" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go east, south, and west.

Roleplay Commands
--------------------------------------------------
Miriani has a number of commands available to assist you in the creation of dynamic roleplay environments and situations. These commands allow you to customize how you look, how you walk, how you act, and even arrange the items in rooms that you own. This help file will give you a brief rundown of all of these commands as well as pointers to the help files that explain the command usage in much greater detail.

  Emote
The emote command is among the most powerful and dynamic for customizing the way your character acts and reacts. It also serves as the basis for the syntax of a number of the other commands below, so it's worth learning what emote can do. Miriani uses a system known as E2 (emote 2.0) that allows you to reference people and objects in your emotes, do pronoun substitutions, randomize lists of possible actions, and even override the output of several standard commands in the game. 

To see a full list of capabilities, as well as the syntax for accomplishing them, see HELP EXTENDED EMOTES

  Room Poses
Room poses allow you to add information about what you're currently doing in a room. It will appear after your name in the room's description. For example, you may want people to see that you're leaning nonchalantly against a wall. When you set your room pose, anybody LOOKing at the room will see: 'You see Albori leaning nonchalantly against the wall here.'  Room poses aren't limited to just your character, though. You can also set room poses on objects as well.

For an exhaustive explanation of this feature, see HELP ROOM POSES

  Grouped Room Poses
Grouped room poses allow you to create a single room pose and group several objects around it. Say, for example, that you wanted some gadgets to be sitting on top of your spacesuit. You could, certainly, apply an individual room pose to each object. However, that would look cluttered and redundant: "You see a communicator sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, a destination finder sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, etc here." There is a better way!

With grouped room poses, you can create a single pose (in our example, "sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit") and then add the objects to the pose. Then you end up with: "You see a communicator, a destination finder, a message board reader, and a flight control scanner sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit here.")

For more on how to use grouped room poses, see HELP GROUPED ROOM POSES

  Sit Poses
Sit poses allow you to customize the way you're sitting on an object. You may, for instance, want to lean back in a recliner. The syntax for that would be: SIT RECLINER AS "leaning back with the footstool up"

This would appear to the room as: Albori Sninvel (leaning back with the footstool up on a well-worn blue recliner).

  Sort
If you're very 
14:06 particular about the order in which objects appear, you can use the SORT command. This works in rooms you own, containers, and even what you're wearing.

For specific instructions, see HELP SORT

  Microdetails
Microdetails are temporary lines of text that you can add to the end of your description for a preset amount of time, ranging anywhere from an hour to a week. To set your microdetails, type MICRODETAILS (or MICRO). This command is not meant to replace coded systems like clothing, makeup, or custom hair styles. Rather, it's meant to enhance those systems or to add little details about your character's current situation that you otherwise would not be able to have. You can quickly view other player's microdetail additions by typing MICROS [person] or EXTRA [person].

  Walk Styles
Walk styles allow you to customize the way your character moves from room to room. There are quite a few to choose from, which you can access via the WALK command.

Additionally, if you don't want to commit to any single style all the time, you can use temporary walk styles. Each style is also a command that you can type instead of the word GO. For example, say you want to stalk angerly into your ship. Instead of typing WALK, choosing stalk, entering your ship, and typing WALK again, you can simply type: STALK <ship name>. 

  Custom Socials
Custom socials allow you to cement an EMOTE into its own special command. This makes it like any of socials you might find in @SOCIALS (and, in fact, your custom socials will be listed in that command after you create them). 

For more information on creating custom socials, see HELP @CUSTOM-SOCIALS.

In addition, you can also create special socials that can be used over the communicator. Creating these types of socials is available from the @CUSTOM-SOCIALS menu.

For more information on how to use communicator socials, see the 'Emoting' section of HELP COMMUNICATORS.

  Emoting On Unidle
If you want to trigger an emote after you unidle, the WAKEUP-OPTIONS command is the place to set that. This is useful for people who may want to, for instance, suddenly jerk awake but are too lazy to type it themselves every time.

14:19 You are a member of the AIE alliance.
This 26 year old man stands 5 feet and 11 inches tall and is slim. He has a dark complexion. His short, black hair is wavy. He has round emerald green eyes with a straight nose above white, straight teeth. He is clean-shaven. He appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. He is surrounded by a transparent energy field.
For a top, you are wearing a red vest with 'Force' embroidered on the left breast over a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of faded blue jeans with metal studs around the back pockets over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black stun armor storage bag, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a red archaeological artifact storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a level five archaeological dig site scanner, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.
You are carrying nothing.

14:19 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

14:19 You feel a tingly sensation and notice that you are not what you were!

14:58 ["Canavara" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, three gleaming gray security drones, and a black leather crewman chair here.
You see a pigeon here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.

15:57 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a metallic red starship simulator, Mekensie the droid, and Kalista the droid here.

In the very center of the room, several differently colored fibers have been integrated into the carpet to form the logo of the Alliance High Guard, a large circle in which the three alliances are all represented. The walls of the room each represent a different alliance: The northern wall is dominated by a large logo for the Hale Collective, the eastern wall a logo for the Commonwealth of Free Spirits, and the western wall a logo for the Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists. The southern and outer wall displays three rings: indigo for AIE, cyan for Commonwealth, and gray for Hale, all connected to each other at the bottom with a single golden ring which represents the Alliance High Guard. A number of desks line the walls, providing information and services to people who seek it.

I am both an eviscerator and battlecruiser pilot, and I have fought thousands of praelor ships over my career. Until recently, we could only fight the standard combat drones using our simulators. this left us with an inaccurate representation of how real battles with Praelor ships would feel on all but the smallest of ship types. Now that we have updated software that allows the addition of up to ten different custom drone configurations, I have come up with what I believe to be accurate drone configurations to simulate Praelor ships using our simulators. It is important that we get an accurate feel for how things will be if we are going to practice for the day we have our own ships, whatever the types we might choose to use to defend our space from the Praelor Ontanka faction, and to strike aggressively at them. to that end, here is my list of drone names and configuration settings for many of the Praelor ship types. If anyone believes my settings to be in error, I invite them to come up with changes. It is important that pilots of all alliances work together.
