["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

12:25 ["Starlight Express" Living Quarters 1] (indoors) (lying on a beech wood king-size pillow-top bed with a blue soft patchwork quilt and fluffy pillows)
You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a small white oak wood bedside table, a beech wood king-size pillow-top bed with a blue soft patchwork quilt and fluffy pillows, a high white oak wood nightstand, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, an elegant cherry wood mirror, a white wicker wardrobe, a pair of brown leather tennis shoes, and a pair of translucent white wooden platform shoes with lavender accents on them here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

14:39 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:39 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

14:39 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

14:39 (Storage Room) You watch as a salvaging line deposits a cloud of interstellar dust onto the ground nearby.

14:39 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a cloud of interstellar dust."

14:41 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

14:41 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

14:42 #$#soundpack_lag 121

14:42 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:42 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

14:42 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

14:42 (Storage Room) You watch as a salvaging line deposits a chunk of nickel onto the ground nearby.

14:42 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a chunk of nickel."

14:42 You flick a switch to enable condensed autopilot and debris display modes.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical d
14:58 rone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a commodity listing here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

14:58 Katrianne Beauchene deftly inserts a hollow cylindrical device into a High Guard-issue rifle holster.

14:58 For a top, you are wearing a thick burgundy fleece pullover. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of black jeans with metal studs around the back pockets over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, an antique gold wedding band engraved with intertwining hearts, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface.

14:58 You are carrying nothing.

14:58 Katrianne Beauchene retrieves her armor from a pink armor storage bag and puts it on.

14:58 Katrianne Beauchene removes her armor and neatly places it in a pink armor storage bag.

14:58 Katrianne Beauchene slides her feet into a pair of translucent white wooden platform shoes with lavender accents on them.

15:08 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:08 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

15:08 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

15:08 (Storage Room) You watch as a salvaging line deposits a chunk of nickel onto the ground nearby.

15:08 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a chunk of nickel."

15:17 (Storage Room) You watch as a salvaging line deposits a cloud of interstellar dust onto the ground nearby.

15:17 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a cloud of interstellar dust."

16:23 Blast Door Tripwires
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Tripwires, although technologically dissimilar to their name, do what you might expect: When a blast door begins to get compromised, they will be activated and trigger an alert.
  Use
You're able to purchase a single tripwire per door and, BE WARNED, the only way to remove one is to remove the entire door. So choose very carefully. There are, as of writing, three styles of tripwire to choose from:
    Basic: Initiates an intruder alert, notifying the entire ship of danger and flagging the person as an intruder.
    Communicative: Pings the communicator of whoever bought it, notifying only the owner of danger.
    Advanced: Both initiates an intruder alert and pings the communicator of whoever bought it, notifying both of danger.
Tripwires only need to be purchased once per door. Repairing doors does not affect them. If you remove a door, you also remove any tripwires. They are activated immediately upon the blast door being cut into. 
NOTE: If the person cutting the door has a key to the ship, they will NOT be flagged as an intruder. However, intruder alert will still be triggered to notify the ship that something is afoot.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.

18:37 Active Starship
--------------------------------------------------
An active starship is, essentially, the starship you are currently using. When you set a starship as active, it will become the default choice in most prompts that ask you to choose a starship. Such prompts may include: Repair stores, mission assignment, and some upgrade stores.
Be sure to unset your active ship when you're done, as it could have unintended consequences if you forget about it and mean to select another ship. The hosts are not responsible for accidents that may occur because you forgot you had an active ship set and accidentally bought something for the wrong ship.
You will need to have a key to a ship to make it active.

The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator
20:20 , three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a commodity listing here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

20:20 You flick a switch to disable condensed autopilot and debris display modes.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.
