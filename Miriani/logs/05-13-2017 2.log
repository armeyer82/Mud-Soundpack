00:26:09 a Tardick lizard named Asteria

00:26:09 This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

00:53:04 Evenia Callseah closes a metallic gold messenger bag.

00:53:09 Damien Goss says in a Malagasy accent, "Just so everyone knows the scheduling for the home station falling."

00:53:10 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I doubt that would be anyone here, no cans."

00:53:10 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "The beacon back home is about 8 hours ahead of this station."

00:53:20 Evenia says to Bryan, "I hate you. All those threads."

00:53:26 Damien Goss waves.

00:53:32 Hakeem Oiadip waves to Damien Goss.

00:53:32 Damien Goss steps down.

00:53:54 Johann Schraft glances at a power readout.

00:53:59 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Let's do midnight then."

00:54:07 You nod.

00:54:08 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I can do whenever."

00:54:38 Evenia says to Morris, "If we both end up on defense. You take engineering if you like. Since you haven't got to engineer one of these."

00:54:48 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah. "Sure."

00:54:57 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I will bring a ship and make off-color comments in the can sector."

00:55:00 Hakeem Oiadip takes a sip of a cool pint of Marzore Dark.

00:55:04 Morris Corlew grins.

00:55:06 You grin.

00:55:14 Hakeem says to Johann, "Launch a beacon."

00:55:21 "You? Make off-colored comments?" Evenia Callseah gasps at Johann Schraft.

00:55:27 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I'd prefer to gun but yeah."

00:55:27 Johann Schraft exclaims in a German accent, "A very high hammerhead!"

00:55:31 Bryan Stout chuckles at Johann Schraft.

00:55:33 Hakeem Oiadip nods to Johann Schraft.

00:55:35 Bryan says to Johann, "Do it I'm in."

00:55:50 Johann says to Bryan, "Oh, no, let's do it in the frigate."

00:56:02 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "We'll do it tomorrow."

00:56:07 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Screw that. If you're gonna go all out anyway, overdriven in the hammerhead and a nice quick trip home."

00:56:11 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "It will be tomorrow in an hour."

00:56:12 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I would like to throw out a beacon to see what response we get."

00:56:19 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Back when this first came up, there had been some talk about putting a BAS down here."

00:56:49 Bryan Stout nods.

00:56:50 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I will launch a beacon in my transport."

00:56:57 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Decided not to as we might attract somebody other than IFS and Outsiders."

00:57:03 Evenia Callseah exclaims in an Ars Magnan accent, "Capsule beacons!"

00:57:07 You grin.

00:57:10 Morris says to Evenia, "Undercrewed."

00:57:15 You exclaim, "Go capsules!"

00:57:16 Evenia Callseah laughs at Morris Corlew.

00:57:19 You chuckle.

00:57:20 Morris Corlew grins.

00:57:23 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Talk to what's his face Fringe guy about that."

00:57:29 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "Hmm?"

00:57:31 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "The undercrewed capsule beacons."

00:57:37 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Who?"

00:57:46 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "What fringe guy had an undercrewed capsule?"

00:57:49 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "The idiot that flew his ship down here empty."

00:57:52 Bryan Stout laughs.

00:57:54 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Gonzo."

00:57:58 Johann Schraft chuckles.

00:57:59 Evenia Callseah nods.

00:58:03 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

00:58:05 Vernos Bailey strolls in from below followed by Nissi Valdaire.

00:58:05 You chuckle.

00:58:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

00:58:06 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Evenia Callseah's neck.

00:58:08 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I'm sorry, but that's kind of funny."

00:58:09 Vernos Bailey disbands his group.

00:58:13 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Stupid, but hilarious."

00:58:24 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a beige sofa.

00:58:33 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I'm more along the lines of completely fuckin' stupid."

00:58:39 Morris Corlew looks at Vernos Bailey thoughtfully.

00:58:40 Vernos Bailey asks in a neutral accent, "So Op?"

00:58:48 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Hmm. No bruises. Guess he didn't hit on her."

00:58:50 Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire.

00:58:51 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "Midnightish it semms."

00:59:07 Hakeem Oiadip takes a sip of a cool pint of Marzore Dark.

00:59:23 Vernos Bailey nods to Hakeem Oiadip.

00:59:44 Rogue says to Hakeem, "No response I gather?"

00:59:56 Hakeem says to Rogue, "Nope, just talked to him."

01:00:11 Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "Talked to who?"

01:00:19 Hakeem says to Rogue, "Gonzo."

01:00:28 Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "And?"

01:00:43 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "What a guy."

01:01:17 Hakeem says to Rogue, "He said he did it, he didnt think it was riky. Also we talked about being SDC, let him know I may run again if he is the only candidate."

01:01:41 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "And he couldnt explain what he gained doing it."

01:01:50 Evenia Callseah furrows her brow.

01:01:56 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I know what he gained."

01:02:04 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "It was just because he could."

01:02:09 Bryan Stout shrugs.

01:02:15 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Faster trip. Didn't have to wait on the slower ship."

01:02:16 Hakeem says to Morris, "Besides the obvious reaction, what?"

01:02:17 Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "He didn't think it risky?"

01:02:22 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

01:02:24 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Stupid."

01:02:27 Vernos says to Morris, "The image of being ignorate."

01:02:32 Hakeem says to Morris, "And that gained him what?"

01:02:34 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I think we all agree."

01:02:36 Morris says to Hakeem, "Time."

01:02:42 Hakeem Oiadip asks in a Chetumal accent, "For what?"

01:02:57 Morris says to Hakeem, "If you didn't have a capsule would you go home as much?"

01:03:01 Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "Being on his own?"

01:03:03 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "He says he was here to wait for the ship, so he had what, one hour to socialize."

01:03:07 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I'm not defending the guy."

01:03:28 Vernos says to Morris, "Time is no excuse, I did five hours in the rift."

01:03:44 Morris says to Hakeem, "Two things...one, yeah, he could get here and didn't have to spend time by himself. Two, to see if he could get it to work I guess."

01:03:44 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "It was unoccupied. He did not think of risk it bein' boarded, stolen, shot down.."

01:03:45 Hakeem says to Morris, "I understand it, I know he gained time, but time do what? We should also measure risky against gain."

01:03:52 Morris says to Vernos, "And I agree. I'm sayin that's his reason."

01:03:57 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "Which makes things worse."

01:03:58 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "If it was accepted practice, I'd put my carrier with the transport in it out there in the rift and send it home, while I went home in the capsule. But that's not the way we do things."

01:04:00 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I wouldn't pop home for half a day like I do now, of course, but you make sure you have a capsule."

01:04:00 Morris says to Hakeem, "Don't ask me. Ask him that."

01:04:09 Hakeem says to Morris, "I did."

01:04:23 Johann Schraft asks in a German accent, "What happens if the rift drive breaks down?"

01:04:35 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I think that ship might not have a drive."

01:04:38 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Using the inserter."

01:04:38 Hakeem says to Johann, "He doesn't have a rift in the tboat."

01:04:41 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "One of the many reasons why that's not the way we do things."

01:04:44 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Yeah."

01:04:49 Rogue Romano nods.

01:04:49 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "What happens if his ship gets pulled out of the rift, and then taken?"

01:04:56 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Ahh well, then a snowglobe can come take it away."

01:04:57 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Exactly."

01:04:57 Hakeem Oiadip nods to Evenia Callseah.

01:05:01 Morris Corlew grins at Johann Schraft.

01:05:04 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

01:05:08 Hakeem says to Evenia, "Being taken is worse than destroyed."

01:05:15 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Much."

01:05:21 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Much much worse."

01:05:26 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "And that is what having someone in makes a difference."

01:05:31 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Yep."

01:05:34 Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "A fucking torp boat too?"

01:05:38 Morris Corlew nods to Ted Warburton.

01:05:39 Hakeem Oiadip nods to Ted Warburton.

01:05:41 Evenia Callseah nods to Ted Warburton.

01:05:44 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I had to take him over to it in my roid hauler."

01:05:48 Rogue Romano nods and nods.

01:05:51 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "You didn't have to."

01:05:53 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "And he came in here all proud and excited coz he thought he was awesome for doing it."

01:06:12 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I don't think he was by the time he left."

01:06:15 Morris says to Nicolette, "Kinda did. You really want somethin to happen to it?"

01:06:15 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "He claimed he saved it. With mention of Morris's help."

01:06:21 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "He used the term lynched."

01:06:24 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Without mention."

01:06:26 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Heh."

01:06:33 Ted Warburton sighs.

01:06:43 Jason Rat asks in a North American accent, "He hasn't been back here sense he did it, right?"

01:06:43 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Without Morris's help, it'd be still sitting up there."

01:06:46 Hakeem Oiadip takes a sip of a cool pint of Marzore Dark.

01:06:50 Bryan Stout grins.

01:06:51 Morris says to Hakeem, "Wait, he's sayin folks lynched him? For tellin him he did somethin dumb?"

01:06:54 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "What?"

01:07:00 I don't understand that.

01:07:04 Morris says to Evenia, "Nah. We've had pirates a few tiems since then."

01:07:05 Nicolette says to Jason, "He's been around a little."

01:07:05 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Times."

01:07:06 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Nothing bad happened to him, it was all words."

01:07:08 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "He has, he was taking ships back home, figure he is ALis org."

01:07:12 Hakeem Oiadip nods to Morris Corlew.

01:07:28 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "Gotcha."

01:07:42 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "We just all told him what we thought."

01:07:44 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "It woulda been gone. Blown up or stolen."

01:07:52 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I have not seen him here since I been back, and I left shortly after Hakeem once the report was sent in."

01:07:57 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "But definitely not still up there."

01:07:59 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Never take risks with beacons like these."

01:08:15 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I heard him broken on comms."

01:08:25 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "Well, broken comms."

01:08:37 Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:08:40 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Yeah, I saw him at home before I came back here."

01:08:55 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I don't want to run again, but I will if there is no one else."

01:08:58 Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "Are any of his ships still here?"

01:09:03 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:09:04 Morris Corlew stands up from a beige sofa.

01:09:04 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "You won't have to if there's no one else."

01:09:07 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Well."

01:09:09 Morris Corlew lopes down.

01:09:11 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "Full dive."

01:09:14 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "That may not be true, you guys do things differently."

01:09:29 Hakeem says to Nicolette, "He will run."

01:09:31 Evenia says to Hakeem, "That's Ali's."

01:09:40 Hakeem says to Evenia, "Ali or alis org?"

01:09:51 Morris Corlew lopes in from below.

01:09:53 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

01:09:55 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I think he mentioned something about it."

01:09:57 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Don't see any that would be his."

01:10:03 Morris Corlew sits down on a beige sofa.

01:10:06 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Jason Rat's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:10:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

01:10:10 Hakeem Oiadip finishes off a cool pint of Marzore Dark.

01:10:15 Hakeem Oiadip puts a glass in a small natural golden brown trash bin.

01:10:36 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:10:37 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I haven't seen him in a couple of days, but I did...maybe later the same day the thing happened, he didn't just take right off and go home."

01:10:51 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "But no I haven't seen him most recently."

01:10:52 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I saw him on the comm when I was home yesterday afternoon."

01:10:54 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "He didn't seem to see why we had a problem with it."

01:10:58 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Hey, I know, shall I send my carrier with my transport in it back then fly back in my capsule? Like, leave my two most valuable ships on their own to be taken? I think that would be such a great idea, not."

01:11:09 You say, "Wow."

01:11:20 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "So, there is nothing more painful than going to sit in your nice comfortable captain's chair and finding your unicorn felo is lying there horn sticking up."

01:11:28 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:11:28 You say, "Ouch."

01:11:33 Rogue Romano smirks.

01:11:33 Morris Corlew laughs.

01:11:33 You laugh.

01:11:33 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "No comment."

01:11:34 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Oww."

01:11:45 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "Ah, I got another glowing felo and a bobtailed one."

01:11:49 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "If anyone wants."

01:11:50 "Um, there's no non-perverted way to say this." Evenia Callseah laughs at Johann Schraft. "How's your butt?"

01:11:58 Hakeem Oiadip grins at Evenia Callseah.

01:12:01 Rogue Romano asks in a Ticulian accent, "What color is the glowin'?"

01:12:04 Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "Why did I feel like you said blowing felo for a minute there?"

01:12:09 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Hopefully he was wearin pants..."

01:12:09 Hakeem says to Rogue, "Violet I think."

01:12:10 Johann says to Evenia, "Want to check it for me? I can't turn my head that far."

01:12:19 Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:12:28 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I'm lookin' for dark red."

01:12:41 Evenia says to Bryan, "Johann needs a butt check."

01:12:43 Hakeem says to Rogue, "I will check when I am back home."

01:12:48 Rogue Romano nods to Hakeem Oiadip.

01:12:52 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "All mine will eat you."

01:13:04 Rogue says to Ted, "You can keep 'em."

01:13:08 Hakeem says to Rogue, "I have red and light red soldiers, but never dark red."

01:13:08 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:13:27 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Dark red exist, but aren't common."

01:13:32 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I've seen one or two."

01:13:37 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "I have a few dark red I think."

01:13:48 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I used to have dark red glowing."

01:13:54 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Almost all of mine are indigo these days."

01:13:55 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "With black glowing."

01:14:11 Evenia Callseah beams. "Indigo."

01:14:17 Morris Corlew exclaims in an Appalachian accent, "Maggie!"

01:14:19 Ted says to Evenia, "It's your fault."

01:14:32 Bryan Stout smirks.

01:14:33 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I probably need to get mix new genes."

01:14:40 Evenia says to Ted, "It so is noOkay, yeah it is."

01:14:50 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "That's what I tried, but the indigos took over."

01:15:01 Evenia Callseah exclaims in an Ars Magnan accent, "Indigo power!"

01:15:03 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Interesting. They're not generally that dominant."

01:15:07 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Right, I'm going to try and be back by midnight."

01:15:12 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "But I need a bit of a nap."

01:15:12 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "These ones are."

01:15:15 You wave to Bryan Stout.

01:15:17 Bryan Stout waves.

01:15:17 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Later."

01:15:19 Bryan Stout scrambles to his feet.

01:15:19 Bryan Stout ambles down.

01:15:19 Morris Corlew nods to Ted Warburton.

01:15:30 Morris says to Ted, "How big a ship?"

01:15:38 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Mod transport."

01:15:42 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Ah."

01:15:53 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "No idea how many that'll hold. But might try tradin out 5 or 6."

01:16:02 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Needed a cheap ship for felo, and figured it might come in useful one day."

01:16:03 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "That might put enough new genes in."

01:16:06 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Probably the same as a mule."

01:16:12 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:16:19 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Similar."

01:16:21 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I dunno...they can spread out to those living quarters."

01:16:24 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Is it?"

01:16:27 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

01:16:31 Johann says to Ted, "IF you ever use it, make sure there are no felo in the bay before you open it."

01:16:40 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "You get a few in the quarters, so probably a few more."

01:16:45 Morris Corlew nods.

01:16:48 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I did that, the other day."

01:16:57 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "If it were me. I'd hunt other colored mean felo. Any color. Then trim out maybe 5 or 6 of the felo in the ship. And add those guys in."

01:17:08 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah. "That's what I was sayin."

01:17:19 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I got rid of a few earlier, let's see what I have when I get back."

01:17:41 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "They'll all be indigo. I cursed the ship. Indigo power will live on."

01:17:44 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Gotta add some in for new genes. Just gettin rid of 'em will strengthen the current gene pool even more."

01:17:50 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Not all indigo, just mostly."

01:18:13 Johann Schraft says in a German accent, "Right. Be back in a bit."

01:18:15 Johann Schraft stands up from a beige sofa.

01:18:16 Johann Schraft waves frantically!

01:18:21 Evenia Callseah hugs Johann Schraft.

01:18:21 Johann Schraft walks down.

01:18:23 Johann Schraft walks in from below.

01:18:24 Johann Schraft hugs Evenia Callseah.

01:18:25 Johann Schraft walks down.

01:18:28 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Actually, same, definitely want to be on the op though."

01:18:31 Hakeem Oiadip presses a button next to a speaker.

01:18:31 Hakeem Oiadip says into the PA, "Good butt check."

01:18:33 Ted Warburton stands up from a beige sofa.

01:18:34 Ted Warburton walks down.

01:18:37 Morris Corlew smirks at Hakeem Oiadip.

01:18:40 Evenia Callseah grins.

01:18:53 Morris Corlew glances down at his sleek silver watch with diamond accents momentarily.

01:19:00 Hakeem says to Morris, "Eve just asked Bryan to do it and the two of them leave almost at the same time."

01:19:05 Morris says to Hakeem, "I know."

01:19:10 Morris Corlew grins.

01:19:11 Hakeem Oiadip absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

01:19:19 Evenia Callseah giggles.

01:19:26 Nissi Valdaire asks in a Centaurian accent, "We all talking about leaving soon? Or just some people?"

01:19:41 Hakeem says to Nissi, "There are two cans left."

01:19:42 Evenia says to Nissi, "There's only 2 cans left, so we've been talking about leaving after that."

01:19:42 Morris says to Nissi, "Two more cans left."

01:19:44 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "After all the cans are gone."

01:19:49 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Ooh."

01:19:53 Morris Corlew nods.

01:20:00 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Yeah that'll be 30 ops, right? Not bad."

01:20:04 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "25."

01:20:09 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Good enough."

01:20:09 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I tried to get thm to redo the stations and make it a month long event."

01:20:12 Morris Corlew nods.

01:20:16 Evenia Callseah grins at Vernos Bailey.

01:20:16 Nissi Valdaire grins.

01:20:17 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Gee, unbelieveable how fast we went through all those ops."

01:20:21 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "I think people would get sick of it."

01:20:22 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I have been in 9, that was an interesting experience."

01:20:25 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Mmhmm. Been a week."

01:20:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

01:20:38 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "25 ops in one week..."

01:20:39 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Might keep the beacons up though, would make it easier to repeat this once we get the urge again."

01:20:46 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "As I said yesterday. If anyone suggests an op after we get back for like a month, I will scream."

01:20:53 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

01:20:58 Kim Saunders giggles.

01:21:02 Vernos says to Evenia, "I was just going to suggest breakfast."

01:21:04 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I do not think they will."

01:21:06 A Tardick lizard named Thor curls its tail loosely around Jason Rat's neck.

01:21:09 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I already heard something about an artifact trip."

01:21:24 "I like that idea." Evenia Callseah nods to Nissi Valdaire. "Libs would be willing to help out there if needed."

01:21:27 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I would like that, but yeah, we need a break."

01:21:27 You say to Evenia, "Op, a couple of days after we get ack?"

01:21:33 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Cool."

01:21:35 Jason Rat asks in a North American accent, "This time not let the Mutey pilots to let the pirates not come?"

01:21:58 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Mostly we'd want a rotation of people rebuilding the beacons so that no one person has to give up their day to do it too often."

01:21:59 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "Hey Shule?"

01:21:59 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "And I'm still waking up."

01:22:14 Evenia says to Nissi, "We could help with that."

01:22:19 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

01:22:19 Hakeem says to Nissi, "I am more of willing to if someone teaches me how."

01:22:25 Nissi Valdaire nods to Evenia Callseah and smiles.

01:22:33 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Okay."

01:22:56 Evenia says to you in an Ars Magnan accent, "No. Simply...No. I'd rather do an overdriven tandem cruiser beacon."

01:23:02 Morris says to Nissi, "Station building and the rift are both relaxing to me, so just lemme know and I'd be happy to help."

01:23:08 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

01:23:13 Morris says to Evenia, "10 seconds."

01:23:18 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "The rift, relaxing?"

01:23:22 Morris Corlew nods to Kim Saunders.

01:23:36 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Evenia Callseah's shoulder.

01:23:36 Morris says to Kim, "Yes, I know. I'm weird."

01:23:39 Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew. "Exactly. But not an op."

01:23:47 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, I guess we all have different things we call relaxing."

01:23:51 You say, "Not with my cruiser."

01:23:59 Morris says to Evenia, "I'd rather do an op than those awful 10 seconds in one of them cruisers."

01:24:01 Morris Corlew nods to Kim Saunders.

01:24:20 Evenia says to you in an Ars Magnan accent, "Well. It was you that suggested the op. So I think we'll take yours. And we'll sacrifice Johann's."

01:24:29 Morris Corlew laughs.

01:24:32 You chuckle.

01:24:34 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Just don't put mine in the mix."

01:24:39 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I'm goin' to lie down for a bit. Take a lil' nap. Give me a holla when gettin' ready to set up op."

01:24:44 Rogue Romano stands up from a beige sofa.

01:24:45 You wave to Rogue Romano.

01:24:47 You hug Rogue Romano.

01:24:53 You say to Rogue, "Rest well."

01:24:54 Rogue Romano hugs you.

01:24:55 Morris Corlew waves to Rogue Romano.

01:24:57 Rogue Romano nods.

01:24:57 Kim Saunders smiles at Rogue Romano.

01:25:01 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Will do."

01:25:05 Rogue Romano waves.

01:25:07 Rogue Romano slinks down.

01:25:31 Evenia Callseah strokes a Tardick lizard named Zeus's warm scaly skin.

01:25:38 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "We need an super-extra-large controller. 50 cans."

01:25:39 Evenia says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus in an Ars Magnan accent, "Havin' fun up there?"

01:25:53 Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew. "Now that would be cool."

01:26:02 Morris Corlew laughs at Evenia Callseah.

01:26:08 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Or one of those million unit cans I've heard tell of."

01:26:10 Morris says to Evenia, "25 cans has ya nutty and you think 50'd be cool?"

01:26:17 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah.

01:26:22 Morris says to Evenia, "Those take awhile to fill."

01:26:31 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Pretty much have to have 3 salvagers."

01:26:36 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Or 4."

01:26:38 "Well sure." Evenia Callseah nods to Morris Corlew. "Because we'd be able to space 'em out a little more, and make an even bigger thing of it."

01:26:40 Morris Corlew nods.

01:26:46 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I got ignored."

01:26:48 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Well, I mean 3 absolutely minimum."

01:26:49 Vernos Bailey laughs.

01:26:51 You grin.

01:26:54 Melinda says to Vernos, "5."

01:26:55 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "Anybody hear somethin?"

01:27:02 Kim says to Vernos, "With what?"

01:27:14 Vernos says to Kim, "Oh I made a comment to Evenia."

01:27:15 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "Who just said what?"

01:27:19 Evenia rubs at her ears.

01:27:43 Evenia says to Vernos, "Oh, I honestly didn't hear you."

01:27:48 Vernos Bailey laughs.

01:28:10 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "It is okay, as a cadet I am quite irrelevant."

01:28:22 You say to Vernos, "Awww, not true."

01:28:31 Morris says to Vernos, "No. As AEU you're..."

01:28:33 Evenia says to Vernos, "That isn't true. I just missed what you said. I'm sorry dude."

01:28:34 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

01:28:34 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I was quite irrelevant as a cadet. And still am."

01:28:40 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "ANd that's okay."

01:28:42 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "No comment."

01:28:45 Morris Corlew laughs.

01:28:59 Hakeem Oiadip grins.

01:29:04 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "Who is that Nicolette person, anyway?"

01:29:11 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Hey, I'm still irrelevant."

01:29:18 You say, "So am I."

01:29:19 Nicolette says to Melinda in a California accent, "I was quiet and didn't bother anybody at all until you kept bugging me and bugging me."

01:29:20 Vernos says to Evenia, "Oh I said I would not want another op after doing 12 of 25 up here."

01:29:28 Vernos says to Evenia, "But I would not mind breakfast."

01:29:30 Melinda says to Nicolette, "Boy did I fuck up."

01:29:36 Morris Corlew laughs at Melinda Michaels.

01:29:37 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "You did."

01:29:40 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Royally."

01:29:42 Evenia Callseah grins at Vernos Bailey. "Well, go get some."

01:30:00 Evenia says to Melinda in an Ars Magnan accent, "It's all your fault. I will forever blame you for letting her out."

01:30:05 Vernos says to Evenia, "I offered to let you join."

01:30:29 "Thanks, but I'm honestly not hungry right now." Evenia Callseah smiles at Vernos Bailey. "I appreciate the offer though."

01:30:47 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Alright so, lets do these ops."

01:31:01 You grin.

01:31:02 Vernos Bailey glances down at his tasteful gold watch with diamond accents momentarily.

01:31:06 You say, "I'm ready whenever."

01:31:19 Evenia Callseah glances down at her glossy obsidian wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

01:31:20 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "That way we can all go home."

01:31:20 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Here if ya need crew."

01:31:34 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "The longer we wait, the more sleepy I will be."

01:31:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on your shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:31:36 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I tried to go home a while ago, but the flow was terrible."

01:31:38 Morris says to Vernos, "Homesick?"

01:31:46 You nod to Kim Saunders.

01:31:49 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "So you're all stuck with me."

01:31:54 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Damn."

01:31:55 Vernos says to Morris, "Nope."

01:31:56 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Irrelevant though I may be."

01:32:01 You say to Kim, "We'll just tickle you to death until you wake up."

01:32:06 Kim Saunders grins.

01:32:10 Vernos Bailey asks in a neutral accent, "So defense?"

01:32:13 Morris says to you in an Appalachian accent, "You'll clean it up if she wets herself too."

01:32:17 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I'm totally in for that."

01:32:18 You chuckle.

01:32:21 You say, "Defense."

01:32:24 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, I think the flow might encourage us to stay until tomorrow."

01:32:26 Morris says to Vernos, "Kim wettin herself?"

01:32:35 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I'm a bit on the tired side. So you'd be better having me gun. If I'm needed."

01:32:36 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Jason Rat's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:32:54 You say, "I can fly, gun, or even engineer."

01:32:55 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I would like to defend to be 5 and 5."

01:32:57 Vernos says to Morris, "Watch it or I'll have to feed you to the fishes."

01:33:05 Morris says to Vernos, "Riiiiight."

01:33:12 Evenia says to you in an Ars Magnan accent, "You can fly? Really? Where are your wings hidden?"

01:33:15 Evenia Callseah looks at you thoughtfully.

01:33:18 Kim Saunders laughs.

01:33:29 Morris says to you in an Appalachian accent, "Salvage."

01:33:30 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Ug, I guess that means I end up on Salvage this time."

01:33:32 Vernos says to Morris, "Or the hungry fel0."

01:33:32 You say to Evenia, "I try. Theough last time I jumped off a building, it didn't work so well."

01:33:34 Vernos says to Morris, "Or the hungry felo."

01:33:38 Morris Corlew smirks at Vernos Bailey.

01:34:06 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I don't know why so many hate to salvage. I've salvaged all but one I've done since we got here, it would be nice to do something different, but I do whatever."

01:34:17 Vernos Bailey asks in a neutral accent, "So shue, morris and hakeem for defense?"

01:34:20 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Hmm...outta uh..."

01:34:23 Vernos Bailey asks in a neutral accent, "Did I hear that right?"

01:34:36 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Evenia Callseah's shoulder.

01:34:39 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "13 ops? I've salvaged uh...9?"

01:34:50 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I don't hate salvaging. We all know that. I'm just a little tired. So it's probably not the best idea to have me do it on this op."

01:34:51 Nicolette Lawrence nods to Morris Corlew. "You salvage a lot as well."

01:34:54 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "So many folks don't wanna salvage."

01:34:55 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I can also sit out, if someone wants to go."

01:34:55 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I do not hate salvaging. I am just not as fast as some might like."

01:34:57 You nod to Vernos Bailey.

01:35:13 Nicolette says to Kim, "Ordinarily, I'm about as slow as they come. People can wait or not, their choice."

01:35:15 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I like salvaging, I just like more defending, and there is more people to talk."

01:35:24 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "If there is no salvager I can."

01:35:37 Morris Corlew glances down at his sleek silver watch with diamond accents momentarily.

01:35:56 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I got lucky earlier and ran into a bunch of comets, and very little iron and lead in the asteroids to have to be dealt with."

01:36:10 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "It's very rare that I get done first."

01:36:14 Hakeem Oiadip stands up from a beige sofa.

01:36:15 Hakeem Oiadip slinks down.

01:36:20 Morris Corlew chuckles.

01:36:21 Hakeem Oiadip slinks in from below.

01:36:22 Hakeem Oiadip sits down on a beige sofa.

01:36:27 Hakeem Oiadip takes a sip of a cool pint of Marzore Dark.

01:36:39 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Made me think of Joel bettin me Nicolette'd be the first one done salvagin on an op."

01:37:04 Ted Warburton walks in from below.

01:37:08 Ted Warburton sits down on a beige sofa.

01:37:09 You wave to Ted Warburton.

01:37:14 Kim Saunders waves.

01:37:16 Ted Warburton waves.

01:37:24 Evenia Callseah sighs. "I thought we got rid of you."

01:37:31 Morris says to Evenia, "Try harder."

01:37:31 Hakeem Oiadip nods to Evenia Callseah.

01:37:32 You poke Evenia Callseah in the ribs!

01:37:35 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Nope, you'll never get rid of me."

01:37:36 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:37:41 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Dangit."

01:37:44 Kim Saunders grins.

01:37:47 You grin.

01:37:54 The Evil Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I will try, and keep trying."

01:37:56 The Evil Evenia Callseah cackles!

01:37:57 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "No escape from the Ted."

01:38:02 You chuckle.

01:38:03 Morris Corlew shudders.

01:38:06 Hakeem Oiadip grins at Kim Saunders.

01:38:10 Ted says to Evenia, "I will take up your entire life then."

01:38:19 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "So who was puttin this op together?"

01:38:21 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "Someone, save me?"

01:38:25 You say to Ted, "Is that a promise or a threat?"

01:38:27 Morris says to Evenia, "No."

01:38:29 Vernos says to Evenia, "Alright, this way."

01:38:29 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:38:34 Evenia Callseah pouts at Morris Corlew.

01:38:41 Morris Corlew grins at Evenia Callseah.

01:38:58 Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "I dunno, who's running this thing?"

01:39:13 Evenia says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus in an Ars Magnan accent, "Are you running the op? If so, call your crew."

01:39:21 Lily Kaise glides in from below.

01:39:24 Vernos says to Evenia, "I can run it by name."

01:39:24 You wave to Lily Kaise.

01:39:27 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:39:28 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:39:29 Nissi Valdaire exclaims in a Centaurian accent, "I can salvage!"

01:39:30 Hakeem Oiadip waves to Lily Kaise.

01:39:33 Kim Saunders waves to Lily Kaise.

01:39:33 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "But I don't have a can or hauler."

01:39:34 Hakeem Oiadip grins at Nissi Valdaire.

01:39:37 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:39:40 You carefully remove a Tardick lizard named Asteria from your shoulder.

01:39:42 Lily Kaise waves and waves and waves.

01:39:44 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Looks like we'll have enough without me."

01:39:45 You give a Tardick lizard named Asteria to Lily Kaise.

01:39:47 Ted Warburton waves to Lily Kaise.

01:39:56 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

01:39:59 Lily Kaise pets you on the head.

01:40:01 Lily Kaise grins.

01:40:04 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

01:40:04 You grin.

01:40:09 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I can do either defense or salvage."

01:40:13 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Same."

01:40:16 You say, "Ok, if no one is organizing this op. I can."

01:40:20 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Defense."

01:40:22 Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "Do I have to fix you all again?"

01:40:27 Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.

01:40:28 Nicolette Lawrence nods to Melinda Michaels.

01:40:29 Vernos says to Melinda in a neutral accent, "Please."

01:40:30 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'd like to go if there's room."

01:40:32 You grin at Melinda Michaels.

01:40:34 Evenia says to Melinda in an Ars Magnan accent, "Fix me. I beg."

01:40:41 Hakeem says to Melinda in a Chetumal accent, "Always."

01:40:43 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Damn, Eve, get out of my head."

01:40:45 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:40:47 Morris says to Evenia, "Didn't Miss Nina do that already?"

01:40:47 Vernos says to Melinda in a neutral accent, "I offered to lead it but I have no hauler or can."

01:40:48 Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:40:48 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

01:41:03 Evenia Callseah laughs.

01:41:03 Lily says to Melinda in a New Earth accent, "I'm not fixable."

01:41:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:41:09 Melinda says to Lily, "We know."

01:41:10 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

01:41:11 Morris says to Lily, "We know."

01:41:11 Morris Corlew grins.

01:41:12 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:41:15 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:41:20 Kim Saunders giggles.

01:41:26 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Hmm."

01:41:31 You say, "Ok, raise hands for defense."

01:41:33 You say, "Go."

01:41:38 Lily raises her hand.

01:41:39 Ted raises his hand.

01:41:41 Evenia raises her hand and waggles it in the air.

01:41:41 Hakeem raises his hand.

01:41:45 Vernos raises his hand.

01:41:51 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I would, but."

01:41:52 You say, "That's six so far."

01:41:52 Nicolette Lawrence shrugs.

01:42:00 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I said I'll do either."

01:42:17 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I'll either fly or engineer if needed."

01:42:25 Melinda Michaels stands up from a beige sofa.

01:42:26 Melinda Michaels holds Ted Warburton's hand, taking him into her group.

01:42:29 Melinda Michaels holds Evenia Callseah's hand, taking her into her group.

01:42:32 Melinda Michaels holds your hand, taking you into her group.

01:42:34 Hakeem Oiadip stands up from a beige sofa.

01:42:35 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'd like to engineer but I keep getting booted."

01:42:38 You say, "Salvagers go."

01:42:38 Melinda Michaels holds Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into her group.

01:42:40 You stand up from a beige sofa.

01:42:46 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Because you refuse to do anything else."

01:42:46 You ask, "Who all is salvaging?"

01:42:48 Nissi Valdaire stands up from a beige sofa.

01:42:52 Kim Saunders stands up from a beige sofa.

01:42:55 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I will salvage."

01:42:56 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "I will. If there's room."

01:42:59 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Morris, Nissi and Kim."

01:43:01 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That isn't true I've only engineered two times this time."

01:43:02 Vernos says to Melinda in a neutral accent, "Got me?"

01:43:02 Melinda Michaels holds Nicolette Lawrence's hand, taking her into her group.

01:43:04 You say, "One more."

01:43:08 Nicolette Lawrence stands up from a beige sofa.

01:43:10 Hakeem Oiadip asks in a Chetumal accent, "Me?"

01:43:11 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Oh um."

01:43:12 You say, "Salvager, Nissi and Kim already counted."

01:43:22 Hakeem Oiadip says in a Chetumal accent, "I am out, no problem."

01:43:23 Hakeem Oiadip sits down on a beige sofa.

02:14:13 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

02:14:16 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Rift Accelerating Repairing Nuclear Autonav Station.

02:14:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:14:23 Melinda Michaels presses some buttons on the communication board.

02:14:23 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "who is doing a beacon?"

02:14:32 You grin at Melinda Michaels.

02:14:32 You hear a sharp clank from the hull somewhere near you.

02:14:36 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Idiots."

02:14:40 You exclaim, "No kidding!"

02:14:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:14:44 You begin the docking sequence.

02:14:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

02:14:57 You hear a loud bang above you somewhere as ship systems are repaired outside.

02:14:58 Melinda Michaels strolls out.

02:14:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:15:00 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:15:02 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Lobby]

02:15:02 You see a small purple trash bin here.

02:15:13 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:15:14 Melinda Michaels just entered the ship.

02:15:22 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

02:15:24 You say, OOCly, "Sorry, having some technical problems."

02:15:26 You hear support drones within the space station's docking bay working diligently on the outside of the starship.

02:15:43 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Work harder little drones, work harder."

02:15:44 [Salvage Op] The salvage op is under attack!

02:15:53 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Go."

02:15:54 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All clear."

02:15:57 You begin the launch sequence.

02:16:02 A launch trajectory is located.

02:16:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:16:04 [Salvage Op] Shule Elemmire: "Coming back in."

02:16:12 The starship is already moving.

02:16:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:16:13 Via general sector communication, League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station transmits: "Yea op!"

02:16:16 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

02:29:47 You grin.

02:30:03 Melinda Michaels glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

02:30:04 Melinda Michaels presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

02:30:12 Melinda Michaels activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

02:30:35 You say, OOCly, "Can you fly for a sec? I'm having technical issues."

02:30:44 [Salvage Op] Melinda Michaels: "Looks like the beacon has been deployed."

02:31:05 [Salvage Op] Hakeem Oiadip: "Who?"

02:31:10 [Salvage Op] Evenia Callseah: "That is just..."

02:31:12 [Salvage Op] Melinda Michaels: "Idiots is who."

02:31:13 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "Mmhmm."

02:31:16 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No Ted, don't suggest flying in and straight back out again, don't do it."

02:31:24 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Haha."

02:31:25 [Salvage Op] Kim Saunders: "I'm ready to come in."

02:31:28 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "We'll use your cruiser."

02:31:31 [Salvage Op] Ted Warburton: "Clear."

02:31:33 [Salvage Op] Kim Saunders: "If the can is not too hot, that is."

02:31:33 [Salvage Op] Melinda Michaels: "It's clear."

02:31:35 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I don't have one."

02:31:41 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well, that would at least teach them not to be fuckin' idiots."

02:31:45 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Then your imaginary one."

02:31:47 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Exactly."

02:31:55 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That's already in there."

02:32:00 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heh ehat's going on?"

02:32:08 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Beacon."

02:32:14 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Some stupid idiots lanched a beacon."

02:32:15 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wow."

02:32:18 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "Oughtta go into their beacon with the cruiser."

02:32:23 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Idiots isn't the fucking word."

02:32:24 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Launched."

02:32:25 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Whose beacon."

02:32:32 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "We don't know yet."

02:32:32 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "No idea."

02:32:43 [Salvage Op] Ted Warburton: "Morris I was just saying I shouldn't suggest that."

02:32:51 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Complete fuckin' idiots. Who in their right mind even..."

02:32:54 There are no other ships in the sector.

02:32:54 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "You're horrible people, Ted."

02:32:59 [Salvage Op] Ted Warburton: "I know."

02:33:03 [Salvage Op] Shule Elemmire: "He's a people?"

02:33:04 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That is really not good and especially in this area."

02:33:12 [Salvage Op] Ted Warburton: "Apparently."

02:33:13 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "Maybe."

02:33:16 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent" has entered the sector.

02:33:18 Nicolette Lawrence's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The possibilities can be narrowed down quite a bit just baed on who and how many are involved in the op."

02:33:20 Starships In Sector:

02:33:20 
Salvage Regent..........................(14, 17, 5)

02:33:25 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Exactly."

02:33:30 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "Seriously though that would just make it worse. But it's an interesting thought anyhow."

02:33:35 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone have a ship name?"

02:33:40 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's about as smart as flying a capsule into outsider space, because you can."

02:33:44 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Room]

02:33:44 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a dark purple leather captain's chair here.
Melinda Michaels is standing here.
You can go south and out.

02:33:46 [Salvage Op] Ted Warburton: "We'd pull straight back out and leave them to it, now how horrible am I?"

02:33:52 [Salvage Op] Melinda Michaels: "We get outsiders on the op once in awhile but there is no need to drag a bunch of them in here. What if they see these unreg ships and get up with home."

02:34:02 [Salvage Op] Shule Elemmire: "Exactly."

02:34:04 [Salvage Op] Lily Kaise: "Exactly."

02:34:07 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Lobby]

02:34:21 [Salvage Op] Nissi Valdaire: "Or what if they call unregs, what are they gonna do then?"

02:34:25 [Salvage Op] Lily Kaise: "This just draws outsiders to this area moreso."

02:34:27 [Salvage Op] Melinda Michaels: "Yeah that too."

02:34:38 A small light next to the word MANUAL switches on, while a similar light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches off.

02:34:42 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent" has docked with a medium ultimate-grade salvage canister.

02:35:12 [Salvage Op] Evenia Callseah: "Sorry, but if they do, I won't be wiping their eyes when they're all upset about it. They made the mess."

02:35:24 [Salvage Op] Nissi Valdaire: "Mmhmm."

02:35:31 [Salvage Op] Shule Elemmire: "Precisely."

02:35:48 [Salvage Op] Ted Warburton: "What is it with people being insane lately."

02:35:57 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "Somethin in the water."

02:36:01 [Salvage Op] Shule Elemmire: "Good question."

02:36:02 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "Drink tea instead."

02:36:08 [Salvage Op] Evenia Callseah: "Thank fuck I don't drink water."

02:36:08 [Salvage Op] Ted Warburton: "Coffee rules."

02:36:25 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent" has undocked from a medium ultimate-grade salvage canister.

02:36:34 You smile at Melinda Michaels.

02:36:49 [Salvage Op] Kim Saunders: "Going down from 273, so I don't do the same sectors again."

02:36:50 [Salvage Op] Nissi Valdaire: "Okay dropping off my last. I'll go sit and try to see who's doing these beacons."

02:37:01 [Salvage Op] Melinda Michaels: "Okay."

02:37:08 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "It's Common But We Don't Talk About It" has entered the sector.

02:37:11 [Salvage Op] Evenia Callseah: "I'd really love to know who is that stupid."

02:37:18 [Salvage Op] Ted Warburton: "I reckon I can guess."

02:37:21 [Salvage Op] Kim Saunders: "I have about 80 thousand units to go."

02:37:22 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "All I know is who was talkin about it earlier."

02:37:25 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Somebody done gonna get a verbal ass kicking."

02:37:28 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "I need 20."

02:37:33 [Salvage Op] Evenia Callseah: "Yeah, there is that."

02:37:40 [Salvage Op] Morris Corlew: "If I could find some grade 80 that is."

02:37:41 You say, "Good."

02:37:44 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "It's Common But We Don't Talk About It" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

02:37:46 You say, "They deserve it."

02:37:47 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent" has left the sector.

02:37:52 [Salvage Op] Melinda Michaels: "Get that transport, hurry."

02:38:00 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "It's Common But We Don't Talk About It" has docked with a medium ultimate-grade salvage canister.

02:38:02 You say, "I just wish I was the one to give them a real ass kicking."

02:38:08 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Me too."

02:38:14 [Salvage Op] Evenia Callseah: "Morris, there's some over there, just over that way."

03:21:53 Kim stares uneasily and unhappily.

03:22:04 Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "Do you know where they could have been followed to?"

03:22:05 Joel Kringle asks in a southern California accent, "The Outsider could've followed the unregistered pirate?"

03:22:09 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Of course."

03:22:09 Shule glances around the room uneasily.

03:22:16 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "The outsider followed Johann's ship."

03:22:25 Joel Kringle asks in a southern California accent, "If they're all gone kaboomski how would that work?"

03:22:32 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I said one that routed."

03:22:35 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "They do that."

03:23:06 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

03:23:06 Melinda Michaels strolls down.

03:23:19 Melinda Michaels strolls in from below.

03:23:22 Melinda Michaels puts a secondary pilot command access unit in a black canvas gear bag.

03:23:24 Melinda Michaels sits down on a beige sofa.

03:23:26 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cool pint of Marzore Dark.

03:23:31 I don't understand that.

03:23:35 You are carrying a secondary pilot command access unit in your right hand.

03:23:40 Joel Kringle asks in a southern California accent, "So you mean a routed Outsider following a routed pirate?"

03:23:42 You put a secondary pilot command access unit in a leather briefcase.

03:23:47 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Sure."

03:23:53 Bryan Stout glances around at his surroundings.

03:23:59 Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "Why not?"

03:24:07 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "But."

03:24:08 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "I'm asking for clarity's sake."

03:24:35 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Anyway."

03:24:44 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yeah, you could have pulled unregs."

03:24:48 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cool pint of Marzore Dark.

03:24:50 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "There are always what ifs as far as anything goes."

03:25:04 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "There is a time to be risky and a time to not be stupid."

03:25:05 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "The unregistered pilots aren't dumb either."

03:25:14 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "They also don't have pods."

03:25:28 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Still on them. Everyone has a choice."

03:25:30 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yeah we have taken a few out in the ops but try hard to not do it."

03:25:38 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "We also pulled outsiders on ops. The unregs could have been followed just as easily could they not? I'm not trying to be snarky."

03:25:46 Nicolette Lawrence eats a few fluffy kernels from a small red and white bag of hot caramel popcorn.

03:25:52 Morris Corlew examines a small hot tea dispenser for a moment.

03:25:58 Morris Corlew helps himself to a cup of hot apricot tea.

03:26:07 Melinda says to Bryan, "They weren't there at the same time."

03:26:12 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Close but not."

03:26:25 Bryan Stout absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:26:31 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "There's always the possibility."

03:26:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:27:08 Melinda Michaels finishes off a cool pint of Marzore Dark.

03:27:08 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Jason Rat's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:27:09 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:27:11 Melinda Michaels puts a glass in a small natural golden brown trash bin.

03:27:50 Joel Kringle shrugs.

03:27:52 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, I was among the people who expressed some concern over that idea to put a BAS out here. Because of the situation with the unregs, and the Feng Wo collective relatively close by. We are not exactly in alliance space."

03:28:26 Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "I guess the Outsiders and the clans already know each other?"

03:28:26 Melinda Michaels glances at the coordinate rundown.

03:28:52 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I am not sure."

03:29:04 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "If they don't, I wouldn't want them to."

03:29:21 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "That is unclear. Ather believes the outsiders know about the Feng Wo collective, but whether that is true? How can we know?"

03:29:39 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "The spinward clans know of their distruction but we are not sure about Feng Wo."

03:29:47 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I mean, personal experiences."

03:29:56 Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Were these the first beacons done here?"

03:30:01 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "I'm assuming they were."

03:30:06 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Me too."

03:30:33 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "To the best of my knowledge, yes. But I haven't been out here much."

03:30:52 Johann Schraft walks down.

03:30:56 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Spinward Clans? They know the Outsiders. Feng Wo think they're safe here and I haven't seen any evidence they aren't, for now. But if they get found they're defenseless."

03:31:05 Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:31:09 Ted Warburton nods.

03:31:13 You nod to Nissi Valdaire.

03:31:16 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Star Of Gutenberg" has launched from League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station.

03:31:18 Joel Kringle asks in a southern California accent, "How close to Feng Wo are we?"

03:31:26 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Star Of Gutenberg" has launched from the docking bay.

03:31:31 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:31:35 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "200 light-years?"

03:31:40 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "No, less."

03:31:44 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "About that yeah."

03:31:45 Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "About 200 light years from Andy's signal?"

03:31:57 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Star Of Gutenberg" has disappeared from sensor scans.

03:32:01 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "But there are many unreg factions out here."

03:32:05 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "As we've seen."

03:32:06 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Feng Wo space extends north of that a bit. So...somewhere between 150 and 80."

03:32:09 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Andy's is in an almost straight line from here."

03:32:23 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "180 even."

03:32:23 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "About 120 from Andy's, if it's 200 out, and we are 80."

03:32:31 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Nah, 300 out."

03:32:31 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "It's 300 out."

03:32:39 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "Gotcha."

03:32:43 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "But Feng Wo space starts before Andy's."

03:32:45 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "But their hypercast goes 20."

03:32:48 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "I was over 100, that's all that matters."

03:32:55 Morris Corlew grins at Jason Rat.

03:34:13 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "If beacons shouldn't be done out here, perhaps put a message on the board if there isn't one? I didn't know that it wouldn't be good to do them out here. Not that I've done it, but no one knows unless told."

03:34:18 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Well cool beans."

03:34:24 Melinda says to Jason, "Come on."

03:34:31 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "You were here when we said why no BAS."

03:34:37 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "No, I wasn't."

03:34:43 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "You all want to be stupid, go for it."

03:34:49 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "I heard one wasn't going up, that's all."

03:34:50 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Otherwise use logic."

03:35:20 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "I haven't heard any real solid logic yet personally. Concerns yes and theories sure. Nothing super concrete one way or the other."

03:35:23 Kim frowns for a moment before she says: "I know beacons are fun to do, and I know some people are just fond of something extra dangerous to see how it goes. But instead of a board post while we were on an op, you could at least have checked with us on the risks. Melinda, Nissi and several others have been working hard to keep this going and as safe for everyone as possible.

03:35:35 Melinda says to Joel, "That doesn't surprise me."

03:35:46 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I was told it might not be a good idea. Not that I shouldn't do them at all. At least that's how it sounded."

03:35:49 Bryan Stout shrugs.

03:35:54 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "People get shit in their head and that's that."

03:35:56 Joel says to Melinda, "What? Because I don't run with thin hear say?"

03:36:06 Nissi Valdaire says in a Centaurian accent, "Don't invite extra trouble we don't need. The galaxy ain't our playground. There's some logic."

03:36:07 Nicolette Lawrence digs down into a small red and white bag of hot caramel popcorn, coming up with a half dozen fluffy kernels, which she eats all at once.

03:36:11 Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:36:13 Ted Warburton nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:36:48 Melinda says to Joel, "Letting the outsiders follow the unregs, possibly into mutuality space is not heresay. They were just two sectors separating the two groups. You go with your bad self."

03:37:01 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I begin to seriously wonder who else may have done a beacon around here and did not post it on the board."

03:37:29 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Because, on the first few days we did not outsiders on ops, and I can not recall having seen them on ops before, and then suddenly there they were."

03:37:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:37:39 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I've seen them on ops before."

03:37:40 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "I've seen them."

03:37:52 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "When I did a few cruiser ops out here years ago we got them."

03:37:56 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup we did."

03:38:15 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Ah, so they already knew we come this way a lot."

03:38:33 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Sure but there is no reason to purposefully call them in."

03:38:37 Morris clears his throat then quietly says, "When we set this capital up, as it was we got multiple factions. IFS and Outsiders. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that unregs and Outsiders could both show up. In effect, luring unregs into an Outsider trap."

03:38:39 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Or maybe call unregs in."

03:38:41 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "No, I'm not disputing that."

03:39:06 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I did voice that concern too when capital beacons were suggested."

03:39:09 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Jason Rat's shoulder.

03:39:13 Ted Warburton nods to Kim Saunders.

03:39:15 Lily Kaise nods to Kim Saunders.

03:39:24 Lily Kaise digs down into a small red and white bag of hot popcorn lightly tossed with dark chocolate, coming up with a half dozen fluffy kernels, which she eats all at once.

03:39:35 Vernos Bailey selects a single fluffy popped kernel from a small red and white bag of hot cheesy popcorn and eats it.

03:39:48 Vernos Bailey reaches repeatedly into a small red and white bag of hot cheesy popcorn, coming up with single kernels of popcorn and tossing them into his mouth one by one.

03:40:32 "You did but we did want to try finding out how these beacons worked." Melinda Michaels nods to Kim Saunders. "We may actually need them someday."

03:40:52 Kim Saunders nods.

03:41:05 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I'm sure we will use these again."

03:41:13 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Can't see why not."

03:41:39 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Evenia Callseah's shoulder.

03:41:48 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "One thing this week has shown though, and I'm not just talking about this incident, is that you can't rely on people to use logic."

03:41:55 Joel Kringle chuckles.

03:41:59 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Nice one."

03:42:01 Bryan Stout chuckles.

03:42:02 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot apricot tea.

03:42:07 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Well, Gonz."

03:42:15 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yeah the empty ship going through the rift."

03:42:17 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Heh that's pilots in general heh."

03:42:20 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:42:21 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Exactly."

03:42:39 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "That's people in general. Common sense is anything but."

03:42:41 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:42:57 Vernos Bailey says to Lily, "Not sure we should be talking the AEU knows all about stupid pilots."

03:42:57 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I think if we don't want things happening, we should make sure everybody knows, well, when it things you actually think you might need to say, anyway."

03:43:11 Melinda says to Ted, "It was said multiple times."

03:43:19 Lily Kaise glances at Vernos Bailey.

03:43:22 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "We are all adults here and shouldn't have to babysit."

03:43:23 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I heard it, but people often miss things."

03:43:34 Kim turns her attention to Bryan and Joel as she says: "We are not upset over this just for the fun of it. We are seriously worried, for the well being of all of humanity. This is not about credits, points, or a few pilots coming down on others. This could ultimately be about our survival. You know the outsiders would like nothing but to have us all extinct."

03:43:37 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "We baby sit like no one's business."

03:43:41 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Sometimes, people miss things because they choose not to hear them."

03:43:54 Melinda says to Kim, "Leave it go, they are going to be mouthy boys."

03:44:03 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Sometimes, yes, and sometimes they actually aren't there for the discussion."

03:44:05 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "I'm not even being mouthy."

03:44:07 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "That idiot knew better than to send an empty ship down here, he didn't need to be told and wouldn't have listened if he had been."

03:44:15 Bryan says to Joel, "Me either."

03:44:16 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Also with Andy's and Tom Town not far away outsiders could totally destroy them."

03:44:17 Nissi says to Joel, "It's natural to be defensive when you're being lectured so have your moment, it's fine. But we're not in our own backyard here. We're here to op, not fight. Be careful, don't take unnecessary risks, don't invite trouble. That goes for all of us."

03:44:23 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Yeah, I wouldn't have even thought of saying don't do that one."

03:44:30 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Exactly."

03:44:41 You nod to Nissi Valdaire.

03:44:43 Joel Kringle shrugs.

03:44:44 Ted Warburton nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:44:49 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Understood."

03:44:54 Bryan Stout absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:45:53 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot apricot tea.

03:46:42 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a mug of steaming hot chocolate.

03:46:47 Melinda says to Nicolette, "He doesn't htink he did anything wrong with that ship."

03:46:55 Nicolette says to Melinda, "Well he did."

03:46:57 Morris Corlew shakes his head.

03:47:10 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot apricot tea.

03:47:23 Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "What was it he sent out here?"

03:47:24 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I will make sure that is sorted, if it hasn't been already, I know things are in motion."

03:47:28 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Torp boat."

03:47:31 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Ah yeah."

03:47:39 Rogue Romano nods.

03:48:02 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "It might could be argued that the technology should've detected the fact that it was empty and just let it sit there, but it's still his fault."

03:48:36 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I do not want one of those ships in somebody else's hands if I can help it at all."

03:48:36 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Sending a ship, however many light-years through space unattended is just crazy."

03:48:43 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "To even attempt something like that..."

03:48:44 You say, "For real."

03:49:04 Melinda says to Nissi, "Can I just send the cruiser home?"

03:49:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:49:09 Nissi Valdaire grins.

03:49:22 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Let's just send all our show boats home and go in our capsules."

03:49:26 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Slow boats."

03:49:43 Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "We can use the Long-Range."

03:49:45 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:49:47 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Ha, I'd love to send my carrier and transport home in that slow-ass flow and take my capsule back, but it doesn't work that way."

03:49:48 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a mug of steaming hot chocolate.

03:49:50 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:49:50 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "In fairness, this was a corvette beacon which hopefully saw all the response of outsiders destroyed, let's hope it caused no lasting issues. It is not good, but if I compare it with some of the other things I have heard people consider they might want to try? Melinda put clear instructions about unregs on the board, yet some people never read it. Gonzales told me he would love to just do an op with a corvette or flying wing as defense and 1 salvager. I heard someone mention, whether for fun or whatever reason to launch a beacon in the middle of an op. Yeah, and hen the ship that flew here empty."

03:50:11 Lily Kaise blinks.

03:50:11 Kim Saunders frowns.

03:50:16 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Well then."

03:50:22 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Well."

03:50:23 You exclaim, "Dear goodness!"

03:50:26 Bryan Stout glances around at his surroundings.

03:50:35 Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "A ghost pilot?"

03:50:37 Morris Corlew whistles.

03:50:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:50:39 Melinda says to Rogue in a Bedford accent, "Put your boy on a leash."

03:50:41 Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:50:51 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:50:57 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "When I told Gonzales it was a seriously bad idea, he of course then said he'd try it in belt of Orion, but I am still convinced that is not what he originally meant."

03:50:58 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Haha, yeah, Rogue is welcome to do that to him."

03:51:10 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "A corvette op would be fun for defending, but that's something I'd do out of Orion."

03:51:24 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "I'd say somebody should talk to their Voice, but that joke wouldn't even be funny."

03:51:28 You nod to Jason Rat.

03:51:29 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "That can probably be done with a planet can or small org can locally in Orion."

03:51:32 Ted Warburton sighs.

03:51:33 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Destroyer would be doable here but very very dangerous."

03:51:39 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well we have more backup resources if things go wrong in comms range but not here."

03:51:39 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Evenia Callseah's shoulder.

03:51:45 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Failsafes would be smacked down."

03:51:45 You say to Jason, "We've done an op with a wing in Orion. It was fun."

03:51:53 Melinda waves to -zeus, "you tell 'em."

03:51:58 Joel Kringle snickers.

03:52:02 Jason Rat nods to you.

03:52:02 Evenia Callseah strokes a Tardick lizard named Zeus's warm scaly skin.

03:52:03 Bryan says to Jason, "We've done a stalwart op."

03:52:07 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a New Earth accent, "You go fly our ships hoe ok?"

03:52:10 Melinda says to Jason, "We've done Orion ops with my avenger."

03:52:11 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "So have I."

03:52:14 Evenia says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus in an Ars Magnan accent, "That's it, keep tellin' 'em."

03:52:19 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "Well yeah it was that."

03:52:20 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

03:52:23 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:52:26 Jason says to Melinda, "I was flying one of them."

03:52:29 Melinda Michaels nods.

03:52:37 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "But Orion and here are way different."

03:52:44 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Well."

03:52:52 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Avengers are sexy as fuck, let's face it."

03:52:54 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Don't forget orion was getting unregs for a while too."

03:52:58 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "I can't fly a morningstar here without getting my star morninged."

03:52:58 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I mean."

03:53:01 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well it's been a fun week. I have probably participated in more ops than I have in two years."

03:53:10 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Honestly. For one of those things. I point blank refused to go. That was the wing op. I straight up said it wasn't safe. And that I wouldn't go."

03:53:11 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Reminds me of something Jacob said. About how unregs should stay out of Orion and not go that close to our homes."

03:53:15 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Okay folks."

03:53:18 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "We got two squires once out here."

03:53:21 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a mug of steaming hot chocolate.

03:53:24 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "We did."

03:53:25 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:53:34 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Lets us get the last op done and lets go home."

03:53:39 Bryan Stout chuckles at Vernos Bailey.

03:53:40 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yep was engineering on one of those."

03:53:40 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

03:53:43 You say, "I remember."

03:53:44 Jason Rat asks in a North American accent, "Why did I get the first outsiders this week, and the first rapids, and not just 1, but 2?"

03:53:54 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Another thing, when people are outside this sector, they do not get notified of the board posts. Imagine some response had come to that beacon hat was harder than normal, and you would not have made it. You'd be on your way home in an escape pod and the next unsuspecting transport might have flown in there. I think that was another good reason for not putting a BAS here."

03:53:55 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Because they want your sandals."

03:53:57 You exclaim, "Yeah, that was kind of crazy!"

03:54:06 Lily Kaise nods.

03:54:09 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Jason Rat's shoulder.

03:54:14 Evenia says to Jason, "Coz they liked your dress? It's anyone's guess."

03:54:19 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:54:19 Kim says to Jason, "Awh."

03:54:20 Jason Rat nods to Joel Kringle. "I'm starting to think so."

03:55:35 Jason Rat asks in a North American accent, "What does Orion pay for ops again?"

03:55:35 Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "Anybody have keys to Erik's ships?"

03:55:44 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Not too much."

03:55:44 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I've barely seen him."

03:55:44 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I have a few."

03:55:45 Morris says to Melinda, "Nah."

03:55:52 Evenia Callseah shakes her head.

03:55:58 Melinda says to Bryan, "Tot he ships that are out here?"

03:55:59 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Nope."

03:56:03 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "30 to 40 mill for salvagers maybe?"

03:56:10 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Um, I don't think any of those, maybe his asteroid hauler if anything."

03:56:17 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Those are planet cans though."

03:56:21 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I can get that in two normal loads there."

03:56:41 Rogue Romano finishes off a mug of steaming hot chocolate.

03:56:41 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I hope nobody gets their shit stranded out here."

03:56:41 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Well, not far short, anyway."

03:56:44 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I dunno. I've only done one org op out there. Don't remember what it paid."

03:56:53 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:56:53 Rogue Romano puts a mug in a small natural golden brown trash bin.

03:56:54 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Ops are like anything else, if we kept at it down here the pay would eventually drop pretty sharply. I suspect that's what's happened with asteroids recently."

03:57:00 Bryan Stout nods to Nicolette Lawrence.

03:57:04 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I'll be happy to bring my carrier back if I need to."

03:57:04 Morris says to Melinda, "I'm concerned about Caleb."

03:57:05 "I hope they don't either." Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "But if we don't have keys, there isn't much we can do."

03:57:08 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, I sure hope everyone will get out of here all right."

03:57:16 You nod.

03:57:19 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I always go around and check the beacon and other stations and plan accordingly."

03:57:29 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So glad you posted that before I did."

03:57:37 Morris says to Melinda, "Only seen him a couple times, but I do have a key to his haulerr that's out there."

03:57:49 Nicolette Lawrence asks in a California accent, "Send it home Empty?"

03:57:51 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Or maybe not."

03:57:53 Morris Corlew smirks.

03:57:55 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Probably not."

03:57:55 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "No."

03:57:57 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Nah, not him."

03:57:57 Ali Candan strides in from below.

03:57:59 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "He's probably resting in it."

03:58:02 Lily Kaise waves to Ali Candan.

03:58:03 You wave to Ali Candan.

03:58:03 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:58:04 Ted Warburton waves.

03:58:06 You say to Ali Candan, "Yo."

03:58:07 Morris says to Melinda, "Likely."

03:58:08 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "He seems to require a lot of rest."

03:58:15 Lily Kaise gets a handful of popcorn from a small red and white bag of hot popcorn lightly tossed with dark chocolate and eats it.

03:58:20 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Not quite sure why he even came down here, given all the rest he seems to require."

03:58:28 Ali Candan waves.

03:58:30 Lily Kaise eats several small but fluffy popped kernels from a small red and white bag of hot popcorn lightly tossed with dark chocolate.

03:58:33 Kim Saunders waves to Ali Candan.

03:58:33 Evenia Callseah exclaims in an Ars Magnan accent, "Ali!"

03:58:34 Morris says to Ali in an Appalachian accent, "Yo."

03:58:39 Lily Kaise tips a small red and white bag of hot popcorn lightly tossed with dark chocolate, shakes the last of its contents into her mouth, then crumples up the empty container and tosses it into a nearby trash bin.

03:58:39 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Star Of Gutenberg" has suddenly appeared on sensor scans.

03:58:41 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Kins."

03:58:45 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot apricot tea.

03:58:54 Bryan Stout nods and nods.

03:58:57 Morris Corlew laughs at Ted Warburton.

03:59:13 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

03:59:18 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Star Of Gutenberg" has docked with League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station.

03:59:21 Evenia Callseah gets a handful of popcorn from a small red and white bag of hot cheesy popcorn and eats it several kernels at a time.

03:59:24 Ali Candan glances at the coordinate rundown.

03:59:28 Evenia Callseah eats a few fluffy kernels from a small red and white bag of hot cheesy popcorn.

03:59:55 Evenia says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus in an Ars Magnan accent, "Don't try it. You aren't having popcorn."

04:00:04 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

04:00:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:00:17 Vernos Bailey asks in a neutral accent, "So last op?"

04:00:26 Evenia Callseah laughs at Vernos Bailey. "You are so damn eager."

04:00:32 You grin.

04:00:32 Kim Saunders grins.

04:00:34 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Just want to get done."

04:00:35 Evenia Callseah digs down into a small red and white bag of hot cheesy popcorn, coming up with a half dozen fluffy kernels, which she eats all at once.

04:00:41 Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "It's refreshing actually."

04:00:45 Lily Kaise glances at her metallic gold touch einrophone and checks her voicemail.

04:00:53 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:00:55 Evenia Callseah gets a handful of popcorn from a small red and white bag of hot cheesy popcorn and eats it.

04:01:04 Evenia Callseah eats several small but fluffy popped kernels from a small red and white bag of hot cheesy popcorn.

04:01:21 Vernos says to Lily, "It is nothing personal lily, the AEU just has a bad history of pilots not using our brains."

04:01:25 You glance at your metallic gold touch einrophone and check your voicemail.

04:01:25 You have two new messages and one saved message. Dial 7 to listen to them.

04:01:35 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Star Of Gutenberg" has launched from League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station.

04:01:49 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Not sure how much longer I am awake though tonight. I am definitely not flying home tonight."

04:02:01 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Me either."

04:02:02 Vernos Bailey glances at a power readout.

04:02:12 You hear a solid thud as a ship sets down in the docking bay.

04:02:15 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "Nor me, I'll take my ships tomorrow unless I see messages to take anything else."

04:02:39 Joel Kringle stands up from a beige sofa.

04:02:40 Joel Kringle wanders down.

04:03:00 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:03:22 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Probably get my carrier home first, then bring the capsule out to check and see if Caleb's still parked her before things go down unless I can raise somebody on the hypercaster."

04:04:26 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, I am also a bit worried about Eli."

04:04:39 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Yeah I don't know anyone with a key though."

04:04:39 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Evenia Callseah's shoulder.

04:04:45 Nicolette Lawrence says in a California accent, "Eli's been a pilot longer than you and me put together, I imagine he can take care of himself."

04:04:52 Joel Kringle wanders in from below.

04:05:03 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "We should do the last op in the morningstar."

04:05:04 Jason Rat nods.

04:05:08 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "The only option I can think of is be here when the station goes offline."

04:05:12 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "No thank you."

04:05:14 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Then you'd have to break in."

04:05:17 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

04:05:17 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I'm up for an op."

04:05:29 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I have not been on one yet today."

04:05:29 Kim says to Nicolette, "Well, I would like to hope so. But I can still be worried for a fellow pilot who has not been around much for over 2 years."

04:05:36 Nicolette Lawrence nods to Kim Saunders.

04:05:36 Lily Kaise nods.

04:05:40 You nod.

04:06:15 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well he has 3 days available and hopefully he will come to work and realize the limitations he has."

04:06:19 Lily Kaise grins.

04:06:27 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "Limitations?"

04:06:28 Bryan Stout glances around at his surroundings.

04:06:35 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Time left on the stations."

04:06:35 Kim Saunders glances at a power readout.

04:06:39 A Tardick lizard named Thor curls its tail loosely around Jason Rat's neck.

04:07:03 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Hard to imagine we have been here almost a week. No, not almost, already."

04:07:28 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Okay lets get this op done."

04:07:33 Joel Kringle takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

04:07:34 Jason says to Melinda, "Hey."

04:08:02 Jason says to Melinda, "I'll help you bring stuff back. I'll fly my carrier back, drop your hauler, and I can bring Blazer back out if needed."

04:08:10 Jason Rat asks in a North American accent, "I think that's the ship name?"

04:09:24 Rogue Romano yawns.

04:09:42 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "I can do the op, I just don't want to fly."

04:09:52 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I suppose I could fly."

04:10:01 Jason Rat nods.

04:10:07 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "I can gun."

04:10:11 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I do not want to salvage any more though if I can possibly help it."

04:10:22 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Or engineer if I got tools to borrow."

04:10:30 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "I can do whatever."

04:10:31 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "I would like to gun."

04:10:38 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "Me too."

04:10:42 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I could do defense, but I am afraid if I have to salvage more I may fall asleep."

04:10:48 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'd gun this next one."

04:10:51 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "I don't mind salvaging this time."

04:10:52 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "I'll salvage then."

04:11:51 Bryan Stout asks in a Canadian accent, "How many we got for defense?"

04:12:17 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Me."

04:12:17 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "I'm going to repair."

04:12:22 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "Yay repair."

04:12:25 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Lily, Kim, Jason, Rogue, myself, and uh..."

04:12:36 Lily raises her hand.

04:12:36 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Vernos."

04:12:38 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I can defend too."

04:12:42 Bryan Stout gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

04:13:00 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "I think we have enough for the cruiser."

04:13:01 Rogue Romano stands up from a beige sofa.

04:13:02 Ted Warburton asks in a Candelarian accent, "One more salvager?"

04:13:07 Morris Corlew asks in an Appalachian accent, "So Lily, Kim, Jason, Rogue, Vern, and myself on defense, Joel, Bryan, and Ted salvage?"

04:13:09 Kim Saunders stands up from a beige sofa.

04:13:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:13:14 Ted Warburton says in a Candelarian accent, "That works."

04:13:21 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "I can salvage."

04:13:27 Rogue Romano says in a Ticulian accent, "Bryan said he wanted defense."

04:13:37 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Ali just said he'd salvage so there we go."

04:13:40 Lily Kaise stands up from a beige sofa.

04:13:47 Joel Kringle takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

04:14:16 Bryan Stout gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

04:14:31 Joel Kringle asks in a southern California accent, "You guys are using the Morning Star though right?"

04:14:34 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "No."

04:14:41 Melinda says to you in a Bedford accent, "Are you going?"

04:14:41 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "We got 7, so we can use the cruiser."

04:14:47 Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "Cool."

04:14:57 Vernos Bailey asks in a neutral accent, "Pincer and vette?"

04:14:58 You say, "If there's room."

04:15:04 Bryan says to you in a Canadian accent, "There's one spot."

04:15:05 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "You got 8."

04:15:06 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "I don't have a key to the cruiser."

04:15:09 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:15:11 You stand up from a beige sofa.

04:15:13 Bryan Stout stands up from a beige sofa.

04:15:14 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:15:20 Jason Rat stands up from a beige sofa.

04:15:39 Morris Corlew finishes off a cup of hot apricot tea.

04:15:41 Morris Corlew puts a cup in a small natural golden brown trash bin.

04:15:42 Morris Corlew stands up from a beige sofa.

04:15:42 Melinda Michaels slides a "Just Dropping In" key off of a huggy pug keychain.

04:15:53 Melinda Michaels slides a "Just Dropping In" key onto a huggy pug keychain.

04:15:56 Joel Kringle wanders down.

04:15:58 Melinda Michaels slides an "I Love You, I'll Kill You" key off of a huggy pug keychain.

04:16:03 Melinda says to Morris, "I'll need that back."

04:16:08 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels. "Course."

04:16:08 Melinda Michaels gives an "I Love You, I'll Kill You" key to Morris Corlew.

04:16:12 Morris Corlew slides an "I Love You, I'll Kill You" key onto a simulated motion exploding supernova keychain.

Morris Corlew, Rogue Romano, and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:17:36 You nod.

04:17:36 You follow Morris Corlew into the ship.

04:17:36 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Room]

I don't understand that.

04:17:41 Please do not enter so many commands at once.

04:17:41 Kim Saunders strides in from the north.

04:17:42 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Lobby]

04:17:42 The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.

04:18:00 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Weapons Room Three]

04:18:01 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a swiveling dark purple leather gunner's chair here.
You can go east.

04:18:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:18:38 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:19:03 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:19:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

04:21:45 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Weapons Room Three]

04:21:45 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

05:31:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:31:45 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Corridor Alpha]

05:31:45 You can go east, south, west, and up.

05:31:46 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Weapons Room Four]

05:31:47 Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go west.

05:31:49 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:32:07 The starship transitions into another sector.

05:32:11 Starships In Sector:

05:32:11 
Let Me Rock Your World..................(11, 11, 10)

05:32:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:32:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:32:40 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:32:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:32:47 You hear a sudden high-pitched whine all over the ship as the engineer effects swift repair of all components.

05:32:54 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There, it was the last use."

05:32:59 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Wow that payout was the lowest I've received so far but hey it's more cash."

05:33:00 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:33:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

05:33:08 You ask, "How much?"

05:33:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:33:40 You hear support drones within the space station's docking bay working diligently on the outside of the starship.

05:33:40 You peer out...

[League Rift Accelerating Repairing Nuclear Autonav Station; Docking Bay]
A small, basic docking bay is the core of the station, along with the life support system and resource storage. Small hatches lead to the other station modules.
The eight-person prime defense mark two "I Love You, I'll Kill You" is parked here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

05:34:03 You hear support drones within the space station's docking bay working diligently on the outside of the starship.

05:34:07 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Vern."

05:34:24 You hear support drones within the space station's docking bay working diligently on the outside of the starship.

05:34:44 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Clear."

05:34:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

05:35:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

05:35:05 Lily Kaise glides west.

[Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Weapons Room Five]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You can go east.

05:35:16 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Corridor Beta]

05:35:16 You can go north, east, south, and west.

05:35:17 You can go east, south, west, and up.

05:35:17 You can't go that way.

05:35:17 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Lobby]

05:35:18 You see a small purple trash bin here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, northwest, and down.

05:35:18 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Room]

05:35:18 You see a decoy beacon launcher and a dark purple leather captain's chair here.
Morris Corlew and Jason Rat are standing here.
You can go south and out.

05:35:30 Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Gotta let Rat grab the hauler."

05:35:46 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

05:35:49 Morris sighs heavily.

05:35:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:35:49 Morris Corlew begins the docking sequence.

05:35:49 You nod.

05:35:50 Morris Corlew sits down on a dark purple leather captain's chair.

05:35:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

05:35:54 Lily Kaise waves.

05:35:56 You can't do that here.

05:35:58 Jason Rat jogs out.

05:35:59 Morris says to Lily, "Stay put."

05:35:59 You peer out...

05:35:59 
[League Deep Space Operations Nuclear Temporary Station; Docking Bay]
A small, basic docking bay is the core of the station, along with the life support system and resource storage. Small hatches lead to the other station modules.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Let Me Rock Your World" and the eight-person prime defense mark two "I Love You, I'll Kill You" are parked here.
You can go north, east, south, up, and down.

05:36:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:36:04 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

05:36:06 Lily Kaise yawns.

05:36:07 Morris Corlew begins the launch sequence.

05:36:12 A launch trajectory is located.

05:36:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

05:36:16 The computer reports that the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Let Me Rock Your World" has launched from League Deep Space Operations Nuclear Temporary Station; Docking Bay.

05:36:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

05:36:22 Morris Corlew presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

05:36:23 Morris Corlew ducks under the arm of Shule Elemmire as he checks a nearby control panel.
(12 seconds roundtime.)

05:36:23 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station.

05:36:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:36:32 The computer reports that the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Let Me Rock Your World" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

05:36:34 Via general sector communication, Let Me Rock Your World transmits a text-based transmission: "No, don't kill me!"

05:36:34 [Starship "I Love You, I'll Kill You"; Control Room]

05:36:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a dark purple leather captain's chair here.
Morris Corlew is sitting on a dark purple leather captain's chair. Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

05:37:14 Vernos Bailey is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

05:37:15 Lily Kaise glides in.

05:37:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:37:16 Lily Kaise exits the ship.

05:37:16 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

05:37:17 Vernos Bailey exits the ship.

05:37:30 Bryan Stout ambles in from below.

05:37:30 Morris Corlew lopes down.

05:37:33 Vernos Bailey says in a neutral accent, "Well folks, that is it."

05:37:38 Bryan Stout says in a Canadian accent, "That it is."

05:37:43 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yup and good night all."

05:37:46 Ali Candan says in a Turkish accent, "See you all on the other side. Thanks for all the fun."

05:37:47 You say, "Yep."

05:37:47 Jason Rat reaches repeatedly into a small red and white bag of hot popcorn lightly tossed with dark chocolate, coming up with single kernels of popcorn and tossing them into his mouth one by one.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Station Message Board/League Rift Accelerating Repairing Nuclear Autonav Station in Op Station Rho 273/General.

05:41:50 Nissi Valdaire walks down.
Morris says to Nicolette in an Appalachian accent, "Course not."
"You okay?" Bryan Stout looks at Morris Corlew thoughtfully.

05:41:57 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "So, if anybody needs anything, send a hypercast."

05:42:00 Rogue says to Bryan, "When you want to dock it?"

05:42:01 Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I am out."

05:42:05 Jason Rat says in a North American accent, "Same."

05:42:06 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

05:42:06 Lily Kaise waves to Melinda Michaels.

05:57:00 "You see a cleaning crew?" Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

05:57:03 Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Seeing how... sensitive Vernos is to this, I did not need to specify."

05:57:10 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Just spray some air freshener in there."

05:57:14 Morris Corlew sighs.

06:17:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

06:17:22 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anyway, I guess I should be thinking about sleep."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.

06:24:19 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]

06:24:19 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else.

06:44:56 You say, "I think they were annoyed that I wouldn't salvage."

06:45:04 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I just should have said hey dude, I've probably salvaged more than you will ever salvage in your lifetime and left it at that."

06:45:56 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm sure."

06:46:11 You say, "Honestly, I know people want to do certain things. Usually, it's because they have strangths in those areas or have their own goals."

06:47:29 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Right and they should be respected. Melinda also loves to blow things way out of proportion. I engineered on 3 maybe 4 at the most out of the ten ops I participated in and only a couple did I express that I wanted to engineer beyond the 3 or 4 that I did."

06:47:38 You nod.

06:48:09 You say, "And you know what? Rogue had already said she preferred to gun and she was put in the engineering role."

06:48:34 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh I did."

06:48:35 You say, "That's just stupid."

06:48:59 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "They were determined to make it difficult for me and to try to get a reaction out of me."

06:49:22 You say, "Not everyone is good at everything. Not everyone can fly or is comfortable flying. It goes for everything else."

06:49:38 You nod to Lily Kaise.

06:50:17 Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Right and not everyone has the same energy level or physical coordination at all hours of the day. Early morning is not a good time for me for sure in terms of my peak energy."

06:50:24 You nod.

06:50:27 You say, "Exactly."

06:51:25 You say, "And on a morningstar where people need to be comfortable fighting in a fighter... Just wow."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

14:02:27 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.

16:38:09 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]

16:38:09 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.

20:16:58 Kim Saunders says, "Except, we have no trash can here."

20:17:04 You say to Kim, "Safe traels. Oh."

20:17:09 Kim Saunders takes another large bite of a turkey sandwich.

20:17:10 You say, "Erm, save travels."

20:17:11 Kim Saunders finishes off the last of a turkey sandwich.

20:17:17 Kim Saunders nods. "Thanks."

20:39:07 [League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Control Room]

20:39:07 This is the rather cramped hub of the space station. A starmap, coordinate rundown display, and a few basic station controls are present. There's also a sofa!
You see a beige sofa and a metal table here.
You can go down.

20:39:37 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 902087644 at North: "Or anybody who is at 273. Rat is going to get my ships that are out there. I think. This is Mel."

22:17:15 You wave to Damien Goss.

22:17:18 Damien Goss waves.

22:17:21 Damien Goss asks, "Seen anyone else?"

22:17:35 You say, "Well, Kim left a while ago... And I saw Eli."

22:17:36 Damien Goss navigates his white swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

22:19:16 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Station Message Board/League Rift Accelerating Repairing Nuclear Autonav Station in Op Station Rho 273/Announcements.

22:19:31 Damien Goss asks, "Did eli leave already?"

22:19:37 You say, "Yeah, he did."

22:20:22 [Starship "Happy"; Airlock]

22:20:22 You see an early warning space defense device and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:20:23 I don't understand that.

22:20:24 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]

22:20:24 You see a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, Meow the little calico CatBot, a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a small purple trash bin here.

22:20:27 I can't find "soofa."

22:20:29 You sit down on an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it.

22:20:30 You blink heavily and then doze off.

22:38:52 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.

22:39:18 You kiss Lily Kaise.

22:39:34 Shule Elemmire

22:39:34 He appears to be 27 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has olive skin. His body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. He has average-sized shoulders and a wide chest. His face is average-shaped and handsome, with a broad nose and strong chin. His lips are thin and tan and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and round. His shoulder-length, straight hair is blonde and neatly trimmed over the ears and parted on the side. He has large brownish fingernails.
 He is wearing a red shipsuit with white trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. He is also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. His head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

22:55:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

23:37:31 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.

23:47:26 Lily Kaise says, "Going to go feed the lizie."

23:47:28 Lily Kaise glides out.

23:57:12 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

23:57:17 Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it.

23:57:20 Lily Kaise carefully unwraps a kebab sandwich.

23:57:24 Lily Kaise picks up half of a kebab sandwich and takes a huge bite.

23:58:07 Lily Kaise takes another large bite of a kebab sandwich.

23:58:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

23:58:15 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cool glass of bubbly golden tea.
