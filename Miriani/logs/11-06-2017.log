00:05 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Awww, thanks. I appreciate that. I didn't know when I'd be around either."

00:05 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:05 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

00:05 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

00:05 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:05 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
The ship is already in space.

00:05 You're already sitting down.

00:05 You're already buckled in.

00:05 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:06 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:06 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:06 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:06 Enter a destination:

00:06 [Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

00:06 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:06 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:06 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

00:06 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:06 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:06 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:06 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

00:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

00:07 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:07 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

00:07 You must stand up first.

00:07 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

00:07 You stand up.

Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

01:18 ["Al Nar" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an overstuffed gold engineer's chair, a violet armchair, and an internal stun turret here.

02:20 You peer southwest and see...

02:20 ["Al Nar" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an overstuffed gold engineer's chair, a violet armchair, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

02:20 ["Al Nar" Weapons Room 2] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an overstuffed gold gunner's chair, a violet armchair, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go southwest.

02:21 That object was not found.

02:21 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:21 There are no ships here.

02:21 There are no ships here.

02:21 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:21 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:21 Dora West's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "45, 69, 86"

02:21 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:21 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:21 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:21 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:21 Dora West's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "pew pew or die"

02:21 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:21 Jessica Marin's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ok ready justin ?"

02:21 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:21 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:21 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

04:08 Starship Communication Relay
--------------------------------------------------
A starship communication relay is a transmitter that allows your ship to relay transmissions to authorized users up to 10 lightyears away. Essentially it's a private communication channel centered around a starship crew rather than a private organization or an alliance. The relay itself must be constructed with the asteroid mining construction facility. Once you have the upgrade installed, the following commands apply:

CHANNEL - When used in the control room, allows you to enable/disable the relay, authorize communicators, and deauthorize communicators. 
TR SHIP <message> - Transmits to the ship's private channel.

NOTE: The relay will only function within 10 lightyears of the ship.

Starship Retrofit Construction Facility
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
A starship retrofit construction facility allows you to construct a starship retrofit facility on an asteroid's surface.

  Requirements
 * An asteroid rover to deploy the facility.
 * One or more droids.

  Commands
USE: Allows you to assign a destination for the finished product as well as assigning and relieving droids.
STATUS <facility>: Displays a report of the facilities current progress.
REQUIREMENTS <facility>: Displays a list of the required materials to build a single chunk. Can be shortened to REQ.
CARGO <facility>: Displays a list of what the facility currently contains.

  Special Droid Commands
DELIVER: Instructs a droid to make another delivery attempt if it's carrying a chunk. This command is typically never used, but is useful if something goes wrong with the first delivery attempt. If a chunk delivery fails for too long, the entire project will be automatically scrapped.

  Procedure
Once the facility is deployed, you'll want to select a site to begin building the actual retrofit facility. This site can be located at any set of valid coordinates on the asteroid, provided those coordinates aren't occupied by any other piece of mining equipment. It's wise, however, to choose a location close to the retrofit construction facility to minimize transit time. To set a site, type USE FACILITY and select option 1 to change the destination.

The next thing you'll want to do is assign one or more droids to the facility. When the facility completes building a chunk, it will require a droid to deliver that chunk to the destination site and begin integrating it into the final product. The facility is capable of storing only so many completed chunks before it's full. You can see how many chunks have been queued for delivery by viewing the STATUS. It's important to note that all other droid functions will be superceded by the delivery task. To assign a droid, type USE FACILITY and choose option 2, assign droid. To restore a droid to normal function, choose option 3, relieve droid.

Once you have everything assigned, you'll want to begin transferring the raw materials to the facility. This is accomplished by ATTACHing a length of tubing to both the facility and an asteroid rover. Type TRANSFER in the rover's control room to begin the material transfer.

Once the requirements are met, the facility will begin constructing "chunks". Chunks are small building blocks that are used in the construction of a larger, more complex project. You can view the STATUS of the facility to see how many chunks have been completed and if the facility is currently working or not.

  Miscellaneous Notes
 * The facility will draw enough power to complete a chunk when it begins working. This means that if your reactor suddenly stops su
04:09 pplying power, the facility will still be able to complete the chunk that it's working on. However, be aware that a reactor explosion could still potentially damage or destroy the facility. Always keep your reactor maintained.
 * This facility can be loaded into a rover. The retrofit facility that it constructs, however, is a permanent structure.

The handheld electronics manufacturing facility allows you to create handheld objects from raw materials mined on asteroids. These facilities can be expanded via materials chips, each of which contains information on a final product as well as the requirements for building it.

  Commands
INSTALL [chip] INTO [facility] - Loads a materials chip into the facility.
UNINSTALL [facility] - Remove a materials chip from the facility. The queue must be empty and the facility inactive before a chip can be removed.
USE [facility] - Access a menu of commands for the facility.
UNLOAD [facility] - Retrieve the objects that have been created by the facility. You can either remove them one at a time or all at once in a convenient carrying bin.

  Selling Objects
Objects created in the electronics manufacturing facility can be sold in private upgrade stores, much the same way as starship upgrades. To load a container full of objects into the store, you simply DUMP it while in the store and the machinery will do the sorting from there.

05:02 Starship Retrofit Facility
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
A starship retrofit facility is a permanent structure that allows upgrades to be installed on a starship from the asteroid's surface. This file assumes you've already constructed a retrofit facility. If that's not the case, please see HELP STARSHIP RETROFIT CONSTRUCTION FACILITY.

  Commands
USE: Allows you to begin/abort a retrofit, view available, upgrades, and enable/disable the landing beacon.
STATUS <RETROFIT>: Displays status information, including what ship is being upgraded, what upgrade is being installed, when the installation began, and a rough estimate of how long it will take to complete the upgrade under ideal circumstances.

  Procedure
USE the RETROFIT facility and choose the option to retrofit a starship. The ship you want to retrofit must be landed at the same coordinates as the facility.


  Miscellaneous Notes
 * The starship being upgraded will be put into "maintenance mode", meaning most ship functions will be offline for the duration of the upgrade.
 * If the upgrade should fail or be aborted, the upgrade will be lost.

This large circular landing pad is marked off by a low wooden fence. Tied to it are what look to be at least a hundred balloons bobbing in the wind, all in a profusion of bright colors.

Two wide paved roads lead off from the landing site, curving away out of sight between large shady trees.

16:25 [51 Pegasi b; Knick Knacks and Novelties] (indoors)
A bright pattern of pink and orange zigzags makes up the decor in this small crowded shop. A wide assortment of various novelty items fills every available surface on the lime green shelves and lavender tables scattered throughout the shop. The entire left wall is devoted to keychains, and across the store is a section of mechanical pets. Upbeat techno dance music is playing at a considerable volume, making conversation nearly impossible.
You see a large blue trash can and a purple and blue keychain transfer station here.
You can go west.

16:25 I don't understand that.

16:25 You do not appear to be holding 2 keychains.

16:25 You're not wearing that.

16:25 I don't understand that.

16:25 You unclip a standard keyring from a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it.

16:26 Which way would you like to transfer keys?

16:26 1: From a standard keyring to a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain.
2: From a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain to a standard keyring.
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:26 You quickly insert a standard keyring and a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain into a purple and blue keychain transfer station.

16:26 A purple and blue keychain transfer station begins making several clinking sounds.
Two robotic arms grasp each keychain firmly while a third removes all the keys from a standard keyring and quickly slides them onto a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain.
A purple and blue keychain transfer station spits a standard keyring and a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain back into your hands.

16:26 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of faded blue jeans with metal studs around the back pockets over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black stun armor storage bag, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a red archaeological artifact storage container, a black rolled toolkit, a level five archaeological dig site scanner, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

16:26 You are carrying a standard keyring in your left hand and a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain in your right hand.

16:26 A standard keyring

16:26 A circular metal keyring that one can WEAR on their person or CLIP to a belt.
You see nothing on it.

16:26 You don't see that here.

16:26 You don't have "keyr ing".

16:26 You put a standard keyring in a large blue trash can.

16:26 You clip a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain to a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it.

You can go south and out.

16:27 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

16:27 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

16:28 Jenaia the droid

16:28 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a red keychain with "beer lover for life" printed on it.
She is carrying nothing.

This large circular landing pad is marked off by a low wooden fence. Tied to it are what look to be at least a hundred balloons bobbing in the wind, all in a profusion of bright colors. Fanciful balloon patterns have been chalked onto the cement surface of the landing pad itself. Two wide paved roads lead off from the landing site, curving away out of sight between large shady trees.

16:59 A shiny silver medical drone

16:59 The exterior of this drone is spherical and mostly smooth. The contiguous outer shell is marred only by a number of small fins and grills, apparently intended to help the drone stay afloat or to cool the inner workings. Four smaller holes are placed at even intervals around the drone's body, presumably used for firing stun or counterstun shots. There is no evident sensory system, though a panel at the top of the drone seems to be used for the loading or unloading of ammunition.

17:01 I don't understand that.

17:01 You say, "jenaia"

17:01 Jenaia the droid

17:01 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is hunched over, seemingly without power.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a shiny gold metal star keychain.
She is carrying nothing.

17:02 Jenaia the droid suddenly powers back up.

17:02 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

17:02 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

17:02 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

17:26 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site.

22:50 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

22:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:50 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

22:50 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:50 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:50 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

22:50 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:50 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:50 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:50 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:51 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

22:51 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:51 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:51 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:51 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:51 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:51 You must stand up first.

22:51 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

22:51 You stand up.
