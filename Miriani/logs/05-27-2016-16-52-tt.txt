Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Joy Ride"; Living Quarters Two]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a set of lavender
silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower

Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not yet."

[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "How do I use a medical center? I
have tried repare and heal and such."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lie creche."
An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.
The hovertruck smoothly negotiates a turn, tilting slightly so you are not
thrown off the trailer.
The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

Lily Kaise smiles at you.
Lily Kaise glides out.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Where do I find rats? I've tried the
dusty reaches and spinward which were the two places I was told to go, but I'm
not seeing them in either place."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Go to debris rich sectors."
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "Don't forget about checking other
sectors besides those two. Like Joel said debris sectors will have them."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "They appear at random in sectors with
debris. You can go out of the beaconed sectors and find them sometimes too."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "The only debris sectors I know are
those two as well."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Is there a way to find debris
sectors on the sector list?"
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "For example sectors such as a-19, a-23,
a-36, a few sectors belonging to your alliance."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "If I am artifacting, and have to
unexpectedly leave, is there anything I can do to make sure my ship doesn't
explode?"
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Is there a way to know whcih sector
is what on the jump list?"
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "Besides jumping back to a place where
you can land...no?"
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "What do you mean Janice?"
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "For the league, things in the cluster of
sector 11 also have debris I think."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "If you to the torus, then go around
the secters there, you'll probably find nests and rats."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "You tend to remember. The best advice is
to check your rundown or starmap and see how much debris is in there."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "If you go to dusty reaches, spinward
cluster, sector 11 or similar sectors, and type jump and look at the list, you
can see where else you can jump within that same cluster."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Well still no luck on rats, I've
tried some of the sectors like sector 11 and such and though i've seen some
debris no rats. A shame my crgo hauler is gone I could collect more debris."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Try the Belt of Orion, perhaps?"
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "... wait. You could buy another
hauler...unless you're using a fighter you should be able to collect debirs."
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "Debris."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I can collect debris, but I didn't
have the money for a hauler."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I just about had enough for a
flitter. I tried a suit mission but my suit got blown up so now I'm even more in
debt."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I'm actually pretty broke."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Also keep checking the sectors every so
often, just because there were no rats there just now, does not mean they may
not be there in half an hour or so."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "You could ask for help over things
like general for money. Or lones can help."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "And you can salvage with a flitter, not
with a fighter though."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "That's what I'm doing now."
A white bird flashes by over the plain.
A white bird flashes by over the plain.
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "How do I aim up? I thought it was
+5."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Or just +."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "For straight up just +, the 5 comes into
play for moving only."
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "Wait. I don't have to do +s?"
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "You can hit just the + and it will aim
up. The five will fly you straight up or straight down when you're flying your
ship on manual navigation."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "When I put plus I just keep getting
told "choose a direct on the new z access""
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "You do need to type aim +, not just the
+. Just in case you didn't know that."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Or replace aim with the slash sign."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Well that was really crap."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I wish you could get a quicker
readout of where the enemy is rather than all that guff about "the computer says
you have detected bla bla bla bla" is there a way to just speed it up? It'd be
nice to get an instant report."
A white bird flashes by over the plain.
A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.
A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
The endless pathways of webbing twist around a bend.
With a sound like scraping stone, the ship changes direction.
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
The starship lurches as it falls through one part of the webbing into another.

[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Is there any reason that aim _ would
not work for someone?"
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Sorry, aim +."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Do you need the period?"
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I really am getting a little tired
of combat not working out here."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Which client are you using?"
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Though admitedly there were about 8
rats in that sector."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Vipmud, though again if I have to
rescript the hole bloody client to play a game it's not accessible, I just want
to play I don't want to build clients."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "And my ship's destroyed so that's
things completely buggered. Ah, it hurts!"
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "What were you having issues with
specifically. Not sure if I missed anything."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Combat just doesn't work right, I
can't actually ttrack the enemy sinse it's super spammy, I have had two ships
destroyed, and when I try to aim up it doesn't work at all."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "See if you can join in on any activities
with other players, like a beacon or a nest, you should earn enough credits to
get you back on your feet that way."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "AHH!"
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Aim + should really work to aim up, I
just tried to do it."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Well aim + is what I've been doing
and I'm just told "specify a direction on the new z axis or siomething like
that""
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Also, jumping out of the sector is
possible if you are dealing with rats. If things get too rough, you do not need
to stay."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I tried to jump out of the sector
but my ship had already gone boom. The pain!"
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Oh it comes in two steps."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "You type five or S if you have alt man
nav on."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "After the prompt.. I use the alt nav
stuff so I just type /r and there it goes aimingup."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "What the heck is alt nav?"
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Where there was away to have plus move
you up and minus move you down."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "It's under options."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Alternate navigation uses the left side
of your keyboard instead of the numbers. Especially handy for people who don't
have a numb pad and who can't make sense of the number row."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their
seats.
Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to
one side.
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, and, I vaguely remember something
about vipmud and the numb pad but since I never had a numb pad I never
remembered the details."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Janis I think you found a bug with the aim
command. For now, try using /+ or /- to aim straight up and down if you use the
keypad."
Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins
dizzyingly.
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'm going to go ahead and file a ticket
about the aim bug, since I can reproduce it."
The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few
moments.
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Thanks for checking."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "The pain!"
The crowd stands up to jeer. The room seems to spin rapidly around you.
You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "You might also want to try entering the
entire command at once. So instead of "aim" "enter" "+" "enter" you could do
"aim +" enter."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I'm not sure what you mean, I was
just typeing aim + and then hitting enter when I wanted to aim streight up, or
aim +4 or aim +4 if I wanted up and west."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Nothing tended to work."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "With the alt keys what would I do
for up and down?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "With the alt keys it is R for up and F for
down."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Read the help manual starship control
file as well. It may help explain this."
Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to
one side.
You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.
You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept
of time.
You gag slightly.
You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept
of time.
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "However now I'm stuck again sinse I
have no ship and no money."
Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins
dizzyingly.
The heat from the stage light is oppressive.
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I'd rather not take out a lone if I
can avoid it."
You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Get the lone."
You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept
of time.
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "You will make loads of cash soon."
The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few
moments.
The stage lights flicker briefly.
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "You'll make the loan and then some fairly
quickly."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Or talk to people in character and see if
someone is willing to give you a hand."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I'm not making much thus far, I've
had two ships and one suit blown up."
Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins
dizzyingly.
You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept
of time.
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "Talk on general. I'm sure someone
would be glad to help you."
The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few
moments.
The stage lights flicker briefly.
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "My lone got rejected."
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "Argh!"
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I was trying to buy another cargo
hauler so I could at least make money with salvage."
Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins
dizzyingly.
The heat from the stage light is oppressive.
The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few
moments.
The stage lights flicker briefly.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Nope lone rejected."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "This game is getting rather
irritating I have to confess sinse nothing is going right here."
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "Just ask in character. I know I was
a bit busy but others are around too."
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "I'd rather not beg favours
especially ssinse with my luck I'll probably end up having things go wrong
again, I'd love to get into combat and such but it just doesn't seem to work
right."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Most people are glad to help out.
It's alright to ask."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Janis, have you practiced in the
simulator?"
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "I understand the game can have a steap
learning curve, but there are plenty of people who do get the hang of it. But on
this newbie channel there is only so much we can do. Interact with people in
character, roleplay a bit, and see that way if someone can give you a bit of a
hand. And trust me, we all had to learn this game when we started and most of us
were not great at gunning the first day."
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "I promise, if someone steps up and
helps you, things will go much smoother. They can help you get things back on
track."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "What's a simulator?"
Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins
dizzyingly.
You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!
[Newbie Help] Janis Threadstone transmits, "Methinks I should restart this
game."
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Unfortunately, some of us are in
another part of the game and cannot get back in time to help. There should be
other people awake in comms though."
The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few
moments.
The stage lights flicker briefly.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is a ship simulator on Accord. It
really helped me out."
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "Hypothetically what would happen if
the same thing happened though?"
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "A simulated combat craft in which
some choose to learn how to do various types of space combat in."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "And please don't just restart because of
one bad day."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "I'd help you out if I weren't way out
of comms range."
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "We've all had them."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Janis, do you have a mentor?"
Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins
dizzyingly.
You double over in pain, it feels as if it is going to break free at any moment!
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I would help you out but I too am out
of range IC."
The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few
moments.
You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "Ahem don't worry. I will."
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I would help out ask over general and
those of us that are around will gladdly."
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "But I'll keep it in character."
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "As long as you ask on general."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I just graduated myself, so not sure how
much help I would be."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes, just talk to the pilots in
character, make friends and they will be glad to help."
You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "We've tried, but she's gone."

[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "So, question worth asking. With normal
ships, when the rift drive breaks, you have to repair outside the ship. With a
capsule, you can't exit it. Are all the repairs handled inside if it breaks?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yeah, all repairs are inside."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Not that I have encountered this yet,
but it's worth knowing in the future."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Good question. Never had mine break down
yet."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Excellent."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "They break very rarely though."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Wait, you can't even exit a capsule if
you kill life support?"
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "That's awesome."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "You can't kill life support in a capsule."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I do not believe so."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Capsules would be almost unfair to use
for artifact gathering due to their incredible speed. So I believe that was the
purpose of making them non-exitable."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Wouldn't be very balanced compared to
other ships out there."
The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Another fine question, can you put
plants inside them? I assume not since you can't simply drop items in it. But I
did notice if you throw things, it will drop inside. Potentially a bug that
might need looked at."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "You can't put items in capsules
either?"
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "I would imagine no on the plants. If I
understand it correctly the need ducts to grow."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "No."
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "No plants. You can put in a temp drive
though."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "You have to understand how small they
are. There's a seat, and everything inside is incredibly cramped."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I have bolted other things like the
rift sail extender and such."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "They even lack manual controls. So
autopilot only."
[Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Some items are DROP-able, extender being
one of those notable things."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Oh my... so there no good for
exploration, then?"
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Not really. They're good for getting
to point A to point B incredibly fast."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "They're very specialized. If you know
where you want to go, they're great for getting there."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "You can install surveying equipment
and all of that, but in reality, the sensors are very poor and you won't spot
things easily."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It would be useful for say, heading
out to temp stations to check on things, especially if you want to set up a long
range cartography array where you have to visit it again once it's set up and
running to finalize the chart. This will get you there in no time flat."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "And is it actually possible in any ic
way to get other alliance starship rights? I see it under info, but I asume it
isn't possible to get them."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It is, but it hasn't happened for a
very long time to my knowledge."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Let's say a war broke out. In the
past, ship rights have sometimes been used as a capitulation demand."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "So whether that it would happen again
or not, I don't know. It could just be vestigial code, but I suppose it has the
potential for occuring."
Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

eyesockets.
Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's wine time!"
Several miniature snowglobes overtake the truck, chattering among themselves in
tiny voices.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

There appear to be about 4 pilots recently active.
The starship's computer detects:
*Lily Kaise  (A)

Additionally, there is 1 pilot who appear to have their communicators on but
have not recently been active.

Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Almost home."
[General Communication] Cilah Silverthorn transmits, "And, we're home."
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
Melinda Michaels makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits,
"Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

Rogue says, "Woo."
You stand up from a large leather couch.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2046 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Westsouthwest and Very Slightly Down."

Rogue laughs.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Xenological
Solar Temporary Station.
Lily laughs.
The computer reports that the four-person light carrier "Wings" has docked with
League Xenological Solar Temporary Station.

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Asteroid Belt Management Station.
You see a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval dark purple and

[Asteroid Belt Management Station]
This is an asteroid belt management station. Through large transparisteel
windows, you can see the asteroid stations themselves glittering amongst the
tumbling asteroids of the belt. The station managers need never actually visit
these stations, however, instead conducting their business via a number of
terminals.
The four-person mule "Liberator", the one-person runabout "Faster", the
two-person medium transport "Grey Sky", the two-person hardened asteroid hauler
"Kenosha", the vostok-class capsule "Bolt", and the four-person light carrier
"Star Of Destiny" are parked here.
You see an automatic teller machine and Magellan the arachnoid security robot
here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go nowhere.

You peer into a transparisteel doorway into the pilot lounge...
[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending

of the office, and on the wall behind the desk is the framed image of an
advanced AEU battlesuit. The door is open.
You see the Ground Squad Leader terminal, a large metal filing cabinet, a white

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small

wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and

lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
