-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a puff-sleeved strawberry red silk blouse with a sweetheart
neckline and a pair of skinny white low rise jeans. She is also wearing an
orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a
pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, both hands, waist, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello everyone. Eva and myself have returned
from a trip that was a minor exploration success, as we found some new planets
and quite a few space images were taken. However, due to some previous incident
that, until the last moment very few people knew about, Melinda decided not to
actively seek out the followers of Gunarsh and that we would only meet them if
we were to come across them by chance, which did not happen. Now that I have
returned I will attempt to pick things up again. Let's begin with the state of
the corps report for February 17th 2317. 24 days into the term, the AEU has
completed 14 out of 156 total decoy beacon drops (8.97%). The AEU is responsible
for 0 out of 22 total destroyed rats nests (0.0%), and finally the AEU is
responsible for 0 out of 4 total salvage ops (0.0%). This concludes my report
for now, have a nice day! [10:58 22 February 2317 GST]
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello all, I would like to organize an
emergency meeting of the AEU pilots as soon as possible, as Ather and myself
have some matters to discuss, and certain things have occured that we all will
want clarification on. This mostly applies to a comm notice I have recently
received from the Liaison office, but while we are at it, it would be good to
discuss where we see ourselves headed as a pilot corps. Unfortunately, the
soonest available time for me to chair a meeting is Tuesday, February 28th
starting at 23:55. Please let me know whether you are able to make it within the
next 24 hours so I have some time to invite Mr. Lambeth or one of his
representatives to the meeting as well. Thank you. [08:23 24 February 2317 GST]

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a
small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and a pair of tan
suede clogs here.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a puff-sleeved strawberry red silk blouse with a sweetheart
neckline and a pair of skinny white low rise jeans. She is also wearing an
orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a
pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled

diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, both hands, waist, and both feet are left uncovered.

Hi all, I would like to put in a request to please let me know if you see a
spare workbench lying around somewhere. I have unfortunately misplaced it and
would like to recover it as soon as I am able.
Should anyone find it, please send me a letter or call me at 0001-72619. Thanks
very much!
Best,

Author: Ather Jammoa

Greetings pilots!
It is once again that time of the year, time for the resistance party, which
marks the eighth year of working to break free of Outsider control! The
resistance party is most often celebrated on Resistance Day, which is February
28, but I like to have people there early so we can show the resistance film as
soon as the clock strikes midnight! So, you all are invited to join me on the
27th of February, at 23:59 to celebrate this occasion! Come and have some
delightful food, grab a door prize and most important of all, learn all about
the times of the resistance. I hope to see many of you there for what might be a
fun and hopefully educational experience. Formal dress is encouraged, but not
required. However, you should know that members of the Accord have been known to
come to these parties in the past.
When: Monday, February 27 at 23:59
Where: the Torus Restaurant.
Send me letters if you have questions!

Artifact Alpha 777 is once again reconfigured and available for Local
Artifacting and salvaging of grade 20 to 40 Shipwrecks.
To access Artifact Alpha 777, you must have a Rift Drive.
Jump to Mir and then TRAVEL to 777.
Return via the Artifact Alpha 777 Sector itself and TRAVEL to 776 which is
currently two sectors West of Mir.
There is a Salvage Processor available.
A Transmitter with a Recharger is also available.
Should Ifs and Pirates deserve a bit of return fire, there is a Watch Tower
which has repair available.
We will eventually be able to provide Rift Inserters and will appraise you of
that installation when it is available. In the meantime, if you don't have a
rift Drive, travel with a friend!
Enjoy and don't forget to thank Johann and Nicolette for their generous
contributions towards this area.
