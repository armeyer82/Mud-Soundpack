14:50 ["Hellion" Control Room] (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, and a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end here.

15:03 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862", the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243", and the one-person expediter "Black Lotus" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room.

End report."

19:30 This starship has been hit by Praelor Ohaxx 686.

19:30 A high-pitched, wobbling alarm sounds as the hull begins breaking up around you.

19:30 The computer announces, "Crisis alert! Starship destruction imminent. Beginning emergency evacuation of all personnel."

19:30 You are suddenly seized by a powerful EM field and deposited into an escape pod.

19:31 Hadron the droid says in a digitized voice, "I have begun following."

19:31 The sound of strained components echos throughout the pod. It sounds as if it's going to break apart altogether.

19:31 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Flight control in Dombrowski, somebody just got destroyed out there. Judging by the floating entrails, I'm guessing it wasn't one of ours..."

19:31 [General Communication] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "Down."

19:31 With one final burst of acceleration, the pod emerges from the wormhole and begins accelerating through space under the power of the relativity drive.

19:31 [General Communication] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "Landed that is."

19:31 [General Communication] Anton Navarro transmits, "Excellent."

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site.

20:31 ["Vis Vindico" Weapons Room 7]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. A tall red freestanding fan is emanating a cool breeze throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a comfortable dark gray suede combat chair, an intricate scarlet ceramic sculpture of a bardenium cannon, and a tall red freestanding fan here.

21:21 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:21 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

21:21 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:21 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

21:21 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:21 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:21 The starship is already moving.

21:21 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:21 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:21 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

21:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Hellion. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

21:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:21 You remove part of your armor from a gray armor storage bag and put it on.

21:21 A gray armor storage bag

21:21 This spacious gray bag is quite flexible, allowing it to contain a great deal of armor, ranging from light to heavy.
You see a glossy white lightly armored helmet inside.

21:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

21:21 [Private | Miriam Valleris] Miriam Valleris transmits, "And now, i'm back in 12. I didn't think we'd get out of there so fast!"

21:22 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "Yeah, I'm back on my capitol planet."

21:22 For a top, you are wearing a glossy white lightly armored top over a celestial blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a glossy white lightly armored bottom over a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread and a pair of white cotton tapered boxers under that. You have a glossy white lightly armored helmet on your head. You are wearing a pair of glossy white lightly armored gloves on your hands and a pair of glossy white lightly armored boots over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black stun armor storage bag, and a gray armor storage bag.

21:22 You are carrying an empty mug in your right hand.

21:22 A glossy white lightly armored helmet

21:22 This glossy white helmet appears to have been reinforced with some kind of rigid material. It looks very solid, as if it could withstand a number of attacks.

21:24 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

21:24 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

21:27 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

21:48 You peer out and see...

21:48 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

21:48 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

21:48 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862", the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243", and the one-person expediter "Black Lotus" powered down here.

21:52 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862", the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243", and the one-person expediter "Black Lotus" powered down here.

Towering trees dot the area, their branches hanging low with reddish gold apples. To the north, a narrow break in the trees leads off to a shaded path. To the south, a wide trail indicates a primitive road. The only other sign of modernization is the tall tower of rock rising into the sky off to the east. An open archway leads into the structure.

23:17 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pax; Neutral Docking Bay.

23:45 Emily Mcmanomy has wandered away from your group.

23:46 You peer out and see...

23:46 [Empanda Station; Public Garage]
Large robotic arms are constantly in motion transporting starships to and from the overhead docking bay in this cavernous starship garage. The echo from the launching and landing of ships reverberates off the concrete walls, creating a cacophony of sound when combined with the mechanical whirl of the busy sanitation drones that dart among the powered down starships. Blue and white lines have been painted onto the stone floor, serving as markings to keep the ships in some semblance of organization. Every so often, one of the large metallic arms will pick up a starship and transfer it to another area of the garage to optimize the available space.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
