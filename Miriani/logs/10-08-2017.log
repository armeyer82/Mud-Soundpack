03:16 Garages
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Garages are structures that allow safe and convenient storage of your starship when you're not using it.

  Usage:
To place your ship in a garage, you simply power it down on the landing pad of a planet that is equipped with a garage. The following commands can be used on a landing pad to manipulate garages:

TRANSPORT <ship name> - This command allows you to put an unpowered ship into a garage or, if you're in the garage yourself, move a ship to the landing pad. If you don't specify a ship name, you will receive a length list of all possible ships to transport.

REQUEST <ship name> ON KEYRING - This command allows you to transport your ship from the garage without that lengthy walk to transport it.

My dearest Love,
Well it has likewise come the time for me to tell you that if you were being truthful to me, all along, then you wouldn't truly be a coward that you are being and run away and leave piloting behind. Yes you cheated with a cheater so you got what you truly deserved now. I hope I never find your mistress alone as now I will truly get revenge for destroying as she obviously has or you would come back to me. She has brainwashed you so horribly as well. You wer cheating on me before that night that you faked a breakup with me to try to cover yourself. You obviously had contact with her and a plan to move in. That is cheating as who knows how long and then you moved in with her in some other man's home. That is so disgusting and so disrespectful of the spirit and to the owner of the property especially if it is a boyfriend or former boyfriend.
So either come back to me and face me or be on your way Tibo Beauchene or the memory I will have of you will be only of a cheater who wouldn't admit to his wrongs, a coward who wouldn't hold himself accountable for his stupid mistakes in judgement and obviously one who couldn't encourage a decent woman like me to trust him and consumate her love with you. At least i would be correct in that you would prove yourself untrustworthy.
I offered to forgive you and to make an effort to be with you one on one to work out our differences. Cowards only run and hide behind their broken promises and lies though rather than face those whom they have hurt.
I always felt that you were hiding something and I know now that you are just a user whom i obviously couldn't resist so that is my fault for allowing it. If you weren't, you would be back in my arms. I suppose there is some remote glint of guilt on your behalf there which means that you perhaps do have some sense of ethics and values because you are so compeled to run away and throw your career away. Rather than to go forward and admit to your wrongs and apologize to me.
You lashed out at me for your problems too which means you still can't see through your own lack of accountability. I am the one you can trust the most though but it's so painful that you would blame me rather than admit it that you yourself are responsible for your failures.
it's sad for you Tibo Beauchene and my heart will miss you forever but we pilots certainly don't need another dishonest cheater amongst us women who only desire a good and honest companion. I wanted to marry you and I still do but my intuition told me I should wait and I am so right that you haven't the decency to face me.
I will say to you one last time, that the door is still open and especially for you to come back to me and prove that I am wrong. One other thing Tibo though is you are to show me that you are truly a man of integrity. You will also cease blaming me for what others do to you as well. You k
03:21 now Tibo,you just don't realize who your friends truly are as well and especially that I am not a cheater like Miriam Valleris who cheted on her boyfriend to break us up. If you come back to me, I will leave her to her miserable life sleeping around with any man she wants though. She truly has the blackest heart and soul as she has no comprehension of guilt for the destruction in her path.
I will be sad forever Tibo and I may never get over it if you don't come back and at least try to work things out with me. Still, if you won't, I can't blame myself for your turning your back on me and running away to cover your wrongs.
I still love you with my heart because true love never dies.
Kitty

04:00 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, and a dark blue suede sofa here.

04:14 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

11:50 Mekensie the droid

11:50 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is wearing a blue cotton flower-print sundress.  She is wearing a pair of black leather high heels with streaks of silver in them on her feet. She is also wearing a green keychain with "The WildHorse Saloon" printed on it.

Droids
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Droids are humanoid robots that follow you around to do your bidding. Most models exist solely to protect you, but in addition to that they also possess the ability to store items and, most important of all, tell you the time and date.

  Commanding Droids:
To command a droid, you simply speak the droid's name followed by the command you wish to give. For example, to instruct your droid, Noodle, to follow you, you would type:

say Noodle, follow.

Or your favorite variation of the say command.

  Standard Droid Functions:

Add [person] - Add a person to the droids friends list.
Remove [person/clothing] - Remove the person from the droids friends list or removes the clothing specified.
Friends - List the droids friends.
Authorise [person] - Allow  to command the droid.
Deauthorise [person] - Remove  from droid command list.
Owners - Lists who can control the droid.
Get [item] - Attempts to pick up an item.
Drop [item] - Drops [item]
Give [item] to [person] - Gives [item] to [person]
Contents - Lists the droids contents.
Holding - Tells what the droid is holding without telling what it has stored.
Store [item] - Stores [item] in droids storage compartment.
Unstore [item] - Retrieves [item] from storage.
Wear [item] - Dons [item].
Follow - Follows you around. Or stops following you around.
Remote - Enables remote mode.
Charge - Causes the droid to announce its currently charge level.
Time/Date - Informs you of the time and date.
Put [key] on [keychain] - Places a key on a keychain if your droid is wearing one.
Keys - Tells you what keys your droid has on its keyring.
Invalidate - Unlinks the droid from its remote in the event that it gets lost. Standard replacement remotes can then be LINKed to the droid.
Disc - Loads or unloads a video disc to record your droid's camera output. To properly record, the droid's camera must be active and it must have recording enabled. EM pulses will disable the recording functionality and it must be re-enabled after the droid recovers.

[Amalthea; Landing Pad]
Towering mountains surround and embrace the valley where this landing pad rests, their peaks invisible far above. Caves of all sizes cut into the mountains, some natural, others appearing to be man made or at least modified. The landing pad itself is little more than a flat area of gravel, carefully cleared out to provide a safe place for landing.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go south and out.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, a dark blue suede sofa, Kalista the droid, a slim blue medical drone, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.

Droids
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Droids are humanoid robots that follow you around to do your bidding. Most models exist solely to protect you, but in addition to that they also possess the ability to store items and, most important of all, tell you the time and date.

  Commanding Droids:
To command a droid, you simply speak the droid's name followed by the command you wish to give. For example, to instruct your droid, Noodle, to follow you, you would type:

say Noodle, follow.

Or your favorite variation of the say command.

  Standard Droid Functions:

Add [person] - Add a person to the droids friends list.
Remove [person/clothing] - Remove the person from the droids friends list or removes the clothing specified.
Friends - List the droids friends.
Authorise [person] - Allow  to command the droid.
Deauthorise [person] - Remove  from droid command list.
Owners - Lists who can control the droid.
Get [item] - Attempts to pick up an item.
Drop [item] - Drops [item]
Give [item] to [person] - Gives [item] to [person]
Contents - Lists the droids contents.
Holding - Tells what the droid is holding without telling what it has stored.
Store [item] - Stores [item] in droids storage compartment.
Unstore [item] - Retrieves [item] from storage.
Wear [item] - Dons [item].
Follow - Follows you around. Or stops following you around.
Remote - Enables remote mode.
Charge - Causes the droid to announce its currently charge level.
Time/Date - Informs you of the time and date.
Put [key] on [keychain] - Places a key on a keychain if your droid is wearing one.
Keys - Tells you what keys your droid has on its keyring.
Invalidate - Unlinks the droid from its remote in the event that it gets lost. Standard replacement remotes can then be LINKed to the droid.
Disc - Loads or unloads a video disc to record your droid's camera output. To properly record, the droid's camera must be active and it must have recording enabled. EM pulses will disable the recording functionality and it must be re-enabled after the droid recovers.

Standard Security Droid

18:16 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

20:11 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, a dark blue suede sofa, a slim blue medical drone, Mekensie the droid, and Kalista the droid here.
You can go south and out.

20:11 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:11 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:12 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:12 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

20:12 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:12 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:12 The eight-person gunship "Mischief" has jumped into the sector.

20:12 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:39 ["Mischief" Living Quarters]
You see nothing special. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and a large rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Caelum; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a light yellow rose bush set in a medium sized pot, an ocean blue glass cafe table, a beach cupboard, a white porcelain double sink, a turquoise beech wood counter, a cherry wood trash bin, a periwinkle wooden snack table, a comfortable peach suede sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a teakwood coffee table, a tall robotic butler, a turquoise refrigerator, a violet trash bin, and a bright turquoise cooler here.
You see Kitty Mars here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and up.

["Mischief" Control Room] (buckled into a velvet recliner)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Caelum; Docking Bay.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy brig

20:41 Kitty Mars glides down.

20:42 You peer out and see...

20:42 [Caelum; Docking Bay]
This seems to be a heavily fortified docking bay. Robotic arms occasionally can be seen bringing ships to and from the garage. Repair drones can be seen sprinting quickly from the repair facility to service ships in need of repair. A star is sketched in the center of the docking bay with the name Kerry Calderon engraved in the center.
You see a blue pole-mounted welcome neon sign here.
You can go northwest, west, and down.

20:43 You say, "kalista deauthorize kitty"

20:43 Kalista the droid says in a charming voice, "Kitty Mars can control me no more."

20:43 You say, "kalista remove kitty"

20:43 Kalista the droid says in a charming voice, "I have removed Kitty Mars from my friends list."

20:43 Kitty Mars glides in from down.

20:43 Kitty Mars sits down on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt.

20:43 Kitty Mars
She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This 35 year old woman stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall and is thin with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a soft baby blue silk short sleeve peasant blouse over a hot pink embroidered bra. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of snug blue jeans with elaborate diamond patterns on the back pockets over a pair of hot pink satin bikini underwear. She is wearing a pair of multi colored clogs on her feet. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a violet spacesuit jet, a pink flight control scanner, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a cute tortie cat backpack, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a deep purple leather briefcase, a transparent wristwatch, a pink armor storage bag, a sleek hot pink repair kit, 
20:43 a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, a metallic purple padded leather silk-lined mandolin case, a purple diving gear bag, a violet rolled toolkit, an archaeological artifact storage container, a level ten archaeological dig site scanner, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a lilac snuggly, a small handheld radio receiver, a vivid purple and white mesh beach bag, a powder pink snuggly holding an orange tabby kitten, and a high-capacity pink Lore computer.
She is carrying nothing.

20:54 Last ten announcements:
[06/27/17 - 4:39 p.m.] Announcement: Final call for host applications will be this Friday, June 30 at 12 CDT. So if you're planning on submitting one, get to work. Anything submitted past the cutoff will be automatically rejected, owing to the fact that it wasn't prior to the deadline.
[06/29/17 - 4:15 p.m.] Announcement: This is the final call for host applicants. We're looking for builders, event planners and programmers. If you think you've got what it takes, be sure to submit your application by Friday, June 30 by no later than 12 noon CDT. See message board post 87729 for requirements and instructions. As always, if you have questions, feel free to assist.
[07/01/17 - 1:14 p.m.] Announcement: A friendly warning that blowing up starships or otherwise taking advantage of circumstances presented to you by a server crash is heavily frowned upon. If people don't have a chance to reawaken and move themselves to somewhere safe, please do not destroy or steal their property. Typically, you should give someone at least an 8 to 12 hour window due to timezone differences to reconnect and move themselves to safety. Any instances of this happening will result in any in character gains being reversed, as well as the property restored to the victim. Thank you.
[07/01/17 - 1:17 p.m.] Announcement: And on the subject of server crashes, there was a minor rollback last night. If you lost any progress, please feel free to ASSIST to get it restored. I predict the issue causing panics will not occur again, but you never know!
[07/03/17 - 3:50 p.m.] Announcement: Hello everyone. I would primarily like to thank you all for participating in my first event! It was an overwhelming success (no one interject!) and I look forward to spicing up the Miriani plot. Myself, and perhaps a few friends will see you all July 5th.
[08/17/17 - 4:43 p.m.] Announcement: For those out of the loop, the Miriani fireside chat is now going on. To join, simply type @OOC. If you have no idea what this is, check OOC / announcements on your message board reader.
[08/30/17 - 3:19 a.m.] Announcement: Hello, night players! For really exciting maintenance reasons, we need to reboot the server. Please get to a safe location to avoid getting kidnapped and/or destroyed. Shutdown will be around 3:30 AM (8/30/17). Downtime isn't expected to last more than 10 minutes, but we could get really unlucky. Thanks for understanding!
[09/19/17 - 1:02 p.m.] Announcement: Happy Pirate Day! To celebrate this most auspicious occasion, we are digging up some treasure chests and littering them on various planets and space stations. These chests can contain anything from a rubber chicken to a trillion solid gold credits. You never know! To see who has the biggest booty, as it were, you can type: @TOP-PIRATES. Good luck!
[09/28/17 - 7:21 p.m.] Announcement: Sorry everybody, apparently I wrecked the dig site 
20:54 on Mercury. We're going to have to look at a backup to pull the artifact listing to get everything back to how it should be, which may be a while. So sorry for the inconvenience.
[09/29/17 - 3:39 p.m.] Announcement: The archaeology site on Mercury is back up and running. Huge thanks go out to Victor for hoarding logs like a winner.
End of announcements.

Hello!

After much deliberation, we're instituting something many of you probably doubted would ever grace the world of Miriani. As a further push into the modern era, GROUP-OPTIONS have been added, which allow you to control who can hold you or begin following you, as well as your automated response to group requests. To access them, type GROUP-OPTIONS (or, for the lazy, JOIN-O works too). The choices are quite self-explanatory, but some things should be noted:

* Idle means inactive for 3 minutes or more. If you're staring into space, you're vulnerable.
* If you're stunned you can be held or joined without consent. (This also applies for roundtime.)
* You can give specific people the ability to bypass your group settings by adding them to the lists accessible in menu options 1 and 2.
* We'll be cracking down rather strongly on people who use scripts designed to keep you from idling to circumvent mechanics. Keep it fair!

Spaceports have also received a facelift. By facelift, I mean that any public spaceport on a well-populated planet now has a jamming field. This jamming field, which is omnipresent and always there much like those neighbors that feel the need to const
20:57 antly hang out on your lawn, will stop any civilian weapon fire. Thanks to special chips installed in military personnel's sidearms, jamming easily discriminates between the two. If you're in any inside room (in a spaceport, mind you), droids, drones and handheld weapons will not be able to fire stun shots. Pulse emitter usage is still permitted.

Inside room, you ask? Yes, inside room. Every room in the game's world has been designated by hard-working builders as indoors or outdoors. You can see whether a room is outdoors by reading the description or, for the lazy, there is now a new option to show outside status in the room title. This is also being used for upcoming systems that are right around the corner, like weather. Keep a close eye on the Development Ramblings board to find out what's going on behind the scenes.

I think that's everything! If you have any questions, feel free to ASSIST or drop us a line at hosts@toastsoft.net.

P.s. We're now back on Twitter! We'll be using this to post changes, announcements, and system status updates. Be sure to follow @toastsoft for your daily helping of Miriani on social media.

21:02 ["Mischief" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a wide poster of a lush tropical landscape with colorful flowering trees and dozens of tropical birds hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a medium bright purple antique rug, a cherry wood table, an enormous purple beanbag chair, a pink starship simulator, a mat white wooden hanging planter, and a multicolor striped beanbag chair here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and down.

["Mischief" Control Room] (buckled into a velvet recliner)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

21:22 Kitty Mars
She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This 35 year old woman stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall and is thin with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a soft baby blue silk short sleeve peasant blouse over a hot pink embroidered bra. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of snug blue jeans with elaborate diamond patterns on the back pockets over a pair of hot pink satin bikini underwear. She is wearing a pair of multi colored clogs on her feet. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a violet spacesuit jet, a pink flight control scanner, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a cute tortie cat backpack, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a deep purple leather briefcase, a transparent wristwatch, a pink armor storage bag, a s
21:22 leek hot pink repair kit, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, a metallic purple padded leather silk-lined mandolin case, a purple diving gear bag, a violet rolled toolkit, an archaeological artifact storage container, a level ten archaeological dig site scanner, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a lilac snuggly, a small handheld radio receiver, a vivid purple and white mesh beach bag, a powder pink snuggly holding an orange tabby kitten, and a high-capacity pink Lore computer.
She is carrying nothing.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise.

22:10 Kalista the droid

22:10 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is wearing a red cotton star-print sundress.  She is wearing a pair of white leather high heels with streaks of gold in them on her feet. She is also wearing a purple keychain with "The WildHorse Saloon" printed on it.

22:10 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is wearing a red cotton star-print sundress.  She is wearing a pair of white leather high heels with streaks of gold in them on her feet. She is also wearing a purple keychain with "The WildHorse Saloon" printed on it.
She is carrying nothing.
