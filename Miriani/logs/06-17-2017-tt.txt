Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced
with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and
the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air,
thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash
bin, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas
sneakers, and a pair of soft dark pink slippers here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go east.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar
and cuffs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes,
both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

Subject: It's All Over
Author: voyager1000
Posted: Sat Jun 17 15:20:24 2017 UTC

Hi everyone,
For those who don't know, I was approached by the police in December of 2014 and
asked to testify in court.
The last two and a half years of waiting were some of the worst times I've
experienced, then I was called on Monday and asked to travel, then give my
evidence on Wednesday.
So it's finally all over. I've not said much as it's not the sort of thing I
want to talk about, though the court experience was not as bad as I thought it
was going to be.
I know some players here know little bits and pieces, and thanks to them for
their support. To the rest of you, thank you for helping me stay sane. Well as
sane as a Geordie can ever be.
The player of Emily.

Melinda Michaels strolls in from the east.
Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw
pillow and a black throw pillow on it.
Melinda Michaels dangles a hot cheeseburger with the works in front of a Tardick
lizard named Zeus. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, but it seems
surprisingly uninterested. Perhaps it's actually full.
Melinda Michaels says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus, "Fine then."
Melinda Michaels gives a hot cheeseburger with the works to Tegan the small
circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.
Emily Ford says, "Wasting cheeseburgers on lizards, how terrible."

Melinda Michaels says, "I am a terrible person."
Emily Ford says, "Yes, you are. I trained you well."
Melinda Michaels grins.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's
neck.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
Melinda Michaels says, "Giddyup."
Emily Ford says, "Fatal things can kill you, you know."
Emily Ford takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.
Melinda Michaels asks, "Really?"
Emily Ford says, "Yeah."
Emily Ford says, "Don't worry, I'll keep on teaching you this stuff."
Emily Ford pats Melinda Michaels on the back.
Melinda Michaels grins. "Thank you so very much."
Emily Ford says, "Pleasure."
Emily nods sagely.
Emily Ford finishes off a glass of chilled orange juice.

A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in OOC/General/All.
Emily Ford asks, "What calm?"
Melinda Michaels says, "We hit a bit of a calm last night and into early this
morning. Like the calm we go in once we hit the Spinward clan area."
Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "The flow was
under 2000 for quite a spell."
Emily Ford nods.

Melinda Michaels says, "Our distance traveled."
Emily says to Damien, "I was asking how far we travelled before turning around."
Damien Goss says, "Oh, 1972 light years."
Melinda says to Damien, "Was that before we turned coreward?"
Emily Ford asks, "We didn't manage twenty-eight more?"
Damien Goss nods. "We turned cause the flow was completely against us or close
enough that it would have taken many hours to reach the 2000 light year mark."
Melinda says to Damien, "We still went up after turning coreward so, probably
1980 light-years, give or take."
Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.
Damien Goss says, "Perhaps, I'm not sure how much vertical we travelled on the
coreward heading, but we had just passed 1 LTC when we turned and we need about
5 to reach 2000."
Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "I think."
Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy
application and peers at the screen.
Emily Ford says, "That's a shame, that happened on the first antispinward trip.
We left Feng Wo with the intention of hitting a thousand, only to have the flow

Melinda Michaels says, "Go me, no math even."
Melinda Michaels grins.
Damien Goss gives Melinda Michaels a thumbs up!

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy
printed on the chest and a pair of soft light blue slippers. She is also wearing
an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet
of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a
pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a
perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Dearest Lily,
There are many things I will cherish regarding my pilot life. All of the
experiences have taught me valuable lessons and helped me grow as a person.
Above all, I will remember the time we spent together. However, I feel it's time
for my career to come to a close.
Upon our return to beacon space, I will send in my resignation as GSL and will
leave the pilot corps forever.
Thank you for being such a wonderful friend, confident, and most of all, lover.
I wish and hope the best for you in your piloting career. I love you and you
will always  hold a special place in my heart and there will never be another
for me. Please keep the ring I gave you as a constant reminder of my love that
will encircle you regardless of where you go. Take care and may your dreams
carry you to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
