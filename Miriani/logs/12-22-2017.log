02:43 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "With you two I'd only need two more."

02:43 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:43 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:44 [General Communication] Nicholas Prescott transmits, "There would be no point, then, would there?"

02:44 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:44 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:44 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:44 You suddenly notice the absence of cookies as the smell of cotton candy wafts into the room.

02:58 ["Magical Melody" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy brown carpet. You see a painting entitled "Candy Rain" hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

02:58 ["Magical Melody" Weapons Room 2]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy brown carpet. You see a twinkling strand of purple and silver lights hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here.

02:58 ["Magical Melody" Engineering Room] (indoors)
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy brown carpet. You see a tapestry depicting lush green hills rolling into the sunset and a twinkling strand of blue lights hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

14:16 [Apartment 251270; Master Bedroom] (indoors) (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread)
You see a cozy little bedroom with carpet floors and drywall walls. The walls are painted red. A glass rose with a soft orange light inside is casting a warm soft orange light throughout the room.
You see two large curved antique cherry bedside tables, an antique black wrought iron tiered candelabra holding four slender crimson taper candles, a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread, a large soft red and white heart shaped area rug, a large marble fireplace with a stone hearth and a cherrywood mantel, two overstuffed bright white suede recliners, a red heart-shaped air freshener, and a small bamboo bassinet lined with ivory soft padding and covered with a sunshine yellow canopy here.
You see Miriam Valleris (staring into space) (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread) here.
You can go east.

14:16 You lean in toward Miriam Valleris and gently kiss her lips.

21:07 [Apartment 251270; Master Bedroom] (indoors) (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread)
You see a cozy little bedroom with carpet floors and drywall walls. The walls are painted red. A glass rose with a soft orange light inside is casting a warm soft orange light throughout the room.
You see two large curved antique cherry bedside tables, an antique black wrought iron tiered candelabra holding four slender crimson taper candles, a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread, a large soft red and white heart shaped area rug, a large marble fireplace with a stone hearth and a cherrywood mantel, two overstuffed bright white suede recliners, a red heart-shaped air freshener, and a small bamboo bassinet lined with ivory soft padding and covered with a sunshine yellow canopy here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread) here, sleeping.
You can go east.

21:08 A red heart-shaped air freshener freshens the room with the scent of roses.

21:12 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Sure I'll gun."

21:12 [General Communication] Moiraine Yobi transmits, "I am not. Erik is."

21:12 [General Communication] Cody Williams transmits, "That won't happen."

21:12 [General Communication] Avery Terner transmits, "Me?"

21:12 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "I do think you should fly one mo."

21:12 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Have you actually flown any of your own diffs?"

21:13 #$#soundpack_pong

21:13 #$#soundpack_lag 106

21:13 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Like, why did you get a BC only to have Erik fly all of your missions for you?"

21:13 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Come on."

21:13 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "I say you should cuz I believe your capable of it and it'd be a godo confadence boost."

21:13 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "That too."

21:14 #$#soundpack_pong

21:14 #$#soundpack_lag 112

21:14 [General Communication] Moiraine Yobi transmits in a calm voice, "Noah, please. I am asking politely that you leave our choices, because it is a choice Erik and I make together. I am asking that you leave our choices about who pilots when we run missions out of this. If you do not wish to go, then fine. Don't go. But please leave our choices out of it. I asked who wanted to go. People who want to go, great. People who don't, that's fine."

21:14 #$#soundpack social | calm | female

21:14 [General Communication] Avery Terner transmits, "Can I?"

21:14 [General Communication] Moiraine Yobi transmits brightly, "You may!"

21:14 #$#soundpack social | bright | female

21:14 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "I think I speak for everyone when I say that even if you don't do well, at least you tried. Not trying at all is much less respectable than if you try and screw up. We all need to learn somewhere. And I will not respect your choices, because you are now a BC pilot and having other BC pilots do your dirty work that you are supposedly skilled enough to do yourself is wrong."

21:15 [General Communication] Michael Johnson transmits, "Now now, calm down."

21:15 [General Communication] Michael Johnson transmits, "As he said."

21:16 #$#soundpack_lag 111

21:16 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Normally I'm not one to agree with noah, but I would love to see mo fly a diff and its something I believe she's capable of doing."

21:16 [General Communication] Beatrice Carmichael transmits, "I must agree here. Why even take the BC test if others will fly your BC."

21:16 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Like, in all seriousness - I am trying to understand this. Why did you get a BC? Why do you even run your "own" missions if Erik is the one that pilots every single one? Why not just let him run his own."

21:17 #$#soundpack_pong

21:17 #$#soundpack_lag 103

21:17 [General Communication] Cara West transmits, "I also agree. Why have another pilot who can fly his own bc fly your bc. Then what's the sense in having your own if you won't take it up and fly your own."

21:17 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Running a new diff with distraction is even easier then flying a gunship diff in my oppinion."

21:17 [General Communication] Beatrice Carmichael transmits, "Then there are the people hwo have bc's just to have them, but won't run missions."

21:17 [General Communication] Moiraine Yobi transmits, "When I offer to run and say I would like to start with an older diff no one wants to go. It is either the random diffs or not at all. So honestly, and since even Erik has blown up flying a random diff, I think someone's belief that they do not have the practice to fly that is not wrong. I have offered my bc several times in invasions and I would continue to do that because there is more to having a license than just flying diffs or not flying them."

21:17 [General Communication] Moiraine Yobi transmits, "I have never once, when I was alert, hesitated to offer my ship for invasions. And last time I checked, that was what the application talked most about, protecting known space. And I do that."

21:18 #$#soundpack_pong

21:18 [General Communication] Beatrice Carmichael transmits, "I like older diffs better."

21:18 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Does anyone else want to go on an older diff?"

21:18 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "I'd go on old ones if you fly mo."

21:18 [General Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "I'd go, perhaps."

21:18 [General Communication] Moiraine Yobi transmits, "Oh and then there's the fact that when we do actually offer to run whether I offer to fly or not, people say they take too long and would prefer mods instead. So I get a little discouraged when I even try."

21:18 [General Communication] Alexander Martellato transmits, "I can eng."

21:19 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Well we're getting crew for your old diffs, so let's do this."

21:19 [General Communication] Joseph Navarro transmits, "I'd go if it meant someone practicing their skills at flying and actually using their bc, sure."

21:19 [General Communication] Avery Terner transmits, "Long normally means more profet if I am correct."

21:19 [General Communication] Cody Williams transmits, "It doesn't."

21:19 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Sacrifice profit for her practice."

21:19 [General Communication] Beatrice Carmichael transmits, "I would like to go, but I am out of locals, and do not feel like jumping bak. My apologies."
