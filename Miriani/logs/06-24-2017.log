[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

00:24 You put a droid remote titled "acrylon" in a black leather briefcase.

00:24 You can't launch from here.

00:24 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:24 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

00:24 I don't understand that.

00:24 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:24 Via general sector communication, Acrylon Courier Transport 5363 transmits greetings.

00:24 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:24 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

00:45 You peer out and see...

00:45 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

00:45 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

00:45 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

00:45 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862", the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243", and the eight-person gunship "Hellion" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the six-person dart "Unexplored Destiny", the three-person freighter "Golden Dawn", and the three-person freighter "Shimmering Rose" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley

02:48 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

03:58 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

03:58 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

03:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:58 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

03:58 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

03:58 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

03:58 [Short-range Communication] David Arther transmits, "How about mods?"

03:58 [Short-range Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "My dolphin."

03:58 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

03:58 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

03:58 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

03:58 A high-capacity transparent Lore computer beeps quietly, indicating that its TransLink tracking functionality has been activated.

03:58 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

03:58 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:58 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:58 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

03:58 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

06:00 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

06:00 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

06:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

06:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

06:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

06:00 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

06:01 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

16:48 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

16:48 For a top, you are wearing a celestial blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a black stun armor storage bag, and a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

20:07 ["Fatal Destiny" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You can go south, up, and out.

20:08 [Private | Britney Chance] You transmit, "Heh, I don't even have a bed in that ship you and I hung out in."

20:09 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

20:09 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

20:09 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

20:09 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:09 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

20:09 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:09 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:09 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:09 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:09 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

20:09 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:09 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

20:09 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:09 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:09 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:09 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:09 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

20:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

20:10 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

20:10 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

20:10 You peer out and see...

20:10 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
