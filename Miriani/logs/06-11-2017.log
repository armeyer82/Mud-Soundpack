00:14 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

02:38 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "I'm going to try to head back to the apartment. Hopefully, there are no automated laser turrets."

02:39 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:39 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

02:39 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:39 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

02:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:39 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:40 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:40 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:40 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:40 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.

02:40 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:40 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

02:40 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:40 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

02:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:40 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has docked with Empanda Station.

02:40 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:40 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

15:09 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.

You can go south and out.

15:10 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

15:10 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

15:10 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

15:10 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

15:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:10 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:10 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:10 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:10 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:10 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

15:10 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:10 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:10 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

15:10 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:10 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:11 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:11 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:11 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:11 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:11 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

15:11 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

15:11 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

15:11 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the five-person transverser "Soli Deo Gloria", and the eight-person gunship "Dream of The Return" landed here.

15:23 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.

19:51 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Outreach Asteroid Mining Outpost; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a leather-covered oak navigator's chair, a metallic white starship simulator, an overstuffed royal blue leather love seat, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
