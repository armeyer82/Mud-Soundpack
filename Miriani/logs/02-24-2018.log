01:38 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.

02:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

02:06 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:06 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:06 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:06 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:06 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Jumpgate to Central Jumpgate Hub.

02:37 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

02:37 Select a ship:

02:37 [Chatter] Taleila Castle transmits, "Franklin, you sure enjoy singing! Are you happy about something?"

02:37 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:37 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:37 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:37 [Chatter] Scott Franklin transmits, "I just like singing."

02:37 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.
A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:37 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:37 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:37 You stand up.

02:37 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

02:37 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:37 [Chatter] Leeann Whitlock transmits, "And bubbling."

02:37 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

02:37 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:37 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

02:38 [Chatter] Leeann Whitlock laughs.

02:38 #$#soundpack social | laugh | female

02:38 The starship is already moving.

02:38 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (dozing) (sitting on a dark blue suede co-captain's chair) here.
You can go south.

02:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:38 [Chatter] Cody Meynoso transmits, "Fucking guy will just sit there and make bubbling noises at you."

02:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:38 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:38 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

You see nothing special. You see a small flat disc containing the image of Santa Claus hanging on the wall.
You see EmmyLou the droid, Estelle the droid, a massive sandstone fireplace with a mosaic tile hearth and a teakwood mantel, a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses and a coral ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte gold lamp, a translucent architectural design simulator, a shiny purple starship simulator, a stack of neatly split logs, a red-haired female nanny bot, an orange and white cat, a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, and a tall robotic butler here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (dozing) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, east, and south.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a low turquoise crew chair here.

[Rolukssica; Flattened Landing Area]
The entire area has been bulldozed to create a mostly flat landing site. The smell of fresh soil couples with the stench of hot starships and the scent of industrial chemicals. In the distance, you can see the gleaming Alliance High Guard Complex jutting into the sky. Off to the side, you notice two pieces of recently constructed equipment. The first appears to be an enormous planetary defense laser of some kind. The second facility is slightly less comprehensible, though the surplus of refined cardenium stored around it suggests it's a power generation facility. There is a short path a brisk walk to the south and evidence suggests that a massive concrete pit has been dug a short way off. Judging by the amount of ships being lifted by cranes, it is likely a garage facility of some sort.
You see the four-person short-range troop transport "Magnanimous" landed here.
You see Eeky the droid, Tut the droid, Monkey the droid, a sneaky-looking sanitation drone, and a compact gray sanitation drone here.
You can go northeast, south, and down.

16:12 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
