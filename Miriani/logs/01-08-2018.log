Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room.

["Passionate Blaze" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa, a pale cream granite coffee table, a comfortable dark blue recliner with a sleek electronic device balanced on one arm, a wide black air hockey table, an indoor gold fountain with a stream of water flowing from an angel's halo, three glossy pink security drones, a jet black box with a glowing snowflake on top, a pink architectural design simulator, and Sakura West here.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, and a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in 
02:10 space.
You see an internal stun turret tucked into a corner, an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats resting against the back wall, an antique white animal fur futon with a rustic animal print blanket draped across the back resting against the left wall, an antique white mahogany tea table surrounded by elegant golden thrones in the center of the room, a gold trash bin tucked into a corner, a furry white Bear skin area rug in front of a massive marble fireplace with a mahogany hearth and a mosaic tile mantel, a tall white marble entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen nex to an antique white mahogany tea table surrounded by elegant golden thrones, a massive marble fireplace with a mahogany hearth and a mosaic tile mantel looming at the front of the room, a mahogany coffee table in the corner between an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats and an antique white animal fur futon with a rustic animal print blanket draped across the back with a delicate crystal vase holding lilies mixed with orchids and daffodils tied at the stems with white satin ribbon sitting on top of it, three glossy blue security drones, a shiny gold starship simulator, a low blue marble garden fountain with water streaming from the hands of an angel kneeling in its basin bubbling quietly against the right wall, a gold comfortable padded baby bouncer seat with an ove

02:50 ["Passionate Blaze" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa, a pale cream granite coffee table, a comfortable dark blue recliner with a sleek electronic device balanced on one arm, a wide black air hockey table, an indoor gold fountain with a stream of water flowing from an angel's halo, three glossy pink security drones, and a jet black box with a glowing snowflake on top here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, and a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly hanging on the wall.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, and a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly hanging on the wall.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, and a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, y
13:10 ou see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

17:22 Moiraine Yobi says, "I think the problem is that there are things that you can do without having the license point for them. Like for example, fly a ship with upgrades you're not qualified for. Let say a person is friends iwth a pilot who has drive optimization, or even easier like slip drive or whatever. They fly using slip drive everytime they are in that person ship becausee it's there. But when there'ss a thing you can't do, it''s like heyy nnot fair, but really, it'ss just."

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, and a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, and a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

23:50 Brianna West
She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This slender woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 8 inches tall with an ample bust size. Her heart-shaped face bears a light golden tan complexion. Her silky waist-length, honey blonde hair is dusted with gold glitter. She has expressive celestial blue eyes with an elegant button nose above a set of full, pouty lips which part to reveal sparkling white, perfectly straight teeth. Her abdomen is very large and rounded, appearing to have shifted lower on her frame. She has a sapphire blue drawing of a winged heart on her forehead and a hot pink drawing of a pair of angel wings with the words "simply angelic" written above them on her ears. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a bright energy field.
She has a tattoo of a female angel with her white feathered wings spread out in flight on her right shoulder, a tattoo of a male angel with his midnight black feathered wings spread in an arc on her left shoulder, a tattoo of a red heart on her left thigh, a tattoo of a pink heart with a blood-tipped arrow going through it on her right thigh, a tattoo of an angel with rays of light emanating from it on her upper back, a tattoo of a gold phoenix being born out of flames on her lower back, and a tattoo of a sapphire blue spaceship on her torso.
She has a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her left earlobe and a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with sparkly snow white eyeshadow. She is wearing sparkly snow white lip dye on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted pale gold with cream and silver angel wings and adorned with small beads of lapis and the nails on her right hand are painted pale gold with cream and silver angel wings and adorned with small beads of lapis.
For a top, she is wearing a draping black and gold gauzy tube top with color-changing zigzags printed on it over a sheer black and gold flex metal soft cup bra with delicate chain work framing the cups. For a bottom, she is wearing a short clingy black and gold lace pencil skirt which appears to be made out of rippling water over a soft black and gold lace thong with tiny glittering rhinestones all over it. She is wearing an eye-catching sapphire blue rose gold belly chain adorned with tiny dangling white glass lilies around her waist. She is also wearing a high-capacity sparkly Lore computer, a spacious cerulean blue rabbit fur diaper bag with a dangling silver angel charm on the zipper, a small well-crafted harp hanging from a golden chain, a moonstone studded gold digital wristwatch with an angel-shaped liquid crystal face, a sky blue reinforced alligator skin leather tote bag with a heraldic cross design stamped on the front and a clasp shaped like a crown, a yellow b
23:50 eaded velvet garment bag with priceless gems lining the openings, an antique white gold engagement ring set with a radiant bloodstone, an intricately braided white gold chain with an elegant baby-shaped platinum locket encrusted with sapphires suspended from it, a gold suede purse with beaded black roses on it, a dainty tri-colored gold friendship ring featuring a princess-cut red 4 karat star ruby accented by white diamonds, a gold padded fleece cradle sling, a delicate white gold diamond-studded wedding ring, and a blue velvet artifact storage container.
She is carrying a mug of French Vanilla hot coco with whipped cream in her left hand and a glossy red rosewood bowl containing banana pudding blended with crushed chocolate cookies in her right hand.

23:50 Moiraine Yobi giggles quietly.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, and a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
