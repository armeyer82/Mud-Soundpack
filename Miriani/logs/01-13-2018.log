["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that th
00:00 e ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.
Players: Alexander West and Brianna West
It is currently Alexander West's turn.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.
Players: Alexander West and Brianna West

13:02 ["Passionate Blaze" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

16:32 Brianna West
She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This slender woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 8 inches tall with an ample bust size. Her heart-shaped face bears a light golden tan complexion. Her silky waist-length, honey blonde hair is in an ornate french twist clipped with a dolphin-shaped platinum clip adorned with imperial blue topaz and yellow canary diamonds. She has expressive celestial blue eyes with an elegant button nose above a set of full, pouty lips which part to reveal sparkling white, perfectly straight teeth. Her abdomen is very large and rounded, appearing to have shifted lower on her frame. She has a purple stamp of a kitty cat on her right hand. She has a sapphire blue drawing of a winged heart on her forehead and a hot pink drawing of a pair of angel wings with the words "simply angelic" written above them on her ears. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a bright energy field.
She has a tattoo of a female angel with her white feathered wings spread out in flight on her right shoulder, a tattoo of a male angel with his midnight black feathered wings spread in an arc on her left shoulder, a tattoo of a red heart on her left thigh, a tattoo of a pink heart with a blood-tipped arrow going through it on her right thigh, a tattoo of an angel with rays of light emanating from it on her upper back, a tattoo of a gold phoenix being born out of flames on her lower back, and a tattoo of a sapphire blue spaceship on her torso.
She has a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her left earlobe and a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with sparkly snow white eyeshadow. She is wearing sparkly snow white lip dye on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted creamy white with thorny black roses and adorned with silver crystal feathers and the nails on her right hand are painted creamy white with thorny black roses and adorned with silver crystal feathers.
She is wearing a sexy misty blue halter satin backless dress with a train of cascading beadwork.  She is wearing a pair of elegant powdery blue silk pumps with icy silver bladed heels on her feet. She is wearing an eye-catching sapphire blue rose gold belly chain adorned with tiny dangling white glass lilies around her waist. She is also wearing a high-capacity sparkly Lore computer, a spacious cerulean blue rabbit fur diaper bag with a dangling silver angel charm on the zipper, a small well-crafted harp hanging from a golden chain, a moonstone studded gold digital wristwatch with an angel-shaped liquid crystal face, a sky blue reinforced alligator skin leather tote bag with a heraldic cross design stamped on the front and a clasp shaped like a crown, a yellow beaded velvet garment bag with priceless gems lining the open
16:32 ings, an antique white gold engagement ring set with a radiant bloodstone, an intricately braided white gold chain with an elegant baby-shaped platinum locket encrusted with sapphires suspended from it, a gold suede purse with beaded black roses on it, a dainty tri-colored gold friendship ring featuring a princess-cut red 4 karat star ruby accented by white diamonds, a gold padded fleece cradle sling, a delicate white gold diamond-studded wedding ring, a blue velvet artifact storage container, a black spacesuit jet, a black spacesuit navigational computer, and a bone white leather backpack with black and silver skulls hanging from the zippers.
She is carrying a small paper plate containing a Macadamia Nut with Dark Chocolate Chips cookie in her left hand.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret tucked into a corner, an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats resting against the back wall, an antique white animal fur futon with a rustic animal print blanket draped across the back resting against the left wall, an antique white mahogany tea table surrounded by elegant golden thrones in the center of the room, a gold trash bin tucked into a corner, a furry white Bear skin area rug in front of a massive marble fireplace with a mahogany hearth and a mosaic tile mantel, a tall white marble entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen nex to an antique white mahogany tea table surrounded by elegant golden thrones, a massive marble fireplace with a mahogany hearth and a mosaic tile mantel looming at the front of the room, a mahogany coffee table in the corner between an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats and an antique white animal fur futon with a rustic animal print blanket draped across the back with a delicate crystal vase holding lilies mixed with orchids and daffodils tied at the stems with white satin ribbon sitting on top of it, three glossy blue security drones, a shiny gold starship simulator, a low blue marble garden fountain with water streaming from the hands of an angel kneeling in its basin bubbling quietly against the right wall, a gold comfortable padded baby bouncer seat with an overhead toy bar that has several stuffed superheroes hanging down, a small mahogany bassinet lined with amethyst purple soft padding and covered with a midnight blue canopy, a gleaming blue medical drone, a red plastic wagon, an enormous cream lion skin area rug, a yellow metal wagon, a sleek sapphire blue metal horse carriage with pale pink wheels, a compact warm gold baby carriage which plays music as it moves, a hologram of a flickering campfire projected in the middle of the room, a roomy light blue dog house, a glossy fire agate sphere, a sparkly gold vanity table with a lighted angel-shaped mirror, a portable jet black vanity table with an attached plush sapphire blue chair and a lighted dolphin-shaped mirror, a sky blue portable salon, a beautiful blonde-haired nanny, a handsome waiter wearing a white tuxedo, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, Calina West, Leah West, a compact camouflaged cooler with zip up compartments along the sides, Kara West, Harmony West, a hologram of a beach sunset projected on one wall, Julie Casey, a jet black box with a glowing snowflake on top, a deck of Assault cards trimmed in gold, a white Amalthean wolfhound, Lucy Kasey, an arctic wolf, and Melody West here.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
