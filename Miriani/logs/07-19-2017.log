14:37 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Rename
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

Command: Biolock
Applies: In rooms with biometric doors in them
Syntax: biolock
Allows you to add or remove biometric identities from the door you're standing next too.

Command: Flight
Applies: Space station security center
Syntax: flight
Allows you to configure flight control settings.

Command: Authorize
Applies: Space station security center.
Syntax: authorize
Allows you to add and remove caretakers and owners.

Command: Camera
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: camera
Allows you to add or remove security cameras, which are visible from the security center.

Command: Tur
Applies: Station security center.
Syntax: tur [on | off]
Allows you to enable or disable the security cameras. It is worth noting that you cann
14:41 ot specify a location as an argument like you can in a starship, and they have no turrets attached to them, so selecting one from the list that appears if you type tur with no arguments will merely enable or disable the cameras.

Command: Boot
Applies: Security center or garage.
Syntax: boot [person]
Allows you to boot a specific person. If you're on a space station, they will be booted to the docking bay. A colony planet or moon would boot to the landing pad. A house would boot to the entrance to the property.

Command: PA
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: pa [toggle | message]
The toggle argument will allow you to enable or disable the PA system. If you use a message, your message will be transmitted to everybody on the station or in the house.

Command: Status
Applies: Security center.
Syntax: status
Shows you how many rooms you have built.

Command: Menu
Applies: Garage
Syntax: menu
Allows you to authorize and deauthorize people from the garage as well as adding and removing owners.

Command: @Shop
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @shop
Allows you to set the current room up as a shop. When you execute the command you will be given the opportunity to create a menu and then send it to the hosts for approval.

Command: Starmap (SM)
Applies: Observation room.
Syntax: SM (see HELP STARMAP)
Shows a starmap of the surrounding space.

Command: Public
Applies: House rooms
Syntax: public
Toggles public access to the house.

Command: Groups
Applies: House rooms, security centers
Syntax: groups
Configures access groups, which are lists of members that have access to certain privileges.

Command: Doorreset
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorreset
Resets the password on a locked door if you're an owner of the property.

Command: @outside
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: @outside
Tells you if the room is an indoor or outdoor room.

14:51 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room.

14:53 The computer announces, "Precision wormhole drive is powering up. Calculating optimal path for precision entry..."

14:53 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

14:53 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:53 The ten-person battlecruiser "Subtle Resilience" has jumped into the sector.

14:53 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

14:53 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

14:53 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:53 Miriam Valleris spends a moment examining the starmap.

14:54 Miriam Valleris inputs some coordinates into a navigational control console.

14:54 You notice Miriam Valleris beginning the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:54 This ship transmits greetings.

14:54 The one-person cargo hauler "Risk" has launched from Acrylon.

14:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

18:52 ["Tyranny's End" Weapons Room 12] (sitting on the floor)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

21:33 ["Tyranny's End" Weapons Room 12] (lying on the floor)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

23:22 A crisp sheet of ivory legal document with a time stamp in one corner

23:22 

July 19 2363
To whom it may concern,
On behalf of the crew who accompanied Highguard Captain Evelin Kantrelle during the past days into Praelor space on the mission to allow Highguard to find the Kritzn production facility, we, members of all three alliances, petition you to reconsider the punishment of Captain Kantrelle for the actions taken on July 17th,23 63. Highguard obviously elevated Ms. Kantrelle to captain status for a reason, for her judgment and trustworthiness. When in a position such as hers, sometimes one is forced into making difficult decisions. In this case, we had been faced with overwhelming odds in Stage 6 of the operation, and had no way of knowing what may, or may not happen. The defense of Stage 1 was critical, only hindsight allows to know that it was not necessary. Captain Kantrelle left a competent pilot in charge of operations until her return from meeting with her superiors, who acted accordingly when others began to investigate the controls and capabilities of the leviathan.
Captain Kantrelle has earned our respect, trust and loyalty as a leader and individual, and we hope that these qualities do not overshadow a situation that could have been handled differently, but was ultimately dealt with, with the best of intentions, and instinctive swiftness.
Signed: Pilots of the Alliances
