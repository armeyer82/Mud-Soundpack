Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and
both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather sofa, and a steel plaque engraved with the phrase

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather sofa, and a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array." here.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Providence Station; Docking Bay.

l damien
Damien Alexander
He appears to be 32 years old. He is about six feet and one inch tall and has
tan skin. His body is athletic with average-shaped hips and well-muscled calves.
He has sloping shoulders and an averagely built chest. His face is narrow and
subtly asymmetrical, with a sharp nose and strong chin. His lips are thin and
beige and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set
of dark eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and average-shaped. His short, straight
hair is dark red and mostly unkempt but standing on end down the middle in a
faux hawk. He also has dark red stubble. He has several white-tipped brown hawk
feathers hanging from a length of braided brown leather in his hair.
A small enameled crimson fist pierces his left earlobe, a thick stainless steel
ring with a dolphin charm pierces his right eyebrow, a small enameled mystic
purple skull pierces his right earlobe, a small enameled emerald dragonfly
pierces his left upper ear, an old titanium ring engraved with a row of tiny
chainguns pierces his left eyebrow, and a small diamond stud with a matching
starship charm pierces his right upper ear.
 He is wearing a buckled black leather choker with a double row of steel pyramid
studs, a long-sleeved navy blue fatigue shirt with a Fringe shoulder patch, a
pair of chunky indigo fingerless gloves decorated with criss-crossing leather
bands covered with square brass studs, a pair of loose-fitting navy blue fatigue
pants, and a pair of black synthleather engineer boots with criss-crossing
adjustable straps. He is also wearing a wrist-mounted chronometer, an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around his wrist, an indigo slider einrophone in a
black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a
gunmetal gray canvas messenger bag. His head, face, both eyes, and both wrists
are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a short-sleeved aqua sailor top with a soft white bow, a pair of
skinny white low rise jeans, and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is
also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a
slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named
Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows,
both forearms, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise
Vineyards Pinot Grigio in her right hand, and a slice of sausage and roasted
pepper pizza in her left hand.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and
both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying a plush periwinkle bath towel trimmed with eyelet lace in her
right hand.

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
