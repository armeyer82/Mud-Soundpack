Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Supernova"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.
You see an overstuffed black chair, a transparisteel storage case, and an
improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Eve thought it was past
time somebody fetched him an' nobody else seemed willin' ta actually go an' do
it. I didn't want ta see her get hurt so I went along. Why didn't one o'your
guys get him?"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Because we don't want him."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We told you guys why.
Nicolette was waiting for word from the government in regards to if they are
going to arrest him or if we need to set him free."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, if people get on their
case, I get on those people's case, particularly if it's the people who put him
there and who are now out on a trip for a week."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What he did is wrong, I would
have insisted he'd give up his felo."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Um they did."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Apparently they tried that.
He hit Akemi and was going nuts. He had to be detained. Though I will say it
should not have taken half a dozen people to do it."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Glad ta hear that, Kim. If
League really wanted the other alliances ta stay out of it, they shoulda said
so. Now, I can't speak fer Eve, but it it's yer cadet it's really yer problem,
ta speak straight."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If we had let him stay there,
we at least should have taken care of food, drink, and checked that he was ok
medically. Even in prison you have basic rights."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I agree."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "He was busted all the fuck
up when we picked him up."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If it's our cadet and our
problem, you should have stayed the fuck out of it to begin with."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "You'll have ta take that up
with Eve."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "I saw him personally just
yesterday. That isn't busted up. He was well bruised at best."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Ok we forgot to call Hairy."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's now your problem, you
rescued him."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh my what did I wake
up to?"
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Indeed, you guys wanted him so
take him. Let him live on Chetumal."
tra 1 chuckle 'Hi Lily.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles. "Hi Lily."
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "A majority of us don't want
him at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi I think I need to
mute the general channel and put the pillow over my head!"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Anyway, I did speak to him
from the safety of my ship before they picked him up. He said he wanted to
appologize and stuff. Which, apparently he did write letters. So, hopefully this
mess is over."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hopefully."
tra 1 chuckle
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Be glad ta be done with
it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh well!"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "However, there are people
who did all this and ran off. I am not very happy. They should clean up their
own shit."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah, yeah, they should.
The fuck is up with that anyhow?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I dunno."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Don't you know you can't
interrupt the schedule of an expedition for anything?"
[General Communication] Damien Goss chuckles.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Don't get me wrong, that
someone who causes serious trouble needs to be dealt with, is not a problem. And
making someone stay on a temp station for a while is, I guess not the worst
possible idea. But how long and under what conditions is the questions."
[General Communication] Michael Winters transmits, "That wasn't a planned
expedition though."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "That wasn't scheduled. They
ran off in the middle of the night, no plannin', just up an' went."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Akemi invited me and basicly
said, anfisa actually wants to leave now."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Wherever they all are, it
looks bad on them not showing up."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "They went to see some spawning
ground, where Bari and other creatures come from, or so Akemi told me."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Actually it makes it look like
they are running away."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Was Anfisa in on the thing,
the 'beat Harvey up an' stick him on a temp station' thing? I was out like a
light at the time all this shit happened."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "It does."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Surely that could have waited a
day or 2."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Thing is, before Akemi
left, she spouted off, if anybody frees him they deal with me and then runs
off."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Fuck that."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander growls. "Fuck that is right."
[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "What are we talking about?
The harvey thing? Sorry just turned on this channel."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah, Nathaniel."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I dunno who all was
involved. I've only seen Kringle since it happened. He didn't run."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Ok so subject change but i'm
almost home and want to know if the station is needed urgently."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Shit like this makes me
hate the pilotin' corps."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "She called me yesterday
morning, Kim, there's this guy on Orion, don't let him out, his name is Harvey,
he spread felo and was agressive. Oh and by the way would you like to come on a
spontanious expedition, Anfisa wants to.... and the rest I already told you."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Right."

[Starship "Supernova"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a short-sleeved white cotton top trimmed with tiny embroidered
flowers, a pair of tight light blue denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX'
embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a
neon pink vibro-baton, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Farport; Docking Bay]
The containing walls of this large but battered docking bay define an octagonal
space perhaps one hundred meters in diameter situated on the top of the station,
with massive bay doors on the east and west sides. Areas of the deck are marked
off with grubby orange duct tape as berths for docked starships. Two freight
elevators are built into the bay, one located behind the smaller starships
docked on the north side, and another on the southwest side, shiny and new and
providing a startling contrast to the aged character of the rest of the bay. The
bay itself is rather poorly lit, the overall dim grayness dotted by the bright
work lanterns of mechanics and technicians working on docked starships. In the
center of the bay is a scarred steel bunker with a sign over its wide hatch
reading: 'Station Access.'

of the room. Upon it is a clear oval-shaped shell, which contains an alien plant
with yellow veins.
This is a faintly pulsing stalk with thick yellow veins. The plant's primary
color is silver with a sheen of deep purple, faintly reflective, reminiscent of
metal.
The plant is somewhat large, though still not fully grown.

A large cradle slides up from beneath and stops, displaying itself in the center
of the room. Upon it is a clear oval-shaped shell, which contains an alien plant
with purple warts.
This is a thick spiraling stalk with thick purple warts. The plant's primary
color is silver with a sheen of deep purple, faintly reflective, reminiscent of
metal.
Though not near fully grown, the plant looks to have established itself.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large

of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers" and Shule
Elemmire's workbench here.

sapphire star quilt on it.
[General Communication] Harvey Fredricks transmits, "So whether a robot is
controlled through a tower or not is what determines if it's a robot or a drone?
That's a pretty loose difference."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I imagine that the drones are
merely acting on their last preprogrammed commands."
[General Communication] Kirk Waltham transmits, "I presume they have some
limited self preservation code in the event they're disconnected."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Probably doesn't last too
long."

confusion in a breakfast restaurant?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na. You usually can only get
one robot to follow yo uat any given time."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Unless you're commanding
hoverbots. You can have two hoverbots following you at all times."

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Go well, mighty spacebus."
[General Communication] Kirk Waltham transmits, "No law against two women making
out."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, that's the league for
you. More willing to display public signs of effection. Not my style, but there
we are."

Chetumal's lounge."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Best thing ever."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Show offs."
[General Communication] Harvey Fredricks transmits, "Not saying anything wrong
with the two women part, I'm saying I think they will end up causing some type
of physical damage or chafing. I'm worried about their health."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Wait a minute."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander laughs.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Nothing wrong with a bit of
arm-wrestling."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Nothing wrong with a bit of
kissing."

about?"
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a
red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
[General Communication] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Someone said he saw two women
smooching in one of the pilots lounges, personally I think he's just perving at
them."

something."
[General Communication] Marco Giovani transmits, "Ah, let them have their fun."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I am pretty sure it's not
the same 2."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Well, if you are assuming
it's always the same two women in there, um, get some glasses. I'd say it
probably is not."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Caleb, out of my head."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels giggles.
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport laughs.
[General Communication] Marco Giovani transmits, "People find creative ways to
enjoy their down time."

corner than."

[General Communication] Harvey Fredricks transmits, "I bet the Sanitation bot
spends hours every day cleaning that booth."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Um, sure."
[General Communication] Michael Winters yawns.
[General Communication] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Cleaning what? Cooties? Not
like kissing leaves a residue on the furniture."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Well, when you make out,
sometimes, um, that'll do."
[General Communication] Harvey Fredricks transmits, "I didn't say they were
kissing, I said they were making out, that's much more involved then kissing,
are you twelve?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport chuckles.
[General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Erm, wow?"
[General Communication] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Bear in mind some parts of the
galaxy have differences in dialect before you assume people are 12."
[General Communication] Harvey Fredricks transmits, "Understandable, well, in my
dialect, that doesn't mean kissing. Where are you from?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Explain what it means."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels giggles.
[General Communication] Kirk Waltham transmits, "I have an imagination thankyou,
once it was pointed out that it was more than kissing that's plenty of
information. Unless someone wants to give m,e a practical demonstration..."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels whistles.
[General Communication] Angel Martin laughs.
[General Communication] Harvey Fredricks transmits, "It means one or all of the
above. Fondling, Groping, Rubbing, Fingering, Dry Humping and many others."
[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Fuck that."
[General Communication] Kirk Waltham transmits, "Nathaniel, is that an offer?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Wait now, when you get into
some of that stuff that you named, with two females, that's getting into the
actual sex stuff."
[General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "That is not an offer. Go
fuck someone else, like cesar or something."
[General Communication] Harvey Fredricks transmits, "It's a razor's edge between
making out and sex after all."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.
[General Communication] Kirk Waltham transmits, "I'd have called some of that
foreplay."

Star Conquest Help: Trade Cycles the Card Game
--
Two rival Spinward Clans, a group of unregistered pilots known for their trade
acuity, have completed one half of a trade cycle, landing in Mutuality space.
Which side will come home with a full hold and gain all of the honour and
prestige, and which side will drift endlessly through empty space?
Trade Cycles is played with a deck of cards, each card representing an event of
some kind, from your opponent running out of fuel, or you finding an extra
battery in your flagship's trade goods. Each card has one of three properties:
Problem, Solution, or Safeguard.
In order to place any lightyear cards you must be Enroute or fly with the Way of
the Clans. Additionally, you may run into trouble along the way. Pirate attacks
will neccessitate repairs, running out of charge will require a charge booster,
if your artificial gravity systems fail you may need to jury rig a solution, the
flagship may need to be escorted by a wing of fighters through an asteroid
field, or the flagship might be held up at a quantum skim accelerator. Of
course, pirates are no match to a flight ace, an extra battery will keep the
flagship charged enough to make the trip, high-tech alliance goodies won't fail 
and need cobbled-together parts, and you won't need to worry about asteroid
fields or skim queues if you fly with your innate clanner abilities.
The first player to go exactly four hundred (400) lightyears wins. Having
safeguards in play increase your score, with an additional bonus for having all
four safeguards. Another bonus is given out for not playing any eighty lightyear
cards.
Commands:
TRADECYCLES to start a game.
JOIN for an opponent to join the game.
DRAW to draw a card; used each round.
STOP to end a game early.

As you look at the engine speeds, note that the AEU actually gets a bonus to
their engine's overall speed. The speed you see written in the statistics above
is the speed that the engine can reach for all of the other alliances that have
access to it, as well as any ships we might buy from corporations. The bonus is
not included until it is installed on an AEU starship that is eligible for it.
Pilots should also note that instant speeds will vary depending on the size of a
ship, even if you have a battery which can manage the engine's instant speed.
You will likely come to see that larger ships will move slower, whereas smaller
ships will move faster.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a

You see a light cruiser here.
"Starlight Express" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "H-03" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a white color with gunmetal grey trim. Its
laser turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in gunmetal grey. Its
landing struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
The four-person star liner "Starlight Express" is loaded onto an automated

When choosing a combat grid, you need to look for two things. The first is the
grid's capacity. You want it to be as high as you can get it. The second is a
good recharge time. It won't do if you have a combat grid with a high capacity
that takes ages to finally recharge. You'll be able to get more shots off in the
beginning of a fight, but the grid will still recharge slower and could leave
you vulnerable, especially if you're fighting multiple ships.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole

of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

ftl muttering deeps
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
w`G6k6-6?;$;oIkGw]-C{Im<^fq|9Y)(]UlE?6JG
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

A large cradle slides up from beneath and stops, displaying itself in the center
of the room. Upon it is a clear oval-shaped shell, which contains an alien plant
with yellow veins.
This is a faintly pulsing stalk with thick yellow veins. The plant's primary
color is silver with a sheen of deep purple, faintly reflective, reminiscent of
metal.
The plant is somewhat large, though still not fully grown.

GSL won't be an issue! That's one of the reasons I voted for Kim."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

that matter and that is where I wanted to concentrate my energies but alas, It
will never happen now."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I felt that I needed to be in office for
a few terms though to work on that or to at least begin as it is not going to
heppen overnight given what damage is done."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Happen that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Stop wasting your
time with the Mutuality. Their council clearly does not want a non-aggression
pact with us. If they did, then they'd be willing to work with us regarding the
incident which caused them to break relations. Short of turning the slaver
prisoners over to them which I highly doubt they would even give a shit about
anymore, there is literally nothing we can do right now which would make them
want to reestablish relations unless you've magically figured out where Kendra's
located."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The first term they would have laughed
at us given what tatiana did ans last term peobably just as much so I thought
third term I could begin laying some ground work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And to be honest, I
wouldn't want to turn the slavers to them anyway. They were tried and convicted
by the AEU government, and are now serving their punishment such as it is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "I remember that."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That is true but there
are other aspects where we can certainly improve upon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, again, if
you've magically figured out a way where our pilots wouldn't turn into a bunch
of nutcases or pirate supporters, I'm sure that the people screening them would
love to hear from you."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches south.
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I don't think we even
have any influence nowadays over the slavers situation. They've already served
what over two years now?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's irrelevant in
either case."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "True."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I wouldn't turn them
over even if they asked, and more than likely, the government would not turn
over AEU citizens either."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "But I believe that we
were headed towards at least something reasonable bfore Gray, then Nils and
Takana and Tatiana."
A medium-sized semi-transparent cylindrical creature with long dangling tendrils
and a chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, I'm not
saying that reestablishing a non-aggression pact with the Mutuality is a bad
idea, I'm just saying that we should not bend over backwards for them when
clearly they don't seem to be giving much of a shit about it themselves."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good point."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Still I believe we have
damage control to do with all alliances frankly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Why do we have damage
control to handle with the other alliances?"
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'm not saying that
League under the influence of one Emily Ford is being reasonable but we don't
deserve to be shunned as much as they are shunning us lately."
[Notification from Starseekers] 1 megacredit has been spent on the
organization's hyperwave relay rental contract.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Takana is probably in
a psych ward, Tatiana retired, the slavers are in jail, Nils is really the only
loose piece on the board."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Mainly that they all
think we're a bunch of fuck ups."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then just prove them
wrong. Again, don't bend over backwards for them."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "They love to make
sarcastic remarks about being 'Exceptional'."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like I said, prove
them wrong. Perhaps the banning of other pilots form the alliance save for
special exceptions is a good thing. It will allow us, for now, to rebuild with
more capable pilots before we let the nutjobs trickle back in."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah that is how I've
always regarded and let the nut jobs go to them."
Lily Kaise keys her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It seems lately, that
their own academys aren't recruiting anything more exceptional or who possess
the best mentality. They also so easily forget Dennis Feldman and now this
latest one."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh yeah and Damien Goss is another one."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm just waiting..."
'Who's this Dennis guy?
You ask, "Who's this Dennis guy?"
'er, who was he?
You ask, "Er, who was he?"
[General Communication] Klaus Stein transmits, "Are the bubble beacons fixed and
working?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Maybe, but possibly not.
Sometimes I get sucked out and others not."
[General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Yes, but lower your trim to 25
before you take off out of orion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which just goes to
show the kind of mentality that even the Mutuality council has. We were able to
round up and imprison our slaver pilots quickly and decisively. The League have
had at the very least around the same amount of time to find Dennis but have not
done so, and the Mutuality council hasn't threatened them, broken off relations,
etc despite the fact that he was the figurehead for the entire trade as clearly
evidenced by the film. Granted, our people didn't stop him, but he didn't
exactly stop himself, either. No, the Mutuality council just wanted an excuse
and pounced on it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which goes back again
to why should we have to bend over backwards to please the other alliances."
[General Communication] Klaus Stein transmits, "Right."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah that is what I
perceived from the coverage I saw after I became a pilot."
'Who was this Dennis Fledman guy?
You ask, "Who was this Dennis Fledman guy?"
'er, Feldman
You say, "Er, Feldman."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Uh."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "He was the slaver from League who was so
intimmidating and who was the one who called out the actual slade trades and who
taunted and who traded the league starship."
'Oy, sounds like a real winner.
You say, "Oy, sounds like a real winner."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "He ran and was never caught so the AEU
women took the fall."
'ouch
You say, "Ouch."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not that what they did was right but
they took the fall."

[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Six."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm not into physical punishment but
when it comes to ths Slavers, I almost go over the line there. I could never
condone slavery of any sort and so although I know that the lack of experience
amongst a couple of very new pilots who were there and the element of shock and
surprise were likely in play. Still, what occurred was haneous and cruel to
other humans and they don't deserve, in my humble opinion, they mercy."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a

olive skin. His body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. He has
average-sized shoulders and a wide chest. His face is average-shaped and
handsome, with a broad nose and strong chin. His lips are thin and tan and
occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of arched
eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and round. His chin-length, straight hair is
blonde and neatly trimmed over the ears and parted on the side. He has large
brownish fingernails.
 He is wearing a short-sleeved oceanside blue linen shirt, a pair of slim Sahara
sand linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. He is also wearing a

Subject: Seeking a beacon autostop for my Gemini
Author: Corey Matthews
Posted: 04:18 25 June 2316 GST

Hello fellow pilots,
I would like to obtain a beacon autostop for my gemini for use in artifacting. I
don't know how much they would normally run but I am willing to pay for someone
to craft this for me. If any one is able or willing to do this, please contact
me via mail or here on this board. I sometimes have the general comm channel
turned off, so I may not answer if you try to contact me there.
Thank you very much in advance.

Star Conquest Help: Organizations
--
Category: Game Systems
--
An organization allows a group of pilots to organize in a semi-official manner.
Pilots in an organization can:
 * Share funds for the purposes of buying organization-owned starships.
 * Contribute to a group insurance fund to cover the destruction of
organization-owned starships.
 * Have their own communicator channel.
 * Cooperatively operate temporary space stations.
 * Support large starships.
TYPES OF MEMBERS
 * Founder: There is only one founder. This is the person who created the
organization. One must have 1000 aggregate points in order to found an
organization.
 * Acting Founder: If the organization's founder plans on taking a leave of
absence, they can appoint somebody to temporarily stand in as founder of the
organization. Alternately, if the founder (or current acting founder, for that
matter) is inactive for an extended period, a trustee may request the
appointment of a new acting founder. Until the acting founder steps down or the
founder unilaterally revokes their access, they will be treated as the founder
in every way, and the actual founder's vote will be similar to a trustee's.
 * Trustees: These are people with a higher level of trust, with the ability to
propose and vote on organization actions, and buy starships and station modules
on behalf of the organization.
 * Members: Regular members can contribute to the organization and use
organization-owned ships.
REQUIREMENTS
The organization, just like an individual pilot, will gradually build up
industry, combat, and other types of points as its members work. In order to buy
a ship or a station module, not only must the trustee meet its requirements, but
the organization must as well.
Members can decide which percentage of their points they are contributing, from
0% to a maximum determined by the size of the organization, most often 10-20%.
UNITY
Organizations are free to take in any member they like belonging to any
alliance. However, once more than one alliance is involved in an organization,
unity is taken into account.
Unity affects both the rate at which an organization earns points, and the total
amount of points it has. Organizations with low unity (for instance, when its
members are at war) are very ineffective.
The more alliances you bring into your organization, the more unity will affect
it. Extremely large organizations will also suffer from disorganization, which
increases unity penalties. The most effective organization will be one
consisting of a few like-minded characters who have banded together for good,
well-roleplayed reasons.
MANAGING AN ORGANIZATION
Organization rooms are present in every capital spaceport. You can manage your
organization with the MENU command, or view its information with the INFO
command.
JOINING AN ORGANIZATION
Organizations may choose to list themselves publicly and offer open recruitment.
You may go to your capital's organization room and apply to any organization
that has done this.
Organizations are also encouraged to use the in-game message board and other IC
means to recruit new members. Recruitment and other organization business should
NEVER occur outside of the game.
ACTIONS
Trustees can initiate and vote on certain actions that affect the organization
as a whole. The action will pass as soon as the "for" votes create a majority,
or fail as soon as an "against" vote makes a majority impossible.
The founder, however, can act as a dictator. Actions initiated by the founder
will be immediately approved. Additionally, the founder's vote will instantly
pass or veto a pending action.
ORGANIZATION POINTS
Organizations gain points much as pilots do. They do this when members that have
chosen to contribute points perform point-gaining activities.
To contribute points to your organization, visit your capital's organization
room and choose the Change Point Contribution Level option. Depending on the
size of your organization, you may set your contribution level to 5%, 10%, 20%,
or even up to 100%. This is the percentage of points that you will "lose" to
your organization. In other words, if your contribution level is 20% and you
gain 10 points from a load of salvage, you will keep 8 points while 2 points go
to your organization.
When an organization has 1000 industry points and 500 space combat points, it
can begin earning command points by contributing certain modules (salvage
processors, salvage op controllers, battle analysis scanners, and certain
others) to temporary space stations. Command points open up unique opportunities
for an organization to assist its alliance, generally with better station
modules.
ORGANIZATION FACILITIES
Each capital spaceport contains a pilot liaison office, and within this office
is an entire level devoted to organizations. This level has its own organization
management center as well as more specific facilities for both business and
pleasure. Organizations can choose to purchase access to these facilities.
STARSHIP SUPPORT
As you may be aware, an alliance sometimes limits the total number of starships
of certain models, particularly gunship- and cruiser-class ships. This is
because an alliance's funding is limited, and starships incur a constant cost in
energy, replacement parts, and routine maintenance performed by spaceport
technicians. Thus, for example, you may wish to buy a cruiser, but find that
your alliance is unwilling to construct and support any more.
However, this can be solved if your organization chooses to take up these costs
instead. Organizations can take over the costs of supporting starships, and
thereby, they can allow starships to be operated beyond the alliance's limit.
Every Conquest period, each starship's support cost will be deducted from the
organization's support fund. If the organization cannot cover its support costs,
flight control will deny launch clearance for the affected ships.
Note that, as of this writing, it is not of any benefit to support ships which
are produced in unlimited numbers. Also, it's important to note that this
affects only the maximum number of available starships, not the rate at which
they are constructed.
VASSALIZATION
Organizations with at least 2000 command points can become "thanes" of less
advanced organizations. "Thane" is an archaic word for one who is able to levy
resources from his or her vassals, but is otherwise not much elevated above
them. Vassalization should not be considered a punitive relationship or a
leadership hierarchy, but rather simply a way to more efficiently distribute
resources.
An organization can offer vassalization to a more advanced organization of the
same alliance, offering to pay 25%, 50%, or 75% of all station part costs in the
form of megacredits. In return, the vassal organization will be counted as a
full contributor on all stations that the thane organization is involved in.
This allows, for example, for a new or less advanced organization to pay for
half of the cost of an expensive salvage op controller module that it cannot buy
on its own, and then be counted as a full and equal contributor towards the
finished station.
In order for a vassal to pay anything, its percentage must work out to be a
whole number. For instance, 25% of a 1-megacredit station core is not a whole
number, and the vassal would not be able to pay anything.
Vassals gain by receiving credit for station activities, and thanes gain by
reducing their own, often much greater costs. This also allows for more
organizations to be involved in a single station. It will also allow
organizations of the same alliance to essentially ally with each other and work
together more closely.
Vassals must designate a certain number of megacredits to be usable by their
thane. Their thane cannot spend more than this amount. Vassals also have full
control over the relationship with the option to unilaterally withdraw
vassalization at any time.
Thanes have a togglable option to use vassal megacredits at all. If a thane
organization wishes to be the sole contributor to a station, it can toggle the
option off. While the option is on, all vassals will contribute their portion of
the station part cost. In the event that there are enough vassals contributing
enough to completely pay for the part, the thane organization will pay nothing.
If there are enough vassals to exceed the part's total cost, the highest
contributing vassals will be prioritized. Thanes can unilaterally remove vassals
at any time.
It is up to the organizations and their members to decide under which
circumstances they might offer, accept, and withdraw vassalization. Again, on
the face of it, the relationship is nothing more than a system of resource
distribution that acknowledges the thane organization's greater access to
advanced station parts and the past effort that was required to gain it.
ORGANIZATION REGULATIONS
Organizations may make whichever rules or regulations they like in regards to
who they accept as members, required contribution levels, whose starships they
will support, and so on. The game's staff will generally not help you enforce
these individual regulations; however, the organization may enforce them itself
in any manner which does not run afoul of the game's policies.
Strange, extreme, or unusual organization rules or actions may have in-character
consequences, as with anything else in the game.
ORGANIZATIONS AND ROLEPLAYING
Organizations are a good way to bring varied groups of people together and have
them engage in either conflict or friendship beyond the usual alliance lines.
Organizations should be a way to meet new people and experience the world with
friends and like-minded characters. Organization-wide endeavors make excellent
fodder for unique events organized by the game's staff.
An organization should strive to avoid becoming insular and isolated from the
rest of the game, and they should not be used as a shortcut to bring out-of-game
relationships into the roleplaying environment. An organization provides you
with another identity for your character and another way in which you can affect
the game world; it should not become a bubble which insulates you from everyone
else's roleplaying.
Additionally, a player should never be cajoled to join or abandon an
organization via out-of-game communications, nor should organization actions be
planned outside of the game. That sort of thing always does massive damage to
the game's roleplaying environment, and it will not be tolerated.
POLICY STATEMENT
Organizations make it easier to get around alliance and point requirements for
starships in a way that is difficult to enforce automatically. That much is
obvious. So in place of that, we'll explicitly state our intentions for how the
system is meant to be used. Working against these intentions in order to avoid
alliance/point requirements WILL be a violation of the Workarounds policy
(Policy 6).
 * Organizations are intended to consist of people who are friends or who at
least wish to actively cooperate. Organizations should not exist purely as
business transactions or as some sort of starship exchange. Additionally, nobody
should ever be paid to found, join, or leave an organization.
 * Members of an organization are expected to remain members on a semi-permanent
basis. Members should not be joining and leaving an organization very quickly,
and especially not joining multiple organizations within a short period of time.
 * Trustees are expected to remain trustees on a semi-permanent basis. Trustees
WILL NOT be promoted just long enough to buy a ship, and then demoted. Other
players WILL NOT be paid or otherwise cajoled to join an organization and become
a trustee just long enough to buy a new ship for it.
 * Again, organizations should never plan or recruit outside of the game. This
is covered in greater detail under Policy 9: Metagaming.
