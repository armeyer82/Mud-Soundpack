Two other rooms lead off this one, to the east and south, and the children are free to wander between rooms with nannies always supervising and attending to the children. Children's artwork covers the walls, and the floor is covered in plush rugs. Shelves line the walls full of children's activities and books. Tiny colored lights are strung up around the room providing light to the room.

["Fascination" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a gleaming red secur

Atmospheric Salvaging
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Atmospheric salvaging is quite similar to regular salvaging, except that you are salvaging atmospheric components instead of debris. Atmospheric salvaging involves taking control of an atmospheric salvaging ship and bringing it into the atmosphere, where you will collect atmospheric components, which you will later be able to sell. There are three types of salvagers, regular atmospheric salvagers, gas giant salvagers, and aquatic salvagers. To operate a salvager, you should find an applicable planet, move within one unit of it, and launch your vehicle into the atmosphere. Be warned that if your ship is left unattended, it may be attacked at any time. Your salvager will notify you when the mothership is locked on, fired on, or switches to purple alert.
  The basics:
To start atmospheric salvaging, you'll need several things. The most important of which is a ship with a docking bay. To find out what ship classes come with docking bays, you can type INFO at a starship store to see information about each ship class. Look for one with "Yes" under the Dock column. Also be sure your ship has a cargo hold that is capable of holding cargo (for example, a Carrier cannot hold any cargo and would not be a good choice for this endeavour).
Next, you'll need to purchase a vehicle docking bay and an atmospheric or gas giant salvager. You can find these at any atmospheric salvager store. Don't be shy if you can't find one, someone on the comms should be able to help you locate one. You can also use the MAP command to see a map of whatever planet you're on.
  Salvaging - the regular way:
Now that you have everything you need to get started, you can enter your ship and LAUNCH it. Fly to a planet, any planet with an atmosphere, and maintain an orbit within one unit of the planet. Head down to your docking bay and type GO HATCH. You will now be in your vehicle docking bay, where you can ENTER the SALVAGER. Please note that only one person will fit in an atmospheric salvager. You can now LAUNCH the salvager into the planet's atmosphere.
Now, before you start salvaging, there's a few things you should know. First, you can type SM to check your map, just like a ship. This will show you a map of the current level, what level you're on and how much charge your salvager has remaining. Salvagers have a limited power supply, so you need to keep a constant eye on the power levels, otherwise you may crash and lose your salvager and anything you have salvaged.
Do you see the ":" symbols on the starmap? Those are the components that you need to salvage. You can move to them using the standard manual starship movement commands and just pass over them to collect them. The command + will bring your salvager higher. You can also use - to go lower. If you are already on the highest level, - will return you to your ship. As you move further down into the atmosphere, your chance of finding better materials increases. However, keep in mind that this will also use your power up faster, so keep a close eye on your power levels.
Once your salvager is full, return to your ship and you can TRANSFER the components like any other debris.
  Salvaging - gas giants:
Gas giants are planets which consist (almost) only of gasses and are therefore a valuable resource for salvagers. They can be found anywhere outside of the charted sectors. To salvage from a gas giant you need a different salvager than the one you would use for salvaging from a regular planet, however they can be bought from the same store.
Finding a gas giant can take a while. You can LAUNCH your starship and search yourself or ask on the comms to find out if someone already knows of a good planet. Once you found a planet, fly your starship next to it and go to your docking bay. From there you can GO through the HATCH of the vehicle bay, ENTER your SALVAGER and LAUNCH it. The principles described for atmospheric salvaging are the same for gas giant salvaging, except that the risks are higher, but so is the reward.
Generally, you will find that the vehicle's upgrades are more expensive and add less, and that you have to take more effort to get to a suitable planet. A gas giant is a dangerous place to work on, and so the vehicle required is much more complicated.
  Salvaging marine planets
Aquatic salvaging is just like gas giant salvaging in that you orbit the target planet and launch your salvager in the air. The commands are the same, and so is the risk factor. The only difference is that you need a special aquatic salvager to get the job done. There is also a requirement of 1000 pieces of atmospheric debris salvaged to purchase the salvagers. While salvaging in a marine planet, you will encounter life forms that enter your craft. These are called pufferfish, and a tops list has been added. You can check this by typing @PUFFERFISH or @TOP-PUFFERFISH. The number of pufferfish you've salvaged can also be found in INFO ACHIEVEMENTS (INFO ACH for short). Finally, your craft might encounter life forms in the water that take hostile action against a foreign being in their home. These forms will slam into your craft and go about their merry way, leaving the salvager slightly damaged. Please note that the aquatic landing upgrade is not required to do aquatic salvaging, as you don't actually land on the planet.
  Repairing gas giant and aquatic salvagers
As mentioned above gas giant and aquatic salvaging is much more dangerous than regular, atmospheric salvaging. It is therefore not unlikely that your salvager will get damaged while you are salvaging, especially if you move further away from your ship. The computer will inform you in the event of such a dangerous situation
04:03 . You can also type STATUS to check the current damage level.
If your salvager sustained damage you can use a tube of repair paste to fix the problem. These tubes can be bought from the same store that sells the salvagers. Once you bought a tube, USE it in the cockpit of your salvager to repair it. Finally, note that, like charge boosters and replacement hatch locks, you shouldn't buy massive amounts at once. If you will not have access to a salvager store for a longer period of time and fear that you will run out of repair paste, consider staying closer to your starship while salvaging. While this means you will not earn as much money it also reduces the chance that your salvager gets damaged.
  Sharing:
You can share an atmospheric salvager with a friend by authorizing them to use the vehicle. To do this, you must meet the following conditions and perform the following actions:
  1. You must be inside the vehicle's cockpit.
  2. Your friend must be standing outside of the vehicle in the vehicle bay.
  3. You then type: AUTHORIZE <person>

13:30 [Heart of Night; Docking Bay]
The dome shaped sealing overhead in this massive docking bay has doors that open and close whenever ships arrive or depart the station. The floor is covered in different colored tiles, some are blue, while others are red or white. The walls are painted metallic black, and the room is well-lit. There is a heart in the center surrounding the letter K. The hustle and bustle of people leaving and entering the bay can be heard mingled with the sounds of ships landing or launching. Exits lead off into different directions, leading visitors to the different parts of the station. Rather prominent robotic arms can be seen, transporting ships back and forth from the landing pad to the garage through an enormous sliding door.
You see a holographic gold flashing billboard, a black wooden bench, a glowing corkboard, a cylindrical orange plastic trash can with several compartments in it, and several purple balloons tied to a statue of a white angel here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, south, and down.

13:48 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at "Fascination" Docking Bay.
You see a metallic red starship simulator and an internal stun turret here.
You can go down and out.

13:48 You peer out and see...

13:48 ["Fascination" Docking Bay]
You're in a docking bay! You see a small hatch leading to a vehicle bay here. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a field of holographic stars set against an inky black background. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
You see the one-person fighter "F6f Hellcat" and the nine-person ameliorator "Quick Fix" powered down here.
You see an internal stun turret, three translucent security drones, a purple metal dumpster, a sparkly purple diving air compressor, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go north, south, and down.

13:56 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at "Fascination" Docking Bay.
You see a metallic red starship simulator and an internal stun turret here.
You can go down and out.

13:56 I don't understand that.

13:56 You press a small button on the front of a silver star-shaped device and watch as a transparent energy field around you fades into nothing.

The dome shaped sealing overhead in this massive docking bay has doors that open and close whenever ships arrive or depart the station. The floor is covered in different colored tiles, some are blue, while others are red or white. The walls are painted metallic black, and the room is well-lit. There is a heart in the center surrounding the letter K. The hustle and bustle of people leaving and entering the bay can be heard mingled with the sounds of ships landing or launching. Exits lead off into different directions, leading visitors to the different parts of the station. Rather prominent robotic arms can be seen, transporting ships back and forth from the landing pad to the garage through an enormous sliding door.
You see a holographic gold flashing billboard, a black wooden bench, a glowing corkboard, a cylindrical orange plastic trash can with several compartments in it, and several purple balloons tied to a statue of a white angel here.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central vi

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central vi

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a sma

You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows) here, sleeping.
You can go south.

23:24 You peer out and see...

23:24 [Heart of Night; Docking Bay]
The dome shaped sealing overhead in this massive docking bay has doors that open and close whenever ships arrive or depart the station. The floor is covered in different colored tiles, some are blue, while others are red or white. The walls are painted metallic black, and the room is well-lit. There is a heart in the center surrounding the letter K. The hustle and bustle of people leaving and entering the bay can be heard mingled with the sounds of ships landing or launching. Exits lead off into different directions, leading visitors to the different parts of the station. Rather prominent robotic arms can be seen, transporting ships back and forth from the landing pad to the garage through an enormous sliding door.
You see a holographic gold flashing billboard, a black wooden bench, a glowing corkboard, a cylindrical orange plastic trash can with several compartments in it, and several purple balloons tied to a statue of a white angel here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, south, and down.

23:43 ["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a sma
23:43 ll cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a bright turquoise cooler, a large sandstone fireplace with a stone harth and a teak mantel, a stack of neatly split logs, an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows, a rainbow-colored wicker coffee table, a velvet loveseat, a small turquoise glass end table, Maggie the bot, a purple velvet artifact storage container, a translucent architectural design simulator, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, a red handheld planetary surveyor, and Jenaia the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows) here, sleeping.
You can go south.

23:43 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:43 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:43 You peer out and see...

23:43 [Heart of Night; Public Garage]
This garage is well kept, with a rotation of drones cleaning up each time a ship enters or leaves. The walls are painted in various shades of gold. Underfoot the ground is a thick layer of red concrete. People can be seen going through a narrow door in the western wall out into the docking bay. A series of robotic arms latch on to ships and transport them to the docking bay, while others bring vessels into the room.
You see the three-person voyager "House of Balloons" and the eight-person gunship "Eternal Flame" powered down here.
You see nowhere obvious to go.

23:43 [General Communication] Michael Calaway transmits, "Where's the people."

23:43 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

23:43 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

23:43 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:43 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
