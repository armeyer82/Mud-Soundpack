Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a set of cream
cotton sheets, a soft white cashmere blanket, a soft golden brown satin pillow
with thick gold fringe, and a soft white satin pillow with thick gold fringe on
it, a small yellow bioplastic ship light, a woven cream wool rug with a yellow
border, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot,
a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower
quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a clear plastic food storage
container, a small white trash can, a compact red refrigerator, a white
microwave oven, a blue plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light
khaki canvas sneakers, a pair of sparkly white leather clogs, a light yellow
shipsuit with yellow trim around the collar and cuffs, a sapphire silk bullet
bra, and a pair of soft sapphire silk bikini panties here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go east.

a Tardick lizard named Raissa
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading RAISSA. It is asleep.

Akemi says to Melinda, "No, not with the ship."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Crew's a little demoralized the trip's
been cut short."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I will take the blame for that for
being silly."
Kim says to Melinda, "Are we certain it was the water pistol then?"
Melinda says to Kim, "Probably not but it did happen after the two pistols were
fired once each. Like five minutes after."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Just enough time for water to seep in
somewhere it shouldn't."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And we should try to come up with
something that can not damage the ship but still boost people's spirits."

"Is something wrong with our course?" Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her
face as she ponders.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Sometimes people don't think of
things like this happening. I've seen lots of water pistols on ships and used
them at other times. However, lesson learned and blame accepted."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "There's probably some fuse that's in the
guts of the control console that is blown out."
The room grows a bit more chill.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Probably."
Michael Winters says in a Candelaria accent, "Adjusting for the flow, probably."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I suppose a water pistol in a living
quarters or observation deck is slightly les risky than in here."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "If I baby it, we'll get back a little
quicker."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Play with water pistols in the showers."
The room grows a bit more chill.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "But, don't blame yourself. We all
had a lot of fun with it a few days back and even I never considered we might
hit something and damage the ship and ourselves in the process. And then it's
really not so hard to come to such a thought with all the tech in here."
Michael Winters glances down at his watch momentarily.
Simon Collins says in an English accent, "Or simply aim better."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I am just going to ban them from my
ships in the future."
Kim says to Melinda, "They should be fine in showers. They are made for water.
But whether you can aim at all in such a small space?"
Kim Saunders giggles.
Lily Kaise shrugs.
Melinda says to Kim, "That takes the fun out of the game."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "But yeah, they probably go better on
beaches or so."
Melinda says to Lily in a Bedford accent, "What?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Nothing."
Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Melinda says to Lily in a Bedford accent, "Why are you shrugging?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Because I can shrug."
"Why not?" Simon Collins shrugs.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Melinda says to Lily, "There is usually a reason for it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I don't wish to say anything. Sorry I
shrugged."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "We could always try more word games,
see if we have a dice game we can play, if we really want a bit of distraction."
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Can always get a lot of sleep!"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "A story telling game if people are
creative."

brought out the chains."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "And now I can' board my old ship, but
still have its key, and can't see how to return it to Vortex. Any ideas please?"
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "We can't not do stuff for fear bad
things will happen."
Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.
Lily Kaise chuckles.
Lily says to Melinda, "You are so right!"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "It should have been cleared out when you
got a new one."
Melinda says to Lily, "Discounting water as it will fry us."
Melinda Michaels laughs.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, if we sleep through our trip,
we might miss important things that happen. We need to be alert enough. But
feeling bad for ourselves and annoyed the trip got cut short, or worried and all
that, is also no solution."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Interesting, it wasn't cleared but I
can't locate it either."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So may energy spikes and just plain old
rift entities."
Melinda says to Lily, "You are correct. It could have been something like that
that zapped us."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Water is not wrong, as long as we
drink it instead of spraying it at stuff."
Kim Saunders giggles.
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Just get rid of the old key."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "I can't find a way other than dropping
it and then it just lies there."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Put it in a trash can."
Michael Winters yawns.
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "I'd suggest reporting that, because I
think that might be a bug. Happened to me too."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I obviously can't say with
certainty but we've had lots of fun with water pistols in the past. Perhaps
water did impact the control panel and I'd suggest that it's not a good idea to
use water or water pistols or anything similar around the electronics and other
systems of a starship."
Kim Saunders nods to Lily Kaise.
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "The old key will vanish given a little
time."

[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "If you don't want to wait for it to go on
its own, the trash can works."
Melinda says to Lily, "Yup, that's what some of us said as soon as it happened.
We just don't always think of everything at the times that we are having fun."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Looking back on it, we were not
really considering the risks. I can easily include myself in that because I
laughed just as hard when everyone got wet."
A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.
Michael Winters says in a Candelaria accent, "I'm going to grab a nap."
Michael Winters stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I'm more worried we'll get a wave of
actual water from the rift at some point."
Lily Kaise waves to Michael Winters.

good."
Kim Saunders smiles at Michael Winters. "Sleep well."
Michael Winters smiles at Kim Saunders.
Michael Winters strides southeast.

Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "We've gotten fish, sandwiches, wine,
weird bird rocks, chains..."
Something tickles the back of your neck.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Hmm."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It is not impossible. And this time
we truly got off lightly."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It's just a shame this ship does not
have some sort of recreation room."
-kim Maybe, I don't know. Being unable to talk or move for over 5 minutes wasn't
fun.
You say to Kim, "Maybe, I don't know. Being unable to talk or move for over 5
minutes wasn't fun."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "It will someday."
Simon Collins says in an English accent, "A ship like this should have one of
those, I mean you generally use ships like these for long trips like this..."
Sakura Arakida gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Sakura Arakida nods.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "It should. Though the upgraded
version of this gets it. Though this should as well."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "This ship is comparable to the stock
galleon in terms of amenities."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "But the stock galeon can get the
observation lounge, rec room and galley too. If I've read the book right."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I converted a couple of rooms on my
platform to other seating areas which could be used for recreation. Until you
have the upgrades, Akemi, that's something to consider."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Galleon."
Akemi says to Sakura, "That's right, the upgrades are available as soon as you
have the points."
A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tail.
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "For this ship though, they only offer
the upgrades for the Imperator refit. I assume it has to do with the work they
do to the Imperator to fit the rift bubble."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "And the Mainframe of course."
Sakura Arakida asks in a Japanese accent, "Rift bubble? Meaning the thing that
doesn't let you see rainbows and spider webs and what not?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "It's weird. They have the hook-up for
the navigation mainframe terminal in here already, and there's space for the
mainframe, but they won't sell it unless the ship's been fitted to Imperator
standards."
Akemi Bando nods to Sakura Arakida.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "That's a bit lame."
Sakura says to Akemi, "Are you going to try and apply for the refit again at
some point?"

Shysea Felryss does not seem to have an active communicator.
Akemi says to Sakura, "I don't know."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I'm not very happy with being turned
down twice."
Sakura says to Akemi, "Makes me wonder what they're looking for in your
application."
"I dunno if I will try again either." Melinda Michaels nods to Akemi Bando. "At
least not for a good while."
Blake Madison says in a Candelarian accent, "People keep telling me I should
apply again for the pincer."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "This ship's only really superior to the
galleon in terms of its life support capacity."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "In every other way the galleon is a
better ship."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup, Galleon Sails make it superior
in my opinion."
You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.
Sakura says to Blake in a Japanese accent, "I might not apply I more than likely
will just longterm rent one. Or does the rental need an application as well?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Well, this ship has good armament, but
the way we use these exploration ships we typically don't even have the weapons
powered up."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Lily says to Sakura, "The rental is not as powerful."
Akemi says to Sakura, "If you can get a galleon, get a galleon. They're a better
option compared to the tactical platform."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "If it were me, now if I had both of
these, and had to choose I'd take the galleon. It seems a bit more. Rift
capeable with those extra three sails. But that's just my opinion."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It is."
Melinda says to Sakura, "I have them both. My sloop is currently unable to be
launched in the garage."
The room grows a bit more chill.
Sakura says to Akemi, "I was going to go for that. Now that I think about it. It
may take me a very long time, but I think that's what I'll eventually go for."
For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
Sakura says to Melinda, "Why do you have both? When you've admitted you think
the galleon is better?"
Akemi Bando quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 235.0,
-44.0.
Melinda says to Sakura, "Because if I get the refit, this will be nice."
The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.
Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The mainframe is very useful."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "It saves needing to have a charter on
board."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I don't like it when my own ship shocks
me."
Kim Saunders nods. "Yeah, the mainframe is definitely a good way finding aid."
Melinda says to Akemi, "Yell at me for that. I am pretty sure it was water."
Sakura Arakida asks in a Japanese accent, "But for trips like this, do you
really need, someone who can chart?"
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "If they can't figure out what happened
when we get back, I'm just selling it back to them."
A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly southeast.
Kim says to Akemi, "I am sure they can figure it out."
Sakura Arakida hugs Akemi Bando.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "I am sure they will."
Sakura says to Akemi, "I don't blame you there."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Though I have thought of selling
mine till I decide to go for the refit again."
Kim says to Sakura, "Well, I suppose you could find your way home without a
charter, provided you are good at working with the NDB and have someone at home
willing and able to send you hypercasts. But a charter is definitely helpful."
Lily Kaise nods.
nod
You nod.
Sakura Arakida nods to Kim Saunders.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Valid point."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I suppose, if you wanted to take a
whole bunch of people to Feng Wo or so, the slightly larger life support
capacity may be a plus."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "The Mainframe only keeps data for a
couple of weeks as well so for longer trips, the oldest points roll off as the
data ages."
Sakura Arakida nods.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "But it'd be good for a small trip. Or
for going exploring like we did then finding your way home."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I've been part of larger crews and
smaller ones, and I'm not seeing as much of an advantage to running larger crews
from the perspective of the ship captain."
Melinda Michaels nods to Akemi Bando. "I agree."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "It adds a lot of overhead and potential
complication."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Smaller seems like it'd be better
from a we need to keep home defended standpoint."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo jumps down from Simon Collins's lap.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Seems to add a lot of conflect too
though this trip was really quiet."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Crew issues happen no matter what.
Smaller crews just mean you can catch the problem earlier."
"True." Sakura Arakida nods. "At least not a one of us is a tatiana."
Sakura Arakida grins.
"I personally would rather be a sakura." Sakura Arakida snickers. "Oh wait... I
am."
Melinda Michaels grins.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "That's another important point. The
personalities involved matter a lot too."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Yup."
Sakura Arakida grins.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "This crew is largely composed of very
experienced people. We all get along pretty well anyway."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
southwest.
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Then again, the universe can't handle
2 of someone so if another one of us was acting like a tatiana, the galaxy would
implode! And there's experienced people with some still or very inexperienced.
Zandria for one has never been on a trip, nor I believe has michle or morris.
I've been on 2 others, feng wo and the burning chain one. And I still say I'm
inexperienced. I just follow directions."
Sakura Arakida says in a Japanese accent, "Michael. Not mich."
Simon Collins says in an English accent, "Names don't say anything about
someone's personallity. Just because someone else would be called tatiana
doesn't mean that person would go around falsifying reports and do what ever
Croopin did."
Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed felo wanders in from the southwest.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Or calling people murderers when she
fabricates a letter."
Sakura Arakida grins at Simon Collins. "I know. I was trying to be funny."
Sakura Arakida laughs. "And naturally failed."

You say to Kim, "The one in which Lily threatened physical harm."
Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed felo wanders southwest.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, a crew of only 6 people was
also not comfortable. I spent many hours watching the ship by myself."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "A crew of ten or twelve is good."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I would say that there is a good
balance in this crew. A few people who can do the night shift, as I call it.
Some people who have a lot of experience, some who have medium experience, but
also some new pilots who are learning."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from

curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the

[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "What command do I use to dump the
box?"
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Empty box?"
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Or you tried that one."
[Newbie Help] Cilah Silverthorn transmits, "It's an ammo box."
[Newbie Help] Cilah Silverthorn transmits, "And, I'm not sure how to do that
without launching."
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Use a tug."
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Bring it in space like that then dump
the box."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Pretty sure you have to expel it."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Oh, when your launched, just expell."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Jettison works as well."
[Newbie Help] Cilah Silverthorn transmits, "Right but if you can't launch..."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Definitely some tug action needs to be
employed."
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Yup."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "If you can't launched just tell the
ships owner incharacter that you apolojise."
[Newbie Help] Simon Privorda transmits, "How can I attach my einrophone to my
phone holster?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Attach the holster to the phone. Then you
can wear the phone."
[Newbie Help] Simon Privorda transmits, "Thanks akemi."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Does this game have any keepalive
feature?"
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "The game doesn't disconnect you when
inactive."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "You'll remain connected indefinitely but
after an hour your character dozes off."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Not that I know of. It doesn't
disconnect for idleness though. Are you having trouble staying connected?"
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Yes, a lot of trouble. I cannot idel
for 5 mintues without it logging out."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Minutes."
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "That's on your end most likely then."
You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "You're sure it's not your internet
provider or mud client?"
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Do you guys have any ideas how I can
fix that?"
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "I've been connected for days at a time
without issue."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Might be my college wi-fi network. But
how can I fix that? Or is tehre not much I can do."
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "I ran into a similar problem when my
laptop was unplugged versus plugged in. Never did figure that one out."
A Tardick lizard named Isis trundles slowly into the area.
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Probably a power-saving feature on your
laptop being aggressive, Cesar. I had a problem like that with mine once."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "If it's your current network probably not
anything other than finding a stronger signal. I bet it was an energy saving
thing too."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "The only time it remains active is if
something is going on, then it is fine. But as soon as data stops flowing, it
just dies."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Check under Power Options, Advanced
settings for your active power plan."
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "That's probably a router thing then.
Disconnects when the data stops after a while."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Turn on SSN. That'll keep it active,
heheh."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Can't."
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Or hang out with felo."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Aquariums as well."
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Exploration wise the rift hallucinations
should keep things flowing data wise."
A Tardick lizard named Isis flicks its tongue out.
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I tried the hilusination one. Doesn't
work. It literally only has to stop for a minute then splat."
[Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "There's a server-side keepalive on all
connections anyway."
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Wacky then."
[Newbie Help] Klaus Stein transmits, "Probably something to do with your college
network. Have you had better success on other computers/networks?"
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Yes, back home I can stay connected
for weeks at a time, but here it just is horrible."
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Clearly the answer is to drop out of
college."
[Newbie Help] Cilah Silverthorn transmits, "Sounds like your network is designed
to not let you just idle places. I've heard of college networks doing stuff like
that before, as well as blocking ports and things like that. Unfortunately you
probably won't be able to do much about it."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle laughs.
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander chuckles.
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Hard to do when it's residential, and
it's also 300 miles away from home. Yeah, fun times."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Or, to go home. It's already June for
goodness' sake."
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "But yeah, sounds like an issue with the
college network. They typically run blockers to keep people from torrenting and
such."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "That's the stupid thing. I can torrant
and go to stuff like that just fine, but space moos are blocked. Fanticy stuff
is not, but space stuff is."
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Use your Iphone as a hotspot."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Or a VPN."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I wish I could. But they take those at
9 p.m at night, which is mainly when I get on here."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Have you tried the alternate port for the
game? It probably won't help, but trying simple things first usually doesn't
hurt."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Alternate port?"
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "The game is pretty easy on bandwidth if
you've got a phone to run a hotspot. I do it all the time in the field."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "There's 7777 and 7771."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "7771."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Thanks. Will give that a shot."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "They take what at 9 at night?"
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Phones."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "No college in the States would do such
things."
You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls,
followed by some scraping sounds.
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "When I say college, I'm referring to
postsecondary education."
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I know right."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Question. Would it be scripting to
have the client send a command say over 2 minutes when I type a certain alias,
just so that connections will stay alive? I can understand how it would be, just
want to clarify."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes."
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Ayup."
[Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "Squidmind said that there is a server-side
keep alive function built already. Just tell them to sign you into that?"
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Sounds like he needs constant outgoing
data though."
[Newbie Help] Robert O'Malley transmits, "I can't find the entrance to Battery
Park, where's the go exit for it?"
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Train ferry."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Damb, kind of hoped it wasn't so I
could send like perhaps an look command every 2 mintues just to keep the data
there. Ok, guess I just gotta some how deal."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Way up on the upper side of town."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Boo."
A Tardick lizard named Isis blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent
to its surroundings.
A Tardick lizard named Isis trundles slowly east.
You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls,
followed by some scraping sounds.
You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate
from the reactionless drive.
The captain yells into the PA microphone, "That's not fast enough! We have to
get out of here NOW!"
The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under
emergency boost.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.
The starship suddenly lurches in a new direction. Something must be wrong with
the inertial dampeners.
The ship's reactionless drive whirrs loudly as it changes direction rapidly.
The engineer's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Captain! The engine
can't take any more of this!"
The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."
The ship's reactionless drive lets out a sudden whine as the starship
accelerates quickly.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view,
forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.
The rainbow pathways suddenly begin to flash blindingly.
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.
Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally regular space.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

Star Conquest has a fully-realized space system as one of its primary features.
Space is big and it can be confusing. Sometimes intentionally! But here are the
basics.
SECTORS
Space is divided into sectors, which are simply a way of marking off and
differentiating volumes of space.
Sectors are three-dimensional, and are further subdivided into coordinates: 20

Numbers! Each sector is 240,000km across on each axis, or about 1/625th of an
astronomical unit, or about 8/10ths of a light-second. So, a lightyear is just
shy of 40 million sectors. This would be common knowledge among pilots.
BEACONS
A sector exists because a beacon has been placed there broadcasting its
location. This beacon is what allows starships to jump there using their
wormhole drive.
Beacons can be based on planets, on space stations, or free-floating in a beacon
housing.
There are three types of beacons you'll commonly encounter:
* Primary beacons: These are beacons for main sectors that you can jump to from
any location (with a few exceptions). Examples are Earthgate, Providence Gate,
or the Dusty Reaches. These are primary thoroughfares and also act as travel
bottlenecks.
* Secondary beacons: These are used within a sector cluster. For instance, Old
Earth Orbit and Martian Orbit are both marked by secondary beacons. What this
means is that from another sector cluster, you would first have to jump to
Earthgate, because that is the primary beacon for the cluster. From there, you
can jump to Old Earth or Mars, the secondary beacons.
* Weak beacons: These are not really a separate category, because primary or
secondary beacons can also be weak. Weak beacons do not broadcast over a wide
range, and generally a ship's computer must know of its approximate location
before it can scan for a weak beacon. Scanning will still usually take several
attempts. Weak beacons are used in Mutuality space to help it remain hidden.
SECURITY
Sectors also each have a security rating describing the degree of safety you can
expect there. Check the SECURITY RATINGS help file for more information.
MOVING BETWEEN SECTORS
You can travel to other sectors with your starship's JUMP command. You can type
this command by itself for a list of accessible sectors, or you can type JUMP
[sector name] to start traveling there immediately. For instance, JUMP EARTHGATE
will take you straight to the Earthgate sector from most locations.
Your starship can also successfully navigate multiple jumps. For instance, if
you're in a distant sector cluster and you type JUMP OLD EARTH, your ship will
automatically travel first to Earthgate and then make a second jump to Old Earth
Orbit. Linked jumps such as these will occur faster and use less battery charge
than if you performed the jumps individually.

Star Conquest Help: Security Ratings
--
Category: Game Systems
--
All sectors in Star Conquest possess a certain security rating. This security
rating has a primary rating, which goes from 'Alpha' to 'Delta.' Alpha sectors
are safest, while Delta sectors are the least safe.
Sectors also have a secondary numerical rating. Generally, a lower number is
safer. The primary exception to this is 'Delta' space, where a lower number is,
in fact, less safe. In short, a lower number further magnifies the qualities of
the primary rating.
The security ratings and their differences are listed below.
* Alpha (1): This security rating possesses space-based defense weaponry and the
local navy is always on standby, able to launch at a moment's notice. Even hatch
cracking and the launching of deployable weaponry is defended against.
* Beta (1-5): While lacking in space-based defenses, Beta sectors are protected
by alliance navies and the ports serve all non-hostile pilots. Sectors that are
rated 'Beta-2' or greater generally provide flight control reports to the public
flight control scanner.
* Gamma (1-4): Gamma sectors have no protection from alliance navies, but are
still controlled by alliances. As the Gamma rating increases, the ports become
pickier and pickier, first only serving allies and finally only serving their
own pilots. Some areas of Gamma space are influenced by localized conquest
results.
* Delta (10-0): Delta sectors are lawless areas of space controlled by various
factions. Alliances are ignored in lieu of factional ties. One thing to note is
that the space is considered more dangerous as the Delta number decreases.

Star Conquest Help: Decoy Beacons
--
Category: Activities
--
Decoy beacons are objects launched from a starship that tend to attract other
ships in the area. Often, these are ships hostile to humanity. Redirecting these
patrols and destroying them is helpful to humanity's war effort.
Decoy beacons and their launcher can be purchased at Accord of Free Worlds
Command.
Once you have purchased a launcher, it must be bolted in a ship's control room.
Decoy beacons can then be loaded into it.
Next, you must move into uncharted space. This means you simply move off of the
edge of any charted sector.
Once you are in uncharted space, type BEACON to launch your decoy beacon. You
may choose a signal strength for your beacon, which will directly affect the
level of response. (OOCly, these are difficulty levels.) The higher strengths
are NOT recommended unless you have a veteran crew.
Enemies typically take 2-3 minutes to respond, and will then respond with a
force proportionate to the strength and number of ships in the sector.
More friendly ships entering the sector will cause the enemy to call for
reinforcements.
The decoy beacon drop is successful when all enemy ships are destroyed, but be
warned! Launching the decoy beacon in a sector with RATS or other unfriendlies
will negate payout.
Enemies can only be fooled in this way so many times before they cease
responding.
OOC: In other words, you are able to do beacon drops eight times per Conquest
period. You can check this with the INFO command.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.

You press a silver button on the front of a large red popcorn popper with chrome
accents, and several dozen unpopped corn kernels fall into the machine's
microwave popping bin. The microwave switches on, and the kernels begin popping.
A blower activates, sweeping the popped popcorn up and around the bin where
waving nozzles spray them thoroughly with the desired flavorings, incidentally
leaving quite a mess on the walls of the popping bin, but as the finished
popcorn is sucked into a small red and white paper bag that has sprung up from
the bowels of the machine, a mechanical arm tipped with a squeegee emerges and
cleans the walls of the bin, afterwards grabbing the bag, thrusting it into your
waiting hand, and disappearing whence it came. For a brief moment the jubilant
cacophony of a choir of singing elves can be heard in the distance; then the
sound fades away, and the machine shuts down with a quiet wheeze.
