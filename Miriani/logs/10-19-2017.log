01:49 Kitty Mars says to you, "I have all of the furniture from the apartment on Empanda in an expediter. It will take a few trips to take the items to the apartment here on Acrylon. We could move back into Empanda as it seems a little less wild I think but don't keep important ships there or also put furniture in the apartment here as well and of course we can live up in 37 on Pinnacle or in my house on Desolo. Or we can just go where we feel like going at the time."

01:50 You say, "I'm almost like trying out somewhere in 37 as  or here on Acrylon. I'm not a fan of Empanda right now. It seems to be a target."

01:52 Kitty Mars asks you, "do you have a preference?"

01:53 You say, "Well, like I said, I'd almost prefer somewhere in 37 right now or here on Acrylon. Empanda is targeted too much for my taste."

01:55 You say, "37 is a bit far out there, but not too hard to get to. In an expediter, it's just jumping to 40 and then 37"

01:56 Kitty Mars says, "yeah well I'd like to have some furniture there it's just a huge chore to get furniture to the apartment on here so will work on it."

02:05 [Newbie] Magnus Brandrsson: If, say, two pilots with keys to a fighter are together in the command room, on a mission, can one pilot fly while the other shoots? I mean, stick a couch in there and it seems doable. Cramped, but doable.

02:06 [Newbie] Cara West: You'd not get paid as much since the mission would be over full. If you want to do 2 person missions, get a vanguard it lets you do the same thing. One flies and shoots, the other shoots and repairs.

Lore Computer
--------------------------------------------------
Lore computers are small devices that can be extraordinarily helpful. They feature a memo program for writing, reading, and transferring text files, optical character recognition for scanning signs into your computer, a scratch pad for quick notes, a unit converter, a calculator, a tracking system, a shopping guide, a news uplink, and a variety of other functions. Operating a Lore computer is extremely simple, and there are a number of options available. It's best to just use the computer and try the various functions for yourself. However, to get you started, here are some explanations of the available hardware and software.

  Hardware
Lore computers come with several hardware slots as well as hardware expansion cards. To load a card, you simply type LOAD [card name]. To remove a card, you merely UNLOAD [Lore Computer Name].

Translink - A TransLink expansion card will enable you to perform two additional functions with your Lore computer.  First, it will enable you to enter the Lore ID of other Lore computers you'd like to let track the location of your Lore computer.  Second, it will allow you to track Lore computers of people who have authorized you to do so.  Please note this will only track the Lore computer and not it's owner so if the two should ever become separated, your results may not be what you expect. Furthermore, Loretech Industries bare
12:30 s no responsibility for anything that goes wrong as a result of tracking people.

Character Recognition -  A Character Recognition expansion card will enable your Lore computer to scan a document and then allow you to import it as a file onto your lore computer. You will have the opportunity to give the file a name after the scan is completed.

Printer - A Printer expansion card will enable your Lore computer to make printed hard copies of documents saved in it's memory.  Due to the wonders of Loretech technology, the printer is rated for over 1 trillion prints before needing replacement.

Biometric Scanner - A Biometric Scanner expansion card will provide additional security for your Lore computer.  It will allow you to take biometric readings of anyone in the same location as you to provide them access to your lore computer should they become in possession of it.  Anyone that is not in the biometric scanners database will be denied access to your system. If, for some reason, the biometric card should be removed without first clearing the stored identities, your Lore computer will be locked down until a biometric card is inserted again.

Speech Synthesis - A Speech Synthesis expansion card will enable you to command your Lore computer to output, in a synthesized voice, anything you write on the Lore computer's scratchpad.  This output will be visible to anyone in the same location as you.

Holographic Imager - Thi
12:30 s card allows you to take detailed images of a room, an object, or a group of objects. When prompted for a target, type group to choose who to include in an image. Once an image has been taken, you can access it from your Lore's holographic image album. After loading blank discs, you can also copy the data to a disc that will function similarly to a standard photograph, with one important exception: You can look at the individual objects in every picture. Simply LOOK <object name> IN <picture name> to look at anything that was present at the time the picture was taken.

Image Data Extractor - An image extractor allows a Lore computer to download the data from an image disc and import it into their photo album.

  Software
The Lore computer also comes with several useful software programs which enable you to perform a variety of functions.

File Management (Memopad) - The file management function allows you to create and store text documents. The interface is fairly straightforward, allowing you to add files and folders as well as edit, delete, or transfer them from one person to another. Anything you scan with the OCR card will end up in the file management.

Sundial - The sundial simply displays the current date and time.

Scratch Pad - The scratch pad is a place to quickly jot down notes. Once you finish writing a note, you can show it to somebody else in the room, print it to a file, or, if available, output the text to your speech synthesizer card to have it read to everybody in the room.

Calculator - The calculator allows you to quickly and easily enter equations into your Lore computer and receive the result. If you wish to perform multiple related calculations, you may use the # character to substitute with the value from your last equation. 

Examples: 
(5+5) * 8
The result of your equation, 80.0, briefly appears on the display.
5 + 5 * 8
The result of your equation, 45.0, briefly appears on the display.
35 + #
The result of your equation, 80.0, briefly appears on the display.

Unit Converter
The unit converter allows you to convert a number from one type to another. For detailed instructions on using the unit converter, select the option on your Lore menu and type HELP.

Tracking 
If you have a Translink card, your Lore computer is capable both of tracking and being tracked. Be aware, however, that you will be unable to track Lore computers that are travelling through wormholes or out of communications range.

Shopping Guide
The shopping guide is perhaps the most used function of the Lore computer. It automatically pulls data from stores in realtime to find the items you want. It can list every store category at once, list only upgrades, or it can search by string. There are a few limitations, especially with repeating items, but for the most part the shopping guide is an extremely valuable resource.

Galactic News
The news program allows you to see the most recent news, sorted newest to oldest.

Player-owned Space Stations, Moons, and Planets
--------------------------------------------------
PLANETS, MOONS, AND SPACESTATIONS:

Q: What do I need to get a planet, moon, or spacestation?
A: For spacestations, you need 10 billion credits and 10000 points. For moons, you need 20 billion credits and 15000 points. For planets, you need 30 billion credits and 25000 points. You also pay additional fees for each room you add.

Q: Where can I put my spacestation, planet, or moon?
A: In any sector, including places out of local space, except sector 24, sector 15, sector 12, sector 9, sector 13, sector 19, sector 0, sector 30, sector 115, sector 14 and sector 32. These sectors are subject to change and can be added to at any time.

Q: What can these fine places have?!
A: They can have an optional pool, an optional hot tub, and an optional private garage. You also may have a security center which allows you to control flight control and monitor rooms on the station, planet, or moon. You can also have a room that monitors the sector around your station, planet, or moon. Additionally, you're allowed to have five custom item stores for a station, seven custom item stores for a moon, and nine custom item stores for a planet. Any additional stores will have to be a tradesman item. Custom item stores are defined as stores with special clothing, food or other collectable items. You may have a transport pod as long as the station, planet, or moon is not out of local space. Player-owned space stations, planets, and moons cannot contain facilities that allow for point transfers to take place, including artifact research centers, passenger transport facilities, etc. Stations, planets and moons cannot be self-contained. This means you cannot design a station that eliminates your need to travel to other planets to obtain specific services or goods. Example: starship registries.

Q: Can my station be armed?!?!
A: Sorry, no.

Q: Can I keep people out of my station, planet, or moon?
A: You can control flight control which will deny docking to a whole alliance, everybody but owners and caretakers, or specific ships based on your choice. If landing is disabled to all, even the ITPN station becomes non-functional.

Q: ITPN Stations??! Oh my oh my! What do they entail?!
A: All private space stations, moons and planets are required to have an ITPN station on them. These stations cannot be past a security checkpoint, meaning that everybody has to be able to get to them. ITPN stations may have only a single destination. The destination is determined by the sector that your private space station, moon or planet is in. If there is already a planet, moon or station in the sector you are building in, your ITPN destination goes to that location. Otherwise, the ITPN pod will go to the sector hub. That's Pax for sectors 1 through 20, and the ITPN hub in secto
13:40 r 33 for sectors 21 through 40. An example would be if a person build a moon in sector 31. There is a planet there with an ITPN station already, so the one on the private moon would go to that planet, which would then go to the hub. Private space stations, moons and planets not in a numbered sector can not have an ITPN station.

Building Commands
--------------------------------------------------
As you advance through your Miriani piloting career, you may find that you have accumulated enough wealth and prestige to begin thinking about making a more permanent presence for yourself. Be it a house, a space station, or even a planetary colony, you will need to build it up. The following commands will help you in your journey:

Command: Dig
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dig [direction] to [room name]
        dig [direction]
        dig enter
        dig enter to [room name]
This command allows you to create a new room in the specified direction. If you don't specify a room name, Miriani will attempt to automatically link the room you're into to the room [direction] from you. To find out which room is in any given direction, you can type PREDICT [direction]. Using 'enter' in place of a direction will make a biometrically protected door that you must ENTER to go through. You can only do this from a room that is outdoors.

Command: Parent
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: parent
Allows you to select what type of room you wish to change the current room into. For instance, if you want the room you're standing in to become a docking bay, you simply type PARENT and choose docking bay.

Command: Demolish
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish [direction]
Allows you to demolish a single room in the direction you specify. This command will only proceed, however, if the room you're demolishing will not leave other sections of your station/house inaccessible. Imagine a situation where you have an area that forms a large circle with two connected rooms in the center. If you demolish the room to the east, it would succeed because you could still reach the second middle room from the other side of the circle. Typically one will only be demolishing rooms that only have a single exit (returning to the room you're standing in)

Command: Demolish-exit
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: demolish-exit [direction]
Allows you to remove a single exit (and its return exit) without destroying any rooms. The command will refuse to run if removing the exit will leave rooms inaccessible.

Command: Predict
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: predict [direction]
This command allows you to check what room you'll be linking to if you try and connect two rooms. If this makes no sense, here is an example:

You have dug a room north from your current position (room A), and another to the east (room B). If you wanted to form a triangle, you could walk east to room B and then PREDICT NW. The game would then recognize room A and inform you that room A exists northwest. Using this information, you can then DIG NW to make the connection and form the triangle.

Command: Describe
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: describe
Prompts you to submit a new description for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Ren
13:40 ame
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: rename
Prompts you to submit a new name for the room you're currently standing in.

Command: Dooradd
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: dooradd [direction]
Allows you to create a door in the given direction. The appropriate prefix for the door will be automatically applied, so you should name a door 'blue metal door' rather than 'a blue metal door'.

Command: Doorremove 
Applies: Anywhere
Syntax: doorremove [direction]
This allows you to remove doors which have been added with the dooradd command.

Command: Biometric
Applies: Only in a security center
Syntax: biometric
Allows you to add and remove the biometric registrants for each individual biometric door.

13:42 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, a dark blue suede sofa, a slim blue medical drone, and a transparent architectural design simulator here.

d
Let people buy and sell credits from each other but do it in a way so that the game can collect 5% or so from every transaction. Could create some kind of web based money market and utilize Paypal. This would make people who used to play the game want to log on and liquidate their credits maybe, it would also make new people want to play the game with the desire of selling credits. It would also make the game easier for casual players who are money rich and time poor.

It would generate more subscriptions (donations) since people could sell their credits to buy donation time and sell their certs to get credits etc. For every transaction that happened the game would have to be collecting it's 5% though. Coupled with donations this money could easily go toward creating twice yearly or more 'Service Packs' with potentially new activities, planets to explore and even new and different ships. The service packs could be acquired through a one time donation of $5 which would also give you donator status for that month etc. and they wouldn't be 'required' to play the game, just improve upon the experience so it would still keep 'free to play' status.


22:11 Lots of ways this could go wrong, be abused, etc. However if it was developed to be balanced from the get go then it should be okay. There may have to be limitations on the amount of credits people can sell or buy in a certain period of time, etc. This of course would also basically assume you were taking away the roleplay requirement as well, which also couldn't hurt anything at this point. There are already lots of systems in place for this to be a thing, and there are certainly legal liabilities and all sorts of things like that to think about, but it may make the game really popular and successful if that is something people might want to see in the future.

23:58 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, a dark blue suede sofa, a slim blue medical drone, and a transparent architectural design simulator here.
