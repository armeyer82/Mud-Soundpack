Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Hyperion; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, and Purr the humanoid
service robot here.
You can go south and out.

I have at where I am. Do I need to go to somewhere else to research these? It
says they are not registered to examine wreckage from that site."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Are the artifacts from second battle,
or the drift funnel?"
[Newbie Help] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Second Battle."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Where are you trying to hand them in?"
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "You have to use Drift Funnel for those."
[Newbie Help] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "The station at Belt of Orion."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "No, use the one at Drift Funnel, only
place that takes them."
[Newbie Help] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Gotcha. Thank you."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Right, any artifacts from the drift
funnel, or second battle, you need to hand in at drift funnel."

salvage processor before the other one goes offline as it will be tomorrow
morning and I don'tthink either of us will want to trek out there just before
toing to sleep. The scooping staiton will go down too but if we're still awake,
it will be easy to go drop that one."

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay
Four.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid
service robot, and Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo here.
You can go south and out.

*** Tandem Pact Announces Technology Breakthrough
This morning, the Tandem Pact's top joint research team, MLO-00, announced a
breakthrough in starship combat grid and battery technology.
The new battery design allows a ship to generate wormholes at twice the normal
efficiency as well as optimizing weapon systems for efficiency, allowing a
starship's weapons to operate at 125% of their rated energy efficiency. The new
combat grid design sacrifices charge capacity for recharge speed, granting a
recharge rate previously only dreamed of in inexpensive components.
Researchers were quoted as saying the following:
  - "This is our pride and joy. I hope to live to a day where I see this
equipped on every vessel, Tandem Pact or not."
  - "This glimmer of forsaken light beckons a deluge of darkness to embrace."
  - "This'ns a good'n. It'll make me rich, 'specially when I'm usin' it on some
chump."

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

Many pilots have approached me with complaints regarding batteries and how they
can know that a battery is good for them. Since a battery is such a vital
component to a ship's functioning at maximum efficiency, I will take the time to
talk about them in detail in this section.
The battery has three things that a pilot should look at. The overall efficiency
is the battery's charge. The higher the overall efficiency is, the greater your
ship charge will be.
Combat grid usage is how much of a battery will be used to recharge a combat
grid. The higher the combat grid usage is, the slower the grid will actually
recharge.
Wormhole drive usage is the amount of charge from a battery the wormhole drive
uses to make a jump point. The higher the wormhole drive usage is, the more
power a ship will use from the ship's batteries. For example, 250% will use
approximately 12 minutes of ship charge to make a wormhole jump.
Finally, we have maximum engine speed. It's not as some people believe, how fast
the ship will go when it's at full speed, but more how fast the ship will start
moving if it has an engine that has the same instantaneous velocity of a
battery's max engine speed. The instantaneous velocity of your ship will be the
instantaneous velocity of the slower component, whether that is the battery or
the engine.

option to do so. I have already written a statement concerning the violance and

a white air foam bed with a white flannel bedsheet, a blue flannel blanket, and
a white flannel pillow on it
This bed, designed for use in starships, is molded with slightly raised sides to
form a semi-enclosed space for the sleeper, preventing roll-outs from
unexpectedly hard landings, oblique take-offs, or turbulent wormhole jumps. The
bed ensures a comfortable cycle's sleep as the air foam cushions the body but
quickly resumes its original shape once pressure is removed.
On top of it you see a white flannel bedsheet, a blue flannel blanket, and a

the following items. First, our public response and statement to the recent
outbreaks of violence of AEU citizens against members of other alliances."

proposal for a fundraiser, to help supply medical creches for AEU citizens in
need of medical attention who can not afford this."

Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "It's nothing that I didn't honestly expect since we've
always really had issues with the Mutuality. To be honest, they don't really
like us, and we've not been prime examples, what with the slave trade, and the
rogue navy."

Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It is true that
the mutuality is not so thrilled with us, understandable if you look at the
recent history of the AEU pilot core indeed. I can not entirely blame them for
distrusting us."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "But these

Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth
He appears to be 47 years old. He is about five feet and six inches tall and has
ruddy skin. His body is slightly pudgy with rounded hips and average calves. He
has rounded shoulders and a barrel-shaped chest. His face is broad and haggard,
with a beak-like nose and understated chin. His lips are flat and occasionally
part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of bushy eyebrows, his eyes
are blue and widely-set. His very short, bristly hair is salt and pepper and
neatly combed. He also has a short salt and pepper unstyled beard.
 He is wearing a crisp white shirt, a leather belt with an eye-catching golden
buckle recognizably in the shape of the continents of Telex, a pair of black
silk trousers, and a pair of heavy hobnail boots. He is also wearing a slim
electronic reader, a metachannel FTL communicator, and a low-slung hip holster.
His head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying a black cowboy hat in his right hand.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Ok."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "For now, I just

--
We, the undersigned, pilots of the AEU civilian pilot core, have learned with
shock about the recent outbreaks of violence against a League business Man,
Fringe student and an unregistered person, and any other such cases. It is
equally disturbing that people were willing to burn down a library provided to
us by the EAOS.
We would like to offer our support to the surviving victims and their families.
We also offer our heart felt condolences to the families and friends of anyone
who was killed as a result of these acts of violence.
We hope that these cases will be investigated and the responsible criminals will
be brought to justice as soon as possible, and that a stop is put to this
unnecesary waste of life. We understand that we all grew up with different
backgrounds, different world views, but we hope that we can talk about our
differences and find peaceful solutions rather than resorting to violence.
We join the civilian pilots of the League, Fringe and Mutuality in their call
for understanding, peace and a swift solution to this crisis. Our thoughts go
out to everyone who is suffering, to everyone who has been attacked. Most
importantly, we call out to our own people, citizens of the AEU, please consider
what you are doing and stop these attacks.
Signed sincerely,
Kim Saunders

something."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth nods.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in General/Exploration.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "It has our

Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

this taking so long, I of course want to do this correctly."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "If everyone can

do about that, but I thought it should be noted."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Seeing as there are not many civilian pilots active, and the
three most vocal ones signed it and the other vocal one is a complete moron,
people will not pay it too much attention."

Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I have about

Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Well, regarding the medical creche thing, if I may..."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Ather Jammoa. "You may, it is next on
our agenda."
Ather Jammoa asks in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Mr. Lambeth, the credits in this donations box were meant to
be used for a survey expedition for an asteroid field. Having not heard anything
about it, and seeing that the credits are still in this box, did the expedition
ever even launch? If not, and if they don't need the money, can we use the
credits in this donations box to fund the project?"
Ather nods to a patriotically painted donations box as he speaks.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth approaches a patriotically painted donations box.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says in a Telexan accent, "Hmm. Well. Yes. Hmm.
Well."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I am surprised

Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New

irrelevant now."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says in a Telexan accent, "Th' miraculous nature of
'lectronic credits means they ain't occupyin' any space, includin' this box. But
Ah can attempt ta git an accountin' o' where this money is at, if y'all would
like."
Ather says to Andrew in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Well, I didn't mean literally in the box!"
Ather says to Andrew in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Anyway, yeah, that works for me."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "If the credits were used and the survey was later considered
irrelevant for whatever reason, then we can just reset the box, and open
donations for the medical creche thing."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yes, I would
appreciate that. If it has been used on something, it is good to know that, and
if those credits are somewhere, it is also good to know, so we can see what can
be done with them. Other than gathering dust."

You say, "Definitely."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Agreed."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New

Lily's opinion once again doesn't count."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Ok, well, point
3, the hardest one of them all I think."
Ather Jammoa sighs.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Point 2 will be
back on some future agenda I am sure."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "I freely admit, I
am honestly not quite sure where to begin. Maybe by summarizing some of the
problems we seem to be having?"
Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Problem 1, we are
not a united group of pilots, we have no common goal. There are few enough of us
as it is, and most don't care enough about their future as a civilian pilot to
participate in a meeting."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Sorry if this
sounds harsh."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "I wouldn't say most. Out of the active pilots, only one
refused to participate."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "And all she cares about is earning credits and command
points."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says in a Telexan accent, "Angel Martin is active
now an' then too, but Ah reckon her presence wouldn't be too productive."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "True."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "I still say that Lily needs to be penalized for refusing to
attend this meeting."
"Yeah, maybe not." Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods. "But she has been seen
and she did not decide that coming here would be a good idea. Maybe that is not
as actively refusing as what Lily did. But..."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Especially since she did instigate the other alliances with
her attack on Melinda, and then wouldn't even come to a meeting where we're
trying to salvage the situation."
Ather says to Kim, "I'm inclined to beleive that if Angel was awake and active
when the meeting started, she'd probably have come. Though as Mr. Lambeth said,
I don't know if she would've had any valuable input."
"I do not think we have the power to penalize Lily?" Voice of the Corps Kim
Saunders looks at Ather Jammoa thoughtfully.
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "We can politely request that the liaison office temporarily
revoke her license."
Ather Jammoa beams at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Lily has handled this entire situation very childishly."
Kim looks torn for several moments.
Andrew scratches his head. "Well... her refusal to attend might speak to her
character... but keep in mind it ain't a mandatory meetin'."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Temporarily revoking her license will show the other
alliances that we won't tolerate her carelessness. Which will make some people
happy, I suppose."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I would like to
be honest on a few points."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "First, it is fair
to state that Lily and myself have had a very poor working relationship in the
past several months. Maybe part of it is to blame on me, but certainly not all."
Ather says to Andrew, "She had a part to play in what transpired. Maybe having
the voice back wouldn't have helped anything in the grand scheme of things, but
actively refusing to return when she heard that unpleasant things were going on
back home as you said, speaks a lot about her character. Taking this harsh step
of temporarily revoking her license might appeaze some of the other alliances,
which believe that we have grown complacent. While I could care less about the
opinions of all of those other alliances, politically, it might be a sound
strategy."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Secondly, I
already posted on the general message board, for all to see, that I was the one
who told Melinda Michaels that Lily complained about being misrepresented.
Probably did not help matters, not that I regret telling Melinda she was being
accused, in my opinion, wrongly."
Ather says to Kim, "In the past, when we've wanted something to stay under
wraps, particularly a message board post, we'd generally stipulate such in the
message itself. Lily did not do so. So, it's irrelevant."
Andrew sets his hat down on the table and sighs deeply. "If we're gonna start
assignin' responsibility fer th' situation we find ourselves in, Ah don't reckon
it begins an' ends with Lily Kaise."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Perhaps not."

Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New

in the past. Heck, I had to apologize to the unrethe Mutuality council folk in
as public a setting as you can get for my own issue."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "What Lily didn't
do in the past few weeks really only added to a pile of bad decisions, some from
before I ever became a pilot."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "As for the rest of it, most of the other bad decisions that
really killed us revolved around the slavers. People still talk about that
incident."

Phoenecian accent, "Because it's the league woo league."

Lily Kaise smiles.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, better late
than not at all. We are currently discussing the AEU pilot corps and how other
alliances view it, and all that."
Lily Kaise nods.
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "We've had our streeks of bad luck. Unfortunately, they've
been moreso than other alliances. It's like people have become pilots in our
alliance just for the sake of sabotaging it. The slavers, Tatiana, Takana,
Nils..."
Lily Kaise nods to Ather Jammoa.
'So, question is, what do we do from here?
You ask, "So, question is, what do we do from here?"
Ather turns a brief glare towards Lily, before glancing back at the other pilots
and saying, "that being said, it's understandable why the other alliances view
us as we do. However, we've actually punished the people who have done wrong.
Those we've been able to swiftly apprehend. In fact, the only one that's still
missing for us is Nils, and she's well enough out of our reach for now."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'd say one issue is that some aren't
even loyal to the AEU itself it seems."
Ather says to Lily, "Especially those who decide to come to a meeting two hours
late, it's true."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So if there's disunity already, others
recognize it."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says in a Telexan accent, "As an alliance, Ah
reckon we've chosen the road where th' opinions of others don't matter all thet
much to us."
Kim frowns deeply: "I remember my psych evaluation, it was tough. That makes me
wonder how so many accidents slipped through. Was someone who evaluated them
sleeping, or were they so good at hiding their flaws? I have wondered about that
quite a few times."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Most of that choice was made by necessity. When others fuck
up and either retire, leave, or go join a band of pirates."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Or their parents paid the admissions
offices for the academy they were trained in."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Or go to prison, I supose. We've had plenty of that."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, I can't
speak for anyone else, but they still matter to me. Those opinions of others."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yes they do matter because if one of
them declares war on us, we have to deal with all of them, not just one."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So how their citizens and their pilots
are treated is important."
Kim says to Lily, "Well, I suppose people would notice disunity among us, are
you speaking generally, or about one person in particular here?""
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says in a Telexan accent, "Y'all might believe
that, but most of th' alliance didn't."
Ather says to Lily, "Not necessarily true. Generally from what I was led to
believe, their full alliance pacts mainly have to do with defense. If one of
them first instigates a fight, it doesn't mean that the other two alliances will
join in. If they did, it would probably be a voluntary-type thing. If we
attacked them now, that would open up a door for the others to retaliate."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Generally of course. I'm sure if one
isn't loyal, they know."
-ather Oh, I thought they had to defend each other even if one of them declared
war. I appreciate the clarification.
You say to Ather, "Oh, I thought they had to defend each other even if one of
them declared war. I appreciate the clarification."
Lily says to Ather, "But what would prevent them from not supporting those they
are allied with?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Scoop."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "They could, but then they would violate the NAPS we set up
with them individually. Now, I suppose the Mutuality could, since we have no
diplomatic relations with them, but that's another issue entirely."

You say, "I just hope it never comes to that. I personally don't think we have
enough pilots to wage war."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Now obviously, if any of them declares war, I suppose their
NAP agreement is made irrelevant regardless, but eh."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods.
Lily Kaise nods to Ather Jammoa.
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Anyway, straying off the topic, I suppose."
Lily Kaise nods.

You nod.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm just stating an underlying reason
why we really do need to get along with all alliances no matter how difficult it
may be to swallow at times."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's hard to accept it when a Mutuality
pilot literally gets in your face and starts berating the alliance you were born
into but sometimes..."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Basically, you can't over night fix the problems that were
caused by all of the people in the past. The slaver stain, like I said, is still
big. It's constantly talked about, even though no one cares still that a league
pilot was involved and hasn't been caught because the league can't possibly do
any wrong woo league. To say nothing of the more recent issues with Takana,
Tatiana and Nils and yes, Lily, your issue, too when you refused to come home to
take up your position when we wanted more information."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "We should've had this meeting long before this, and released
a statement before the pilots of the other alliances. However, when you forced
the recall, and Kim had to deal with the transition, we were set back by a
substantial enough margin."
'It's true. We can't fix everything over night.
You say, "It's true. We can't fix everything over night."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well none of you, absolutely none of you
indicted you were in the least, interested in my coming back. I also did not and
I'll say emphatically, did not 'refuse' to come back. Michaels chose to leave in
a hurry and I'll stand on that because there was more I wanted to discuss with
her and I couldn't understandy why you all seemed disinterested."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "No one else seems to be telling the same story, and none of
them have a vested interest in fabricating it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "You all had the same I also represented
you all and what you all wanted as well."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, it seems to
me that, before we can do anything else, we need to give this recent incident
and the resulting disunity some air."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I'm telling you my own story and
that is fact."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Michaels welked out of the ship and
didn't even bother to repeat my statement back to me which she assumed."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I went to the bar and was going to ask
her if she would please hang back a bit and she left."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yes we did go to Tom Town and got
johann's upgrade and we left the next day."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anyway, just shows how there is no unity
amongst our alliance as well."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "I mean what did you want, for us to send signed papers with
Melinda saying "Lily oh please come baaaaaaack!" We figured that the tacet
approval of her expedition was signal enough. I was never around during the time
slots to send hyperwave communications, and I figured that Akemi's sending you
all the news might at least spur you into action."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No a simple request via the hyperwave
would have been absolutely fine."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Or via Melinda when I asked her did
Ather Jammoa or anyone else from the aEU send you here?"
Ather Jammoa asks in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "So a simple request using the hyperwave would've been fine,
but someone flying over there to ask you to come back was not fine just because
she's league?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well she was only representing herself
she said."
Ather Jammoa shakes his head.
Andrew picks up his hat, plants it back on his head, and gets to his feet. "Ah
reckon this has ceased bein' productive. If thar's nothin' else?"
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth stands up from an ergonomically designed silver
mesh chair.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I did not turn my
comms on for 1 day. Before then, there was 1 headline, once I turned it back on
and checked my news, there were quite a few more and I was told that Melinda had
decided to go bring you the news because we could not reach you by quantum
entanglement, nor could you us. So you also could not tell us whether you
received the news."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "I'm done, what else you got, Kim? I'm tired of this circular
bullshit."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders removes a small black leather portfolio from a
sturdy jungle camouflage canvas backpack.

the League and nobody from AEU was bothering to seem to care about it. So I was
in a quandry about who do I respond to here? My own alliance or League?"

this circular thing by something I have in here."

--
During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived
at Famous Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long
time since we drifted off course en route and it required about
another day to get our bearings and to correct our course. When
melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would likely want
to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back
in Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to
prepare a written statement as well albeit I didn't ask permission
to do so but I really wasn't given the time to ask very many
questions.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda into the Control Room of the ship and the
exchange began like this. I asked? 'so Melinda do you have a
letter from Nissi?
Melinda Michaels says. "I do not, she is, um, unavailable."
Melinda then says, "So we are running without either voice
currently."
I nodd to Melinda.
I then asked Melinda? 'so who did she appoint to act on her
behalf?
"She did not appoint anybody," Melinda says. "I took it upon myself
to come out here and make sure you guys knew."
I then said to Melinda. 'well first off, I want to thank you for
your efforts in traveling out here.
Melinda next said. "Since she is not available, I will probably
take it upon myself to send whatever letters are needed," Melinda
says. "Somebody has to."
I then went further to state. 'Second, I want to express that i am
very troubled by the news. However, do consider that crime happens
to all citizens of all alliances.
'I am not happy with what has occurred.
Melinda then nodded in agreement.
I then said to Melinda. 'Still, I am not the Military. I am not
the aEU Government. My job is to be a messenger to our Government
Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and nothing more.
I added with another question? 'So too, did Ather Jammoa send you
here?
"Nobody sent me," says Melinda.
I then said. 'ok well Akemi was acting rather hysterical saying
that I was wanted back there so I'm just trying to understand who
wants me back there.
Melinda, obviously not hearing my question says. "You are the
voice," says Melinda, "troubling times are at hand and here I am."
Melinda says, "We want some kind of word, people are getting
upset."
I responded with. 'yes but if our government felt I should be
there, they have the means to dispatch that request to me. I
informed them before I left of my plans as well.
Melinda asked the following which I hoped would be a good faith
effort on her part to convey my need for clarification. "So," asks
Melinda, "this is what you want me to tell people if they ask?"
She cut me off you see as I wasn't finished with what I had to say
which was. 'Even if i were there, I am not the party who can
control the behavior of aEU citizens.
Melinda says, "Of course you can't."
She continued with. "So, since you weren't asked for in an
official capasity, you will remain on said trip," Melinda says. "Is
this correct?"
I concurred by saying. 'well it's very much out of my hands. They
need to understand that it's not within my power to control AEU
Citizens. It is our government's responsibility to deal with those
issues. You can certainly convey to them in o uncertain terms that
I am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical over-
emphasis on the partof the media and related to recent elections no
doubt.
Melinda says, "Okay I will do this."
Melinda says, "All right."
Melinda Michaels then stood up to leave without repeating anything
back to me as well as she didn't let me finish what I was saying.
I just went on by stating. 'If I were back there, there really
isn't anything I could do.
Melinda then says, "I just hope nobody else dies."
She still wasn't allowing me to complete my statement. so I went
on to say. 'AEU pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to
me as well.. "That's fine," says Melinda.
Melinda says, "I tried."
'Thank you for doing so.
Melinda waved. Then she says, o very unceremoniously, Melinda
says, "Yup."
Melinda says, "Later."
I waved back rather amazed that she seemed both not interested in
what I was trying to gather from the scant information I had as
well as nothing official from the leadership from the league nor
Ather Jammoa or from any other AEU pilot back in Comms.
Melinda Michaels then rather rudely walked out. There is certainly more that I
would like to have discussed or to have asked if I could prepare a written
statement or even asked for a brief period of time to consider a request which
didn't come to me in an official capacity. Still, I would have. I took time to
consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the AEU
seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann in
his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went on
to Tom Town to charge overnight. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship
was charge onto Sea of Fears the next day. After a rather sleepless night, when
I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and very
apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at Sea of
Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better grasp of
the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann was very
gracious and he
said that he understood my concerns and that we could return to
Comms. Since there was no other means aboard Johann's Galleon to
communicate that we were returning, it is unfortunate that a hasty
decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf. I further find
it regretable that Melinda was in so much of a hurry not to allow
me to prepare a written statement which I couldn't have prepared
before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on. I apologize
to you all though as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation was
in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the plans
of
others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that Ather
Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't have
hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison office.

Kim says to Lily, "The paper I just placed on the table, would you tell me what
that is?"
Lily says to Kim, "So who provided this to you?"

it from Johann, but, what is it?"

[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Conference Room]
This large room is simply but elegantly decorated with pale green carpeting and
light gray walls. Deep green ferns in white planters sit in the corners, and on
the wall opposite the door is a large silver and green AEU logo, gleaming in the
recessed lighting. In the center of the room is a large round table of brushed
steel surrounded by ergonomically contoured silver mesh chairs. The door is
closed.
You see the AEU civilian pilot corps voting machine, the AEU nomination machine,
a patriotically painted donations box, a shiny green trash bin, and Magellan the
arachnoid security robot here.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth is standing here. Ather Jammoa, Voice of the Corps
Kim Saunders, and Lily Kaise are sitting on an ergonomically designed silver
mesh chair.
You can go south.
(You are sitting on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.)
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "And where did she obtain it from?"
Ather Jammoa says, OOCly, "Come on guys, no mud logs please! My IC self is
obviously annoyed with Lily, but my OOC self says we really shouldn't present
this at a meeting."
Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "I agree."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders removes a sheet of white paper from a large
round table of brushed steel.

Ather says to Andrew, "You'll see that the statement is submitted?"
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth nods.

Ather says to Andrew, "Thanks for your time."
nod andrew 'Thank you for attending.
You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth. "Thank you for attending."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm glad there is a statement finally
going forward after a week has elapsed."
"Last thing I say on this topic, no one wsaid Lily, come back." Voice of the
Corps Kim Saunders sighs. "Dear heavens, things are falling apart and someone
does not know we may need help here? And then complains about our disunity. That
makes me sad."
Andrew looks disbelievingly at Lily, then nods to Ather and then Kim. "Likewise.
Until next time, y'all."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders smiles at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth. "Thank
you for attending ans assisting us."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth briefly opens the door to leave.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth walks south.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Well had I done a kneejerk thing like
Annie did when defense were sent to Andy's and I came back and you all had a
different story?"
Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I still move at the
temporary revocation! Please consider it."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders sighs.
Ather says to Lily, "Look. As Kim said, you're the last person to complain about
disunity in this alliance. You are selfish, and obviously only out for your own
interests."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Sorry Ather, this
woman makes me so... mad."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders points at Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well you all disturb me. You didn't seem
to have a problem with anything."
Ather says to Lily, "If you wanted a statement released sooner, then you
should've said to yourself, "Oh, hmm, we should get ahead of this, and release a
statement!""
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Uneil Melinda sent you the letter."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Until."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Even if -we- didn't ask you to come back, don't you have
enough brai npower to think "Hmm, there is shit going on, maybe I should come
back to see if I can't get ahead of it!?""
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yes I did come back for that reason."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "You came back when the expedition was virtually concluded.
You came back because everyone else came back."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "However I was very confused about who I
was answering to. Still I didn't choose to remain out there."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "If they had stayed out another week, you would've stayed out
for another week as well."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No it wasn't."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We were going to go artifacting and I
asked that we didn't do so."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Perhaps, perhaps not. The point is, you should've known that
there was shit going on, and you should've come back at the first sign of it.
Even if it wasn't us who sent the message, why wouldn't you have seen "Oh shit,
there is some unrest going on back home, maybe I should return to handle it!""
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It wasn't my ship as well but I would
have come back."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "It would not have been logistically difficult for Johann to
let you use the rescue pod to return home. All you had to say was "Johann, I
need to go home, my alliance needs me." If he had refused, that would have put
you in a considerably better light than you're in right now."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I can't answer for Shule but I believe
he would have come back with me even if Johann had wanted to continue onto Sea
of Fears."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Shule is not the person called into questio here. Shule was
not the voice of this alliance."
'After Melinda left, she did consider taking her sightseer back.
You say, "After Melinda left, she did consider taking her sightseer back."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I certainly did."
Ather says to you in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "-consider- is not the same as -doing-."
Kim says to Lily, "I did not speak with melinda, did not get any letters, until
some time after I posted the first notices on the communicator and board, when I
asked you, along with everyone else, to help set up this meeting. Wanting to do
the statement was the first topic on the meeting agenda."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Consideration is irrelevant if it wasn't acted upon. She
could've just undocked the sightseer, used its rescue pod to return home, then
someone else could've walked to and redocked to it."
Ather says to Lily, "For fuck's sake, admit you were wrong, and apologize for
it. All you're doing right now is showing how completely dense, selfish and
conceded you are."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I delayed less than a day and would have
delayed even less but I didn't feel that I had the authority to turn Johann's
ship around. We did come back early though and had I still had the position,
this statement you all have issued would not be so delayed. Taking this long is
rediculous."
Ather Jammoa asks in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Oh, so now it's our fault because we issued the recall?"
Ather Jammoa asks in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "All we knew is you refused to come back. What else could we
have done?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah according to Melinda but she never
allowed me to get much of an opportunity to even make a statement."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "She spun it the way she wanted which is
unfortunate."
Ather slams both palms onto the table and shouts angrily, his robotic voice
becoming distorted by his synthesizer, "then you should have fucking made the
statement yourself by undocking the sightseer, taking its fucking rescue pod
home, and letting someone else redock it onto the stupid platform!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I do regret it that I felt embarrassed
to ask johann not to go onto Tom town to get his upgrade. That is wrong as I
should have insisted we turn back from Andy's after we had finished charging his
ship or taken my Sightseer."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And this comes
from the person who has waited 3 terms and still did not set up a meeting about
the medical creche proposal she herself came up with. Who needed more than what,
a few minutes, a few hours, to decide that hey, actually I might want to go home
and see what help is needed. Who did not respond to a request for a meeting for
2 days, and then said we should skip the meeting and the voice should just
handle the statement. And then who refused to come to a meeting and came 2 hours
late, after the statement was discussed, written and signed."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "You want people to stp treating you like an inept twit, then
stop acting like one."
Lily says to Kim, "You are forgetting a lot of things. I asked for input form
you all. I evensuggested meeting times and none of you responded."
glance
You glance around at your surroundings.
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Why didn't you actually just set up a meeting, like Kim did
by taking the initiative? If no one had shown up, then you could've been able to
stand on your soapbox and ranted to your heart's content."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok."
Kim says to Lily, ""hey Melinda, thank you for coming to tell me about the news,
that is distressing, I want to go home, and see if I can help, but need to see
how I can do it. I don't know, something like that?"
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Few people responded to Kim, either. Because I personally,
didn't care when the meeting was going to be, so I figured, eh, whenever, I can
make it. You should've done the same. She set up the meeting with pretty much
input from just one, -one- person. As well as a snob who said she wasn't going
to come to the meeting because she was oh so vilified."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I at least gave you all an
opportunity to express what you wanted and you didn't."
Ather Jammoa asks in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "Well, we didn't have a meeting to express what we all
wanted, now could we?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It seemed nobody wanted a meeting."
Ather Jammoa says in a gravelly and synthesized, but still somewhat New
Phoenecian accent, "We had a meeting today though, we expressed what we wanted,
and the medical creche thing was decided in a matter of less than five minutes.
Had you been here, you would have probably een astonished."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So I was trying to find some medium you
were comfortabl with."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Good for you."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'm glad you got together on something."

You say, "I wasn't at the meeting between her and Melinda."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "The thing that
Lily does not seem to get is this."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "If she had just
said to Melinda that she wanted to go home but needed to discuss with Johann
because this was his trip, his ship, Melinda would have waited or helped her, it
is what Melinda went there for to begin with."

she did regret not coming home immediately.
"I understand and I'm sure she would have." You nod. "However, she did just say
that she did regret not coming home immediately."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "By the way, I
never accused her of refusing to come back when we requested her to. I am not
sure where that part comes from because, I never requested anything. Melinda was
long gone before I had a chance to request anything."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I think it was an
effort from Melinda and Akemi to give us a hand."

Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has
been posted under "AEU."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, but then
why the board post, complaining about how melinda misrepresented her. When all
Melinda said was that Lily was not coming back because she felt there was
nothing she could do, and because we did not specificly ask her? At that point,
all she really had to do was say sorry guys, I made a mistake, I misjudged the
situation and should have come home sooner. It would have been over."

her, to finally admit that. Why does this need to escalate first?"

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are

stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
