00:07:23 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:07:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:07:51 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:07:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:07:53 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

00:07:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:07:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:07:59 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Wow, shall we read into this more?"

00:08:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Huh. That makes it sound kinda...dirty."

00:08:02 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 501" has launched from New Earth.

00:08:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:08:09 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Well, there we go. That gives a different meaning to the word penitration."

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

00:11:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:11:50 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:11:55 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Certainly would make things spicy."

00:11:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:12:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:12:08 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

00:12:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:12:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:12:11 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:12:14 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:12:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:12:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, I know...I read the headline. I was tryin to figure out where they got that from."

00:12:43 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "That also sounds dirty given our previous conversation."

00:12:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:12:47 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh."

00:14:54 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Let's count on 22:30 then meet at Earth."

00:15:05 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:15:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

01:25:49 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:25:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:25:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:25:53 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

01:26:23 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 501! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

01:26:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:26:31 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:26:32 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a standard signal: "Where are you bound?"

01:26:32 Via general sector communication, Registered Merchant 501 transmits a text-based transmission: "Trading run. On my way to New Earth."

01:26:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Justen Moon. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:26:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:26:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:26:50 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:27:31 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

01:27:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

01:40:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid Belt Management Station.

01:40:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:41:01 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I still fall back on old habbits!"

01:41:07 You say, "Yeah, me too."

01:41:10 Lily Kaise grins.

01:41:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:41:28 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

01:41:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

01:41:34 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

01:41:41 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:41:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:41:44 Lily Kaise glides out.

01:41:45 I don't understand that.

01:41:45 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:42:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Heh 77.71 belt managent. I love those numbers! and good evening everyone."

01:43:04 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:43:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire cheers.

01:43:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Good evening."

01:43:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Good evening Lily."

01:43:17 You chuckle.

01:43:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "HiHI."

01:43:23 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

01:43:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Or morning, or whatever time it is in your personal time bubble."

01:43:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Lily."

01:43:37 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

01:43:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah, something like that!"

01:43:39 You grin.

01:43:47 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

01:43:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey there."

01:44:05 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Bryan, when did you want to do missions?"

01:44:18 [General Communication] Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah transmits, "2 and a half days ago."

01:44:27 [General Communication] Pilot Alko Delovega transmits, "Correct."

01:44:37 Lily Kaise says, "Ok I want to go assemble the scooping station before we get busy or might get busy after midning."

01:44:43 Lily Kaise says, "Midnight."

01:44:44 You nod.

01:44:45 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

01:44:47 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

01:44:48 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "In 16 minutes."

01:44:52 [General Communication] Bryan Stout chuckles.

01:44:52 A launch trajectory is located.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:44:56 [General Communication] Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah laughs.

01:44:57 You chuckle.

01:44:59 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Whenever we get enough."

01:45:00 Lily Kaise chuckles.

01:45:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:45:05 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:45:05 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:45:06 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

01:45:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:45:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:45:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:45:12 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:45:12 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "You said you needed a bit right?"

01:45:13 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

01:45:13 The computer reports that the two-person Accord corvette "Peacekeeper Task Force Epsilon 0" has jumped out of the sector.

01:45:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:45:14 The computer reports that the two-person Accord corvette "Peacekeeper Task Force Epsilon 7" has jumped out of the sector.

01:45:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:45:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:45:17 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:45:18 Lily Kaise says, "Yup I forgot again."

01:45:18 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

01:45:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:45:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:45:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:45:22 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:45:23 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

01:45:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:45:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:45:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:45:27 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:45:30 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

01:45:32 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:45:33 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, 0030 would work better for me."

01:45:37 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

01:45:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:45:42 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "That's fine."

01:46:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:46:14 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:46:19 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

01:46:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:46:21 Lily Kaise says, "Same here whatever it is."

01:46:24 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:46:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:46:33 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

01:46:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:46:35 Lily Kaise glides out.

01:46:37 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:47:25 You scramble to your feet.

01:47:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:04:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:04:33 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:04:46 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:04:51 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

02:04:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:04:57 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:04:58 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:04:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm off to participate in missions. Maybe afterwords though."

02:05:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:05:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:05:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:05:14 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

02:06:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:06:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:06:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:06:40 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:06:40 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:06:41 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:06:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:07:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "When there's someone in the Industrial Whip position, they often give us little updates and such."

02:07:10 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

02:07:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I may have not heard it so I'll add too that your starship upgrades require less points as well."

02:07:14 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:07:24 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:10:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:10:46 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.

02:12:25 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 293,085.98 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.

02:16:41 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:16:43 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:16:44 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:16:56 Your communicator reports that...

02:16:56 
At least one recently active pilot is relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

02:17:19 Lily Kaise says, "Wow tlad urindustry isn't at 6666."

Lily Kaise laughs.

02:18:56 Lily Kaise asks, "So I will check when the scoop goes offline. If it's closer to 330, I shouldn't stay up that late so would you be able to go deploy it Love?"

02:19:05 You say, "Absolutely."

02:19:07 You grin.

02:19:11 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:19:15 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:19:24 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Thanks so much!"

02:19:33 You smile. "No problem."

02:19:49 Your communicator reports that...

02:19:50 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

02:20:02 Lily Kaise says, "Wish we could just go put the new one out but we can't until the old one goes offline."

02:20:09 You nod. "Yeah."

02:20:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:21:03 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami
02:21:03 c felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

02:22:32 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:22:34 Your communicator reports that...

02:22:34 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

02:23:28 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Missions in 7 minutes."

02:23:40 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll be there."

02:23:49 You say to Lily, "Ready to head to the lounge?"

02:23:51 You're already standing.

02:23:54 Lily Kaise is already in your group.

02:24:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So are we going to attack that one station we cleared of bari again to lead off this conquest period?"

02:24:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that what Vernos was just talking about?"

02:24:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that wher you meant, Vernos?"

02:24:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Maybe, and yeah that's what he was talking about."

02:24:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:24:29 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise followed you.

02:24:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool."

02:24:37 You exit the ship.

02:24:37 [Manhattan Spaceport; Garage]
You can go up.
Lily Kaise followed you.

02:24:40 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

02:24:40 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a salt lick, and Muffin the little orange CatBot here.
Rogue Romano is dozing on a comfortable wooden chair.
You can go out.
Lily Kaise followed you.

02:24:46 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

02:24:53 Evenia Callseah just arrived.

02:24:53 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.

02:24:55 Bryan Stout just arrived.

02:24:57 You wave.

02:24:59 You hug Evenia Callseah.

02:25:09 Evenia Callseah hugs you.

02:25:14 Lily Kaise waves to Evenia Callseah.

02:25:17 Lily Kaise hugs Evenia Callseah.

02:25:20 Evenia Callseah waves to Lily Kaise.

02:25:22 Evenia Callseah hugs Lily Kaise.

02:25:28 Bryan Stout asks, "Who is in for missions?"

02:25:33 You say, "Me."

02:25:34 Evenia Callseah says, "Me."

02:25:36 Bryan Stout takes control of your group.

02:25:36 You say, "Myself."

02:25:37 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Me!"

02:25:38 Bryan Stout holds Evenia Callseah's hand, taking her into his group.

02:25:40 You say, "And I."

02:25:43 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:25:54 Bryan Stout glances down at his titanium watch with an oval-shaped face momentarily.

02:26:03 Bryan Stout says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Jacob, you and rogue in for missions?"

02:26:07 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Missions in 5 mintues."

02:26:08 Jacob Smitt just arrived.

02:26:08 Rogue rubs her eyes and yawns.
A personal hoverpallet floats in behind Jacob Smitt.

02:26:17 Lily Kaise waves to Jacob Smitt.

02:26:18 Bryan Stout holds Jacob Smitt's hand, taking him into his group.

02:26:19 Jacob Smitt waves.

02:26:22 Rogue Romano stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

02:26:24 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Minutes."

02:26:24 Jacob Smitt says, "Wait."

02:26:27 Jacob Smitt just went into the stairway to the garage.

02:26:28 Rogue Romano nods to Bryan Stout.

02:26:28 Bryan Stout holds Rogue Romano's hand, taking her into his group.

02:26:31 Bryan Stout asks, "Yes?"

02:26:39 Jacob Smitt just arrived.

02:26:42 Jacob Smitt says, "Sorry about that."

02:26:43 Rogue Romano says, "Yes I'm goin'."

02:26:44 Bryan Stout speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:26:44 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "2 spots."

02:26:45 Jacob Smitt says, "Alright ready."

02:26:47 Bryan Stout holds Jacob Smitt's hand, taking him into his group.

02:26:58 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "On my way."

02:26:58 Jacob Smitt says, "Had to ditch that hoverpallet."

02:27:08 Bryan Stout nods to Jacob Smitt.

02:27:09 Jacob Smitt runs his fingers back and forth through Rogue Romano's hair.

02:27:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Missions?"

02:27:10 Bryan Stout speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:27:11 Evenia Callseah leans on Vartija the arachnoid security robot.

02:27:11 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "One more?"

02:27:11 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 389" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

02:27:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll do a mission."

02:27:16 Rogue Romano smiles at Jacob Smitt.

02:27:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where should I meed you?"

02:27:22 Jacob Smitt smiles at Rogue Romano.

02:27:26 You say, "Full."

02:27:29 You say, "Got one."

02:27:32 You say, "Constantine."

02:27:33 Bryan Stout says, "Woo."

02:27:36 Bryan Stout says, "Excellent."

02:27:42 Bryan says to Jacob, "Put your flying gloves on."

02:27:43 Rogue Romano nods and nods.

02:27:43 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We're doing two combat Missions."

02:27:45 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And full."

02:27:45 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the vostok-class capsule "Blurr".

02:27:47 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

02:27:51 Evenia says to Bryan, "My usual?"

02:27:55 Jacob Smitt says, "Yes sir."

02:28:03 Bryan says to Evenia, "You and Lily can discuss that."

02:28:05 Bryan Stout chuckles.

02:28:20 Hakeem Oiadip just arrived.

02:28:23 Bryan Stout holds Hakeem Oiadip's hand, taking him into his group.

02:28:23 Evenia says to Lily, "I like usually always engineer for Bryan on missions."

02:28:24 Hakeem Oiadip waves.

02:28:26 You say, "Bryan will fly and all the rest of us will engineer."

02:28:30 Lily Kaise says, "Well I will make for a pretty terrible horrible gunner at the moment."

02:28:38 Evenia Callseah smiles. "Um, so would I."

02:28:41 Bryan Stout says, "Tell you what."

02:28:49 Rogue Romano says, "If we all engineer. I'll use restores."

02:28:52 Bryan says to Lily, "Engineer on the first round."

02:28:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Constantine, come to Old Earth."

02:28:57 Bryan says to Evenia, "Engineer on the second."

02:29:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "In the lounge."

02:29:05 You say, "That sounds fair."

02:29:06 Bryan Stout asks, "Does that work?"

02:29:06 Lily says to Evenia, "You do one an'hey I was about to suggest that."

02:29:08 Evenia says to Bryan, "If I can have either weapons one or 2, lily can engineer."

02:29:11 Lily Kaise grins.

02:29:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ok, be there shortly."

02:29:14 You grin.

02:29:18 Bryan says to Evenia, "Take room 2."

02:29:25 Evenia Callseah nods to Bryan Stout.

02:29:31 Bryan Stout says, "We might have to make a quick stop."

02:29:36 Bryan Stout says, "I forget what I have on it."

02:29:38 You ask, "A pit stop?"

02:29:39 Lily says to Evenia, "I don't mind trading off though."

02:29:42 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:29:43 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:29:46 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

02:29:53 "We'll do that then." Evenia Callseah nods to Lily Kaise. "You engineer the first, I'll do the second."

02:29:59 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Cool!"

02:30:00 Rogue Romano says, "I'm fine with pit stops."

02:30:02 You say, "I want the third."

02:30:06 Evenia Callseah pokes you in the ribs!

02:30:06 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:30:12 You grin.

02:30:22 Evenia Callseah says, "Well hopefully it's got weapons on it. It'll really be short missions otherwise."

02:30:28 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-71".

02:30:28 Bryan Stout says, "Of course it does."

02:30:28 You chuckle.

02:30:30 Lily says to you, "It's fine as long as you'll continnue to gun with your toes!"

02:30:30 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-56".

02:30:34 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:30:34 Bryan Stout says, "It will be outfitted with minicannons."

02:30:41 Evenia Callseah beams at Bryan Stout.

02:30:56 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person cargo hauler "Pack Rat".

02:31:02 Evenia Callseah gestures vaguely at a tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with "Fire All The Damn Minis!" written in gold letters.

02:31:08 Constantine Stone just arrived.

02:31:08 You grin at Evenia Callseah.
Evenia Callseah says, "It's all about the minis."

02:31:10 Constantine Stone waves.

02:31:12 Bryan points at Constantine. "A rat."

02:31:13 Lily Kaise waves to Constantine Stone.

02:31:14 You wave to Constantine Stone.

02:31:16 Constantine Stone smiles.

02:31:18 Bryan Stout laughs.

02:31:20 Hakeem Oiadip waves to Constantine Stone.

02:31:20 Bryan Stout holds Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into his group.

02:31:23 You chuckle.

02:31:26 Evenia Callseah grins at Constantine Stone.

02:31:26 Lily Kaise grins.

02:31:28 Constantine Stone closes a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

02:31:30 Constantine Stone opens a sturdy dark green canvas backpack for a moment.

02:31:30 Constantine Stone puts a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" in a sturdy dark green canvas backpack.

02:31:37 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Torpedos are better!"

02:31:41 Bryan Stout asks, "Ready?"

02:31:42 Lily Kaise squints.

02:31:43 You nod.

02:31:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:31:44 Evenia Callseah absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:31:44 Constantine Stone nods.

02:31:45 Rogue Romano nods.

02:31:47 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:31:51 You follow Bryan Stout out.

02:31:52 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-71", the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-56", and the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 389" are landed here.

02:31:56 [Starship "It's A Wolf Thing"; Control Lobby]

02:31:56 You can go north, northeast, northwest, and down.

02:31:56 Bryan Stout ambles in from the north followed by Lily Kaise, Evenia Callseah, Rogue Romano, Jacob Smitt, Hakeem Oiadip, and Constantine Stone.

02:31:56 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.
Muffin the little orange CatBot trots happily in after Rogue Romano with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:31:59 Hakeem Oiadip slinks down.

02:32:01 Bryan Stout nods to you.

02:32:04 Hakeem Oiadip slinks in from below.

02:32:07 Bryan Stout holds Hakeem Oiadip's hand, taking him into his group.

02:32:08 Constantine Stone walks northwest.

02:32:09 Hakeem Oiadip nods.

02:32:11 Bryan Stout says, "No no."

02:32:13 Bryan Stout disbands his group.

02:32:14 Bryan Stout ambles north.

02:32:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:32:16 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Sorry."

02:32:19 Bryan Stout ambles in from the north.

02:32:19 Bryan Stout ambles down.

02:32:19 [Starship "It's A Wolf Thing"; Control Lobby]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see Vartija the arachnoid security robot and Muffin the little orange CatBot here.
Lily Kaise, Evenia Callseah, Rogue Romano, Jacob Smitt, and Hakeem Oiadip are standing here.
You can go north, northeast, northwest, and down.

02:32:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:32:29 Bryan Stout ambles in from below.

02:32:30 Bryan Stout ambles north.

02:32:30 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Northeast."

02:32:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:32:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:32:39 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:32:39 Jacob Smitt stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

02:32:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:32:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:32:49 Bryan Stout's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Someone grab everyone in the control lobby."

02:32:52 Lily Kaise says to Hakeem, "When we do missions, we'll need to be grouped for the assignment."

02:32:53 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok."

02:32:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:32:54 You hear a solid thunk sound as an ammunition storage box is expelled from the storage room.

02:32:57 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

02:32:59 Hold who?

02:33:00 Hakeem Oiadip nods to Lily Kaise.

02:33:02 two of a portion of a RATS constructor seems to have no desire to join your group.

02:33:04 Hakeem Oiadip says, "I remembered late."

02:33:04 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:33:06 You hold Hakeem Oiadip's hand, taking him into your group.

[Starship "It's A Wolf Thing"; Weapons Room One]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays.

03:45:47 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:45:56 You say, "And Starseekers and keep Vernos."

03:46:05 Lily Kaise says, "That's my sentaments."

03:46:07 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:46:10 You laugh.

03:46:30 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't have any intentions of inviting us and am glad he hasn't asked."

03:46:36 You nod.

03:46:38 You say, "Me too."

03:46:53 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:46:57 You say, "He went on another nest with me earlier."

03:47:02 You say, "Constantine did."

03:47:07 Lily Kaise says, "So whenever you have the time to speak with Constantine, please express what we've just discussed."

03:47:15 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I will."

03:47:35 You say, "I always see him doing something."

03:47:46 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

03:48:14 You say, "And he asks inteligent questions."

03:48:20 You say, "Intelligent."

03:48:45 [General Communication] Keyonna Bradley transmits, "Sawyer, are you staying with us, I'm asking because I'm letting the desk know who's with me."

03:48:53 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:48:55 Lily Kaise says, "He sure does and he would be an excellent candidate for exploration if he decides he likes it."

03:49:00 You nod.

03:49:33 You say, "He did really well on the nest earlier today, even against mice."

03:49:47 Lily Kaise says, "I wish we would see this Ryo individual a bit more. He or she seems to be rather quiet."

03:49:58 You say, "He's actually pretty cool too."

03:50:09 Lily Kaise says, "Oh wow then get to know what he's like."

03:51:04 Lily Kaise says, "Additional."

03:51:07 You say, "That's fine."

03:51:29 Lily Kaise says, "If we were to grow to about ten, I would appoint one more."

03:51:36 You say, "That makes sense."

03:51:40 Lily Kaise nods.

03:51:53 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

03:52:08 Lily Kaise says, "As it's not tht I want both of us to usurp the power. I just don't think we have the need currently."

03:52:08 [General Communication] Sawyer Reid transmits, "Huh? No, I have my own place, but thank you."

03:52:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:52:21 You nod and smile.

03:53:23 I don't understand that.

03:53:26 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:54:33 You grin at Lily Kaise. "I'm glad we agree on who we'd like to invite to the org."

03:54:38 You smile.

03:56:18 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah me too. Well we both seem to observe others fairly equally. You know me, I don't like butt kissers."

03:56:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:58:00 You laugh.

03:59:03 Your communicator reports that...

03:59:03 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

03:59:47 You say, "Oh."

03:59:53 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

03:59:54 You say, "I need to talk to you about something."

04:00:02 Lily Kaise asks, "What's up?"

04:00:28 You ask, "Well, when were were out at 273. Do you remember that there was a cease fire agreement with the pirates?"

04:00:36 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah..."

04:01:05 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah we did engage but they also were the aggressors."

04:01:11 You say, "Well, after the mutality pilots left, I was on a crew that engaged pirates. Therefore, Mr. Kelsey is claiming we broke the cease fire agreement."

04:01:20 Lily Kaise says, "That's bullshit."

04:01:22 You say, "Mutuality pilots, that is."

04:01:25 You nod.

04:01:26 You say, "I know."

04:01:52 Lily Kaise asks, "As I say they were the aggressors right? Didn't they fire on you all first?"

04:02:13 You say, "And truthfully, the cease fire never ame through government channels. And I don't know as I was in the weapon room. I have no idea if they locked on us first."

04:02:23 Lily Kaise nods.

04:02:33 Lily Kaise asks, "You know what I think?"

04:02:39 You ask, "What?"

04:02:57 Lily Kaise says, "I think Kelsi is trying to start something and his boys were the troublemakers."

04:03:09 You say, "Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me."

04:03:15 Lily Kaise says, "Me either."

04:03:26 You say, "They were in the sector with all of the temp stations."

04:03:39 Lily Kaise asks, "What does Ather have to say about all this?"

04:03:39 You say, "When we engaged them."

04:03:47 You say, "I don't know."

04:03:54 Lily Kaise nods.

04:03:54 You say, "I've just talked to Kim about it."

04:04:19 Lily Kaise says, "Well grill her about what Ather has to say. She is always eager to point fingers and blame."

04:04:25 You say, "I will."

04:05:16 Lily Kaise asks, "Yeah and those were Allied Pirates right not Lamda?"

04:06:11 You nod. "They were."

04:06:15 Lily Kaise says, "I guess Kelsi is bored heh."

04:06:44 You ask, "But nobody can blame the gunners. I mean, what do you do when the ship goes on red and a target is tracked?"

04:06:50 Lily Kaise says, "Right."

04:07:08 You say, "And yeah, he probably is bored."

04:07:23 Lily Kaise says, "I guess it should have been the captain's responsibility to say nope we're not going to fire on theseguys."

04:07:27 You nod.

04:07:30 Lily Kaise says, "These guys."

04:07:36 You say, "But maybe they locked on us."

04:07:59 You say, "That's a question for Damien Goss."

04:08:11 Lily Kaise asks, "Yeah that ismy thought which is why I said hey if they were the aggressors, then all bets are off and who broke the ceas fire?"

04:08:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

04:08:17 You say, "Exactly."

04:08:41 Lily Kaise says, "I would experess it exactly that way to Kim."

04:08:51 Lily Kaise says, "Express."

04:08:53 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender.

04:09:02 You say, "I wnod."

04:09:03 You nod.

04:10:53 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

04:11:53 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

04:13:09 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:14:53 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:14:54 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."

04:15:00 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Hiiii!"

04:15:02 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yo."

04:15:09 [General Communication] Keyonna Bradley transmits, "Hey there Mendy."

04:15:12 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi Mel."

04:15:16 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:15:20 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Um, Melinda."

04:15:22 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:15:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You guys in the vents yet? I think I can hear you guys banging around in there."

04:15:50 Lily Kaise says, "Be right back. Need to check the remaining time on the scoop."

04:15:52 [General Communication] Keyonna Bradley transmits, "I'm sorry Melinda, I promise I'll get it right soon."

04:15:54 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:15:55 You nod.

04:15:58 Lily Kaise glides out.

04:15:58 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

04:15:59 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:16:07 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh somebody is at NQ."

04:16:24 Your communicator reports that...

04:16:24 
At least four recently active pilots are relaxing at Nouveau Quebec; Chic Resto Pop.

04:16:38 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "How can you know we are at nq?"

04:16:41 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Actually, looks like somebodies are there."

04:16:48 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Wow!"

04:16:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok has 57 minutes plus another hour of emergency power."

04:16:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

04:17:00 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I didn't know you were."

04:17:20 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Oddness."

04:17:23 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Because Melinda knows all."

04:17:33 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Weeha and so do you?"

04:17:34 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Not quite."

04:17:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Will you be able to stay awake that long? If not, just wait until you wake up. We'll survive if there's a gap of a few hours."

04:17:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I think so."

04:18:20 Your communicator reports that...

04:18:20 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

04:18:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok also do you have keys to the two libs ships?"

04:18:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Umm, let me check. Which ones are they?"

04:18:51 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Did you guys take the bus?"

04:18:58 [General Communication] Alexandra Rose transmits, "Yep."

04:19:00 [General Communication] Keyonna Bradley transmits, "Yes."

04:19:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Libertarians spare parts and libertarians transport alpha or something like that."

04:19:12 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Nice."

04:19:14 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Indeed."

04:19:31 The sensors currently do not have power.

Note: Not all spaceports possess the starship locator function.

04:20:16 I don't understand that.

04:20:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Looks like I do not."

04:20:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok I'll see what I have."

04:20:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

04:21:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Because the Salvage Processor in 777 will be going offline in about 21 hours so if you would load a fission Breeder Reactor onto one of those, then evenia can have our part."

04:22:17 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] Frontier Cluster has gone on alert!

04:22:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Can someone go up there and make sure I hid liberation?"

04:22:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If I didn't, board her. Crack her hatch."

04:22:54 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

04:23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Going."

04:23:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Already here in my fighter anyways, just won't be able to land till you guys are done."

04:23:36 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:23:38 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

04:23:43 Lily Kaise gives you a "Libertarians Spare Parts" key.

04:23:47 Lily Kaise gives you a "Libertarians Station Transport Alpha" key.

04:24:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Is it up there?"

04:24:22 Lily Kaise opens a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

04:24:24 Lily Kaise removes a "Libertarians Spare Parts" key from a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

04:24:29 Lily Kaise slides a "Libertarians Spare Parts" key onto an enameled purple space cat keyring.

04:24:41 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:24:53 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

04:24:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Damnit why were my weapons powered down."

04:24:56 You say, "Thanks."

04:25:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Is liberation up there?"

04:25:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'll check."

04:25:25 I see no "keychian" here.

04:25:29 You slide a "Libertarians Spare Parts" key onto a keychain.

04:25:32 You slide a "Libertarians Station Transport Alpha" key onto a keychain.

04:25:35 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:25:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:25:38 You say, "Hang on."

04:25:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:25:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:25:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:25:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Checking."

04:26:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:26:04 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

04:26:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:26:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:26:11 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

04:26:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:26:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:26:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:26:17 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:26:18 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

04:26:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:26:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:26:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:26:22 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:26:23 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

04:26:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was reasonably sure I hid it, but it doesn't hurt to make sure."

04:26:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:26:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:26:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:26:27 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

04:26:29 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

04:27:33 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Liberation.

04:27:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:27:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Weird."

04:27:42 Lily Kaise says, "Shule."

04:27:45 You nod.

04:27:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Maybe after I scanned I didn't hit the hiding thing."

04:27:56 You say, "He wants us to crack the hatch an get it to safety."

04:27:58 Lily Kaise says, "We won't go red but I don't want this stationery in here."

04:27:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:28:03 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Stuff Of Legends" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

04:28:04 Lily Kaise says, "I have too much invested."

04:28:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:28:13 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:28:14 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:28:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:28:18 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:28:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:28:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:28:20 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:28:21 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:28:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:28:46 Lily Kaise joins your group.

04:28:54 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

04:28:54 You say to Lily, "Do you have a hatch cracker?"

04:29:08 Lily Kaise removes a hatch repair kit from a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

04:29:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:29:17 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:29:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:29:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:29:27 Lily Kaise removes a hatch cracker from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

04:29:30 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

04:29:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:29:37 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:29:39 You say, "We're going to go in my clipper. Crack the hatch and get his ship to safety."

04:29:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:29:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:29:46 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:29:49 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise followed you.

04:29:51 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah i'll crack it and bring it back."

04:29:53 You exit the ship.

04:29:53 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

Lily Kaise followed you.

04:29:59 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:29:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:30:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:30:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:30:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:30:06 Lily Kaise puts a hatch repair kit in a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

04:30:08 The ship is already moving.

04:30:14 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

04:30:14 The ship is already moving.

04:30:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:30:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:30:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:30:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

04:30:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:30:20 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:30:20 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Xi-2" has jumped into the sector.

04:30:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:30:23 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Xi-2! Welcome to home space!"

04:30:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:30:23 Lily Kaise removes spacesuit components from a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side and quickly dons them.

04:30:24 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

04:30:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:30:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

04:30:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

04:30:30 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:30:30 Lily Kaise stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

04:30:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:30:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:30:33 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

04:30:34 You pull Lily Kaise to her feet.

04:42:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah they're gone."

04:42:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Now that is wow."

04:42:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Frontier cluster is clear."

04:42:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok I'll come back in or do you want me to wait Ather?"

04:42:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I jumped back in to double check."

04:42:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

04:42:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We should be near extraction point. Stand by."

04:42:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They jumped in earlier today too, but then immediately jumped out once some of us showed up and the navy. No shots were fired that I saw."

04:43:24 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

04:43:25 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:43:26 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:43:26 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:43:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:43:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:43:38 The starship is already moving.

04:43:41 The starship is already moving.

04:43:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:43:42 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?

04:43:42 [Enter `yes' or `no']

04:43:44 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

04:43:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Go ahead nad dock for a while. There still seems to be a bit of vent left. This is fairly large."

04:43:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:43:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:43:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That was the first time, since I've been a pilot, tht I cracked a hatch!"

04:43:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:44:03 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:44:03 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:44:04 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:44:04 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:44:04 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

04:44:04 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The four-person mule "Liberation" and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

04:44:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Chudkle."

04:44:10 Board what?

04:44:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:44:14 You key in a transport of Firestorm to your location.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

04:44:18 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] Beacon B-29 has gone on alert!

04:44:23 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

04:44:26 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:44:26 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:44:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh dear."

04:44:27 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:44:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:44:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:44:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Funny enough, I think it was the hatch getting cracked that actually got the navy to launch."

04:44:35 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

04:44:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:44:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Checking B-29."

04:44:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah but you're back on alert now."

04:44:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, they eventually scramble defenders. They don't care much about cracked hatches in beta-4."

04:44:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay."

04:44:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Beacon B-29. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:44:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:44:57 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

04:45:00 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:45:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:45:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:45:04 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:45:05 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

05:12:16 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

05:12:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

05:58:39 The computer reports that the four-person light carrier "On The Wings Of A Hummingbird" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

05:58:43 The computer reports that the four-person light carrier "On The Wings Of A Hummingbird" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

05:58:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:58:45 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

05:58:49 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

05:58:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

05:58:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:59:02 You pull a large lever towards you.

05:59:02 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

05:59:03 You scramble to your feet.

You can go northeast, southeast, and up.

05:59:04 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

05:59:13 the four-person space constructor "Herding Cats"

05:59:13 You see a light cruiser here.
"Herding Cats" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AC-2X" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a smooth dome, a series of delicate antennae encased in a transparisteel dome, and a small shiny black circular section on the forward end.

05:59:14 The four-person light carrier "On The Wings Of A Hummingbird" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

05:59:22 Evenia Callseah exits from the four-person light carrier "On The Wings Of A Hummingbird".

05:59:22 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.

05:59:28 I don't understand that.

05:59:31 You hold Evenia Callseah's hand, taking her into your group.

05:59:34 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Airlock]

05:59:34 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Evenia Callseah followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.

05:59:36 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

05:59:36 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go south and out.
Evenia Callseah followed you.
Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.

05:59:42 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

05:59:44 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

05:59:48 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

05:59:51 You grin.

06:00:02 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

06:00:07 Evenia Callseah says, "Ah, you could have just said aboard this. Lily gave me a key to this ages ago."

06:00:11 Evenia Callseah nuzzles your neck softly.

06:00:14 You say, "Oh, I didn't know."

06:00:16 You laugh.

06:00:25 Evenia Callseah sits down on your lap.

06:00:33 You kiss Evenia Callseah softly on the neck.

06:00:41 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. I can't launch it, but this way I can see if she's got parts hiding somewhere I might need."

06:00:46 You laugh.

06:00:47 You grin.

06:01:04 You squeeze Evenia Callseah affectionately.

06:01:10 Evenia Callseah squeezes you affectionately.

06:01:24 You gently caress Evenia Callseah's back.

06:01:32 Evenia Callseah says, "You know what's hard? When she hugs me and I gotta hug back, knowing how bad we are."

06:01:38 You nod.

06:02:05 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

06:02:14 Evenia Callseah says, "But the funny thing? I don't feel bad. Maybe I'm fucked up."

06:02:19 You chuckle.

06:02:21 Evenia snuggles her head on your shoulder.

06:02:38 Shule turns his head to kiss your face and neck.

06:02:53 Evenia Callseah smiles at you.

06:03:35 You kiss Evenia Callseah on the lips.

06:03:42 Evenia Callseah kisses you on the lips.

06:04:21 You grin at Evenia Callseah. "Maybe we can do some beacons some time and you can naked engineer for me."

06:04:29 Evenia Callseah grins at you. "I would so do that."

06:04:45 You grin.

06:04:54 Evenia Callseah says, "But only if you flew naked."

06:05:01 You say, "Of course."

06:05:08 Evenia Callseah says, "Mmm."

06:05:17 Evenia Callseah says, "Talk about hard to concentrate."

06:05:23 You grin.

06:06:06 You kiss Evenia Callseah softly on the neck.

06:06:15 Evenia Callseah softly licks your lips.

06:06:33 Shule sucks your tongue into his mouth briefly and sucks on it.

06:06:55 Evenia Callseah grins at you. "I knew you'd do that."

06:06:59 You grin.

06:07:52 Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her close-cropped, bristly hair is glossy obsidian and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces her right upper ear, a thick gold ring pierces her right lower lip, and a thick gold ring pierces her left lower lip.
 She is wearing a finely crafted choker of polished rounded squares of blue and gold dichroic glass, a tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with "Fire All The Damn Minis!" written in gold letters, a pair of blood-spattered black leather forearm bands with nine rows of two-inch-long rusty steel spiked studs, a glittering gold chain of tiny linked daggers around her waist, a pair 
06:07:52 of black low rise denim jeans, and a pair of black leather boots with medium heels and steel buckles up the sides. She is also wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side, a teal battle hummingbird stamp, and a Tardick lizard named Zeus perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both elbows, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

06:08:31 Shule slips his hand under your t-shirt and caresses you.

06:08:31 Evenia snuggles against you.

06:08:35 Evenia Callseah grins.

06:09:18 Evenia Callseah leans close to you and kisses you softly on the chest.

06:09:38 Shule lifts up your  t-shirt and kisses your chest.

06:10:28 Evenia softly runs her fingers through your hair.

06:10:36 Evenia Callseah says, "I really love that hair."

06:10:42 You say, "Thanks."

06:10:43 You grin.

06:10:54 Evenia Callseah grins at you.

06:11:22 Shule runs his hand around to the front and caresses you under your t-shirt.

06:12:25 You gently caress Evenia Callseah's chest, tummy, and abdomen..

06:12:32 Evenia softly slides her hand up your shirt and tenderly tweaks a nipple.

06:13:03 Shule keeps sliding his hand down and slowly unbuttons you jeans.

06:13:52 "You gotta be slightly good." Evenia Callseah grins at you. "I said cuddle. Not fuck me till I can't walk."

06:14:00 You grin.

06:14:21 You say, "Ok, I won't fuck you then. Just tease you."

06:14:29 You chuckle.

06:14:31 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl Orbit is shutting down.

06:14:32 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 48 megacredits from AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station.
Evenia Callseah says, "That is so not even fair."

06:14:46 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

06:14:48 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

06:14:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

06:14:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

06:14:53 Evenia softly bites your neck,.

06:15:01 You say, "Time to go deploy."

06:15:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:15:04 Evenia Callseah nods.

06:15:08 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

06:15:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:15:13 Evenia Callseah asks, "Which station is this, anyway?"

06:15:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:15:33 You say, "It's the scooping station for the org."

06:15:37 Evenia Callseah nods.

06:15:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. Five jumps to Olivia's Pearl Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:15:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:15:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

06:15:41 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:15:42 Evenia Callseah says, "I was about to guess that."

You can go south and out.

06:19:34 You press a button marked MODULE BAY DOOR.

06:19:34 A low vibration runs through the starship as the module bay door closes.

06:19:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:19:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:19:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

06:19:42 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

06:19:43 [Enter `yes' or `no']

06:19:43 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

06:19:45 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:19:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:19:47 You say, "And all done."

06:19:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:19:48 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:20:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:20:03 Evenia Callseah says, "You guys and your awesome station ships. It's so not fair."

06:20:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:20:03 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:20:25 You say, "Yeah, we love the constructor."

06:20:35 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah, so does everyone."

06:20:39 Evenia Callseah laughs.

06:20:39 You grin.

06:20:42 You say, "True true."

06:20:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:20:47 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

06:20:52 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

06:20:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

06:21:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

06:21:03 Evenia Callseah says, "It makes life a hell of a lot easier."

06:21:07 You say, "It sure does."

06:21:10 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

06:21:29 Evenia Callseah says, "Yet another reason for the phrase, "Damn AEU people.""

06:21:30 You ask, "Now shall we go to somewhere more fun to cuddle?"

06:21:40 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

06:22:11 You ask, "If I promise not to fuck you silly?"

06:22:38 Evenia Callseah says, "We can just go aboard my carrier if you want. The only other person than me with a key, isn't awake."

06:22:44 You say, "Ok."

06:26:27 Evenia Callseah laughs.

06:26:38 You shrug. "I honestly don't remember."

06:26:54 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Evenia Callseah's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:27:10 Evenia Callseah says, "We did share an apartment for a while just for the friendship. And not living alone. But we weren't a couple. She'd have liked us to be. But it wasn't for me."

06:27:22 You nod.

06:27:28 You say, "Ah, ok."

06:28:15 You gently caress Evenia Callseah's back and waist..

06:28:19 Evenia Callseah says, "Now it seems that Johann might be interested, and people seem to miss the fact that I don't put myself out there as available for a reason."

06:28:30 Evenia pulls you closer, snuggling warmly against you.

06:28:44 I don't see that here.

06:28:49 You smile at Evenia Callseah.

06:28:57 You say, "Oh, he's interested? I had no idea."

06:29:07 Evenia Callseah laughs. "Smart ass."

06:29:12 You chuckle.

06:29:39 Shule rolls over on his back and pulls you on top.

06:29:54 Evenia chuckles softly and molds her body to yours.

06:30:50 Shule continues to caress you gently.

06:31:14 Evenia snuggles her face into your neck and softly kisses it from time to time.

06:31:43 "So, why me?" You smile at Evenia Callseah. "I mean, there are a lot of good or cute or whatever pilots out there."

06:32:58 "Sure, there are cute pilots." Evenia Callseah nods to you. "But those pilots also wouldn't be willing to have someone on the side, or for the person on the side to also have a partner. I had a feeling that you might be okay with all that. So when you started flirting, I let you."

06:33:21 You say, "Ah, ok."

06:33:35 You ask, "So who are you with at the moment?"

06:33:41 Evenia Callseah smiles at you.

06:34:18 Evenia Callseah says, "We haven't made a public thing of it. But it's more than a little complicated anyway. He's hardly ever around."

06:34:30 You nod. "So who?" You grin.

06:34:54 Evenia Callseah asks, "I'm going to assume it doesn't go anywhere?"

06:35:13 You say, "Your secrets are always safe with me."

06:35:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Which means you can get a better ship. Either a faster one or one with more cargo space ETC."

06:35:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I've had a couple promotions."

06:35:36 Evenia Callseah says, "Damien. But there are...Um, reasons that a situation like ours is perfect. He doesn't um..."

06:35:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, my bad."

06:35:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Most recently I just got a notice about a review and a robot just told me they couldn't afford to give me a raise."

06:36:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Does that mean I've been doing a crappy job?"

06:36:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sounds like my last review."

06:36:06 You ask, "He doesn't what?"

06:36:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, it just means you'll probably have to wait till your next review."

06:36:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah ok."

06:36:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think it's just really a way for the company to let you know that they're still paying attention."

06:36:43 Evenia blushes slightly and glances away. "He um, we don't...There's nothing physical."

06:36:57 You say, "Ah, ok."

06:37:10 Evenia Callseah says, "Not my choice."

06:37:20 You ask, "So his then?"

06:37:29 Evenia Callseah nods.

06:37:34 You nod. "I understand."

06:37:49 Evenia Callseah says, "It's not a rule or anything. But he never seems to want it, or try for it. It's got me thinking there's something wrong with me."

06:38:05 You say, "I thought you two were together."

06:38:18 You say to Evenia, "And no, nothing is wrong with you."

06:38:29 You say, "If there is, then there is something wrong with me too."

06:39:31 "I just don't get it." Evenia Callseah shrugs. "Sometimes he gets flirty, all over me...But then just stops. I can't decide if I'm somehow not good enough, or what it is. But yeah, we've been together a while, but it's kept quiet. Either of us needs or wants the bullshit that goes along with public relationships."

06:39:45 You nod. "Makes sense."

06:40:02 You say, "And I'm sorry. Like I said, nothing wrong with you. I've ummm."

06:40:06 I don't understand that.

06:40:07 You blush.

06:40:27 Evenia Callseah asks, "You've um what?"

06:40:31 Evenia Callseah smiles at you.

06:40:55 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out.

06:41:12 Shule blushes even more and glancing away briefly, quietly says, "I've ummm wanted to be physical with you and flirt with you for a while."

06:41:54 Evenia Callseah asks, "Oh really now? Since when?"

06:42:56 You say, "I don't know. For a while now. I really looked forward to seeing you on my beacons and missions. When I figured you and Damien were together, I figured there'd be no chance of ever flirting with you."

06:43:24 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly north.

06:43:33 You say, "Bye Zeus."

06:43:43 Evenia smiles a little sadly. "If he was doing everything right, maybe there wouldn't be. But when you're lonely..."

06:43:49 You nod.

06:43:56 Shule nods understandingly.

06:44:35 You squeeze Evenia Callseah affectionately.

06:44:56 Evenia Callseah says, "But why you want this is beyond me. You seem to be perfectly happy, like nothing could be better. So I don't fully understand why you'd take this risk."

06:46:02 You say, "Well, Lily is a great girl. Butshe's a work-a-holic. Usually, bu the end of the day, she is too tired for much affection. And... ummm. she... doesn't like some of the things I do."

06:46:12 You say, "Work-a-holic."

06:46:26 You say, "Workoholic."

06:46:35 You say, "There, I can say that word."

06:47:23 Evenia nods understandingly at you. "I get that. So I guess we're both here because that little thing is sorta missing for both of us."

06:47:30 You nod and nod.

06:48:14 Evenia Callseah sighs.

06:48:20 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

06:48:21 Evenia Callseah says, "What a mess."

06:48:31 I don't understand that.

06:48:33 You squeeze Evenia Callseah affectionately.

06:48:35 Evenia snuggles in warmly against you.

06:48:59 You say, "If I wasn't with Lily, I'd definitely have gone after you anyways."

06:49:28 Evenia Callseah raises an eyebrow at you.

06:49:35 Evenia Callseah asks, "You'd have tried for me?"

06:49:43 You say, "Oh goodness yeah."

06:50:22 Evenia Callseah smiles at you.

06:50:28 Evenia Callseah says, "That's a surprise."

06:50:30 You say to Evenia, "You're cute, and sexy, and fun.."

06:50:49 Evenia Callseah says, "I figured I was just a hot piece of fuckable meat to you. I didn't think I had any attraction for you."

06:51:07 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

06:51:19 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

06:52:15 Shule squeezes you affectionately and kisses your face and neck.

06:52:24 "Damn." Evenia Callseah laughs. "If you and I were a couple, we probably wouldn't get time to work."

06:52:32 You say, "Oh we would."

06:52:33 You laugh.

06:52:43 You say, "We just might be having fun while we work."

06:52:46 Evenia softly kisses your face and gently tickles your cheekbone with her eyelashes.

06:53:07 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

06:53:52 You say, "You know, naked beacons... salvaging and being naughty..."

06:53:57 You say, "Things like that."

06:54:08 Evenia Callseah says, "Sanity. So basically we'd explode ships and forget to salvage."

06:54:10 Evenia Callseah laughs.

06:54:18 You laugh.

06:54:49 You say, "Nah, I used to salvage and ummm. Have fun at the same time. Never lost a ship that way."

06:55:38 Evenia Callseah asks, "Oh? You think you could salvage while I was totally deep throating you, and licking your balls? You honestly think you could still work?"

06:55:53 You say, "I'd be up for the cchallenge."

06:55:58 You say, "Erm, challenge."

06:56:01 You laugh.

06:56:14 Evenia Callseah says, "I guarantee you, it wouldn't work. I am an oral master."

06:56:24 You grin.

06:56:45 You say to Evenia, "Do you think you could salvage while I went down on you?"

06:56:51 Evenia flicks her tongue teasingly across her lips.

06:56:57 You say, "Mmmm."

06:57:14 Evenia Callseah says, "Hmmm. That depends if fingers were included or not."

06:57:25 You grin.

06:57:57 You ask, "Ok, with fingers?"

06:58:16 Evenia Callseah says, "If you were hitting my spot just right...Probably not."

06:58:21 You grin.

06:58:47 Evenia Callseah says, "But bring on the biting. You were so gentle."

06:58:58 You say to Evenia, "So, I have to ask you. Is there anything you don't like?"

06:59:17 "I was literally about to ask you." Evenia Callseah grins at you. "What are your limits?"

06:59:23 You laugh.

06:59:27 You say to Evenia, "You first."

06:59:39 Evenia Callseah gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

07:00:57 A large soft yellow many-footed creature with a black non-Euclidean shell crawls slowly up a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

07:01:12 Evenia Callseah says, "Not a huge fan of being blindfolded. Every hole is fine. Um...Photos of our sexual acts are a total hard limit. But otherwise...I love pain, I will submit, I love intense pleasure...I can't think of anything I honestly don't like."

07:01:39 You say, "Ok."

07:02:21 Evenia Callseah says, "If you mention anything I don't like I'll say so. But off the top of my head..."

07:02:55 You say, "Ok, I don't like vomit, pee, or things like that."

07:03:40 "That's not for me either." Evenia Callseah shakes her head. "I mean if a tiny pee accident happens during pleasure that's whatever, but intentional? Nah."

07:03:46 You say, "Yeah."

07:03:49 You say, "Exactly."

07:03:51 You say, "Oh good."

07:04:44 Evenia Callseah grins.

07:04:47 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

07:05:05 Evenia Callseah asks, "Keep going?"

07:05:33 You say, "And I like to be the dominant."

07:06:14 "That's fine with me." Evenia Callseah nods. "As long as sometimes. You let me have times where I can enjoy something from you by choice. Like...A treat. almost."

07:06:21 You grin.

07:06:29 You say, "Certainly."

07:07:08 You say, "And yes, I love playing with all three holes."

07:07:18 Evenia Callseah grins. "Well all 3 are open to you."

07:07:46 You say, "And I'll probably turn your butt red more than once."

07:08:25 Evenia Callseah says, "I hope you do. I love that. I like it to hurt. Pain is pleasure. Sometimes being spanked can almost bring me to orgasm on it's own."

07:08:50 You smile.

07:09:22 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm also good with any toys you might want to bring into things."

07:09:28 You say, "Awesome."

07:09:58 Evenia Callseah says, "As long as it isn't fucking massive and rips me open. You know very well how tight I am. I'd like to stay that way."

07:10:03 You grin.

07:10:06 You say, "For sure."

07:11:00 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

07:11:36 Evenia Callseah says, "Ya know. This almost explains a seriously strange dream I had about you a long while ago. I woke up. And totally couldn't understand it. But now..."

07:11:38 Shule runs his hand down your back and slips hit under the waistband of your jeans.

07:11:57 You ask, "Oh, what was the dream?"

07:12:09 "It's sorta bad, you really wanna know?" Evenia Callseah blushes.

07:12:14 You exclaim, "Of course!"

07:12:21 You say, "Especially if it's bad."

07:13:35 Evenia Callseah says, "Well we were aboard critical strike. I guess we'd just done a beacon. And you asked me to stay back. The next thing I knew. You had my jeans down. And I was bent over the main control board. And you were pounding my sex to hell and back."

07:14:10 You exclaim, "Sounds fun!"

07:14:24 You say, "Well, we should make it reality sometime."

07:14:37 Evenia Callseah says, "I certainly wasn't refusing. But I never looked at critical strike the same way again."

07:14:46 You chuckle. "I bet not."

07:15:12 Evenia Callseah says, "I also have a slight confession to make."

07:15:17 You ask, "Yes?"

07:16:01 Evenia Callseah says, "Um. Let's just say that being lonely makes you need things. When I need said things, most of my visions included you."

07:16:29 You grin at Evenia Callseah. "You naughty, naughty girl."

07:16:51 Evenia Callseah smirks. "Maybe just a little."

07:16:57 A perfectly proportioned soft dark violet many-footed creature with an ivory non-Euclidean shell crawls along the bottom of the tank, nudging the debris to be found there.

07:17:41 Evenia Callseah says, "It's all your fault."

07:17:51 You say, "I should take you into Supernova or Critical Strike, bend you over the control board or engineering board and spank you."

07:18:41 "Oh." Evenia Callseah winks at you. "I hope you do one of these days. But I'm sure she has keys. So you might wanna fly her to where she can't be found first."

07:18:53 You say, "Oh, I will."

07:19:14 You say, "And I know where those places are."

07:19:19 Evenia Callseah says, "You are so damn bad."

07:19:22 You say, "Where she can't locate the ship."

07:19:24 Evenia Callseah nods.

07:19:32 You say to Evenia, "It's all you fault."

07:19:43 Evenia Callseah gasps at you. "I am innocent. I did nothing."

07:19:53 You say, "Now she's telling lies."

07:20:00 Evenia Callseah says, "Okay. So maybe I intentionally flashed at the op station when you were there. To tempt you."

07:20:11 You say, "Yeah, probably."

07:20:13 You grin.

07:20:40 Evenia Callseah says, "Well I had a feeling you might have maybe wanted to flirt. I hoped you'd take the hint."

07:20:49 Evenia Callseah says, "I am not usually a flasher."

07:21:00 You grin. "I hoped that was the case."

07:21:31 Evenia Callseah says, "I am a bad girl."

07:21:41 You say, "Yes, yes you are."

07:21:56 Evenia softly rubs her breasts against you.

07:22:25 You say, "I will punish you for being naughty."

07:22:44 Evenia Callseah says, "Mmm. I can't wait for that punishment."

07:22:57 A perfectly proportioned soft violet many-footed creature with a light violet non-Euclidean shell crawls slowly up a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

07:23:18 You grin. "Not yet today as some of what I need is back at my apartment."

07:23:24 Evenia Callseah asks, "I do wanna ask you something though. Even though I don't really have the right to. Am I the only girl. Other than the obvious?"

07:23:34 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

07:23:38 You say, "Yes."

07:24:06 Evenia Callseah says, "That makes me feel a little better. I was hoping I wasn't part of a tangle of women."

07:24:14 You say, "Oh, goodness no."

07:24:34 You say, "I'm not like Cesar who likes to count the number of women he has access to."

07:24:44 You ask, "Oh, did I say that outloud?"

07:24:54 "I wasn't trying to say you're a constant cheater." Evenia Callseah blushes. "I just wanted to figure out the score."

07:24:57 A large soft yellow many-footed creature with a black non-Euclidean shell crawls along the bottom of the tank, nudging the debris to be found there.

07:25:02 You grin at Evenia Callseah. "You're fine."

07:25:05 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

07:25:25 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

07:25:41 Evenia Callseah says, "Well if it matters. It's only you. As well. This isn't something I've ever done before."

07:25:45 You say, "But I figure, if you were the only one I gave hugs to other than Lily, people might get suspicious."

07:26:09 You nod to Evenia Callseah. "Thank you. I do appreciate that."

07:26:49 "Of course." Evenia Callseah nods to you. "I don't make a habit of things like this. But I couldn't resist, not anymore."

07:26:57 You smile at Evenia Callseah.

07:27:27 You say, "The salvage op was actually a great opportunity as there is time between each combat wave."

07:27:50 You say, "As long as I made it back in time to gun..."

07:27:59 You say, "People couldn't really complain."

07:28:02 Evenia Callseah says, "The only person I get jealous of. Is when you hug rogue. If I can be honest. That bitch is the fringe slut. And she really pisses me off. She tried to get between me and Damien. And she's fucked her way through all of the fringe I think."

07:28:24 You say, "That's not surprising. She does that."

07:28:58 You say to Evenia, "But please, don'tworry. I'll never get involved with her."

07:29:03 You say, "Dn't."

07:29:12 You say, "Don't."

07:29:19 Evenia Callseah says, "I meen Keegan. Blake. Eugene. Cesar...All of them. She never fucked Damien though."

07:29:39 You say, "Yeah, that doesn't surprise me one bit."

07:29:56 You say, "Both Keegan and Cesar would fuck just about any female."

07:30:10 "When she tried to fuck him." Evenia Callseah laughs. "Damien quietly pointed out that she'd fucked every guy in the fringe. And he wasn't going to be one of her marks."

07:30:20 You exclaim, "And Rogue would fuck anything male and maybe even female, who knows. Go Damien!"

07:30:53 Evenia Callseah shudders.

07:30:57 A small soft dark green many-footed creature with an ivory non-Euclidean shell crawls slowly up a small plastic statue of a shark.

07:31:00 Evenia Callseah says, "I'd rather fuck a bari queen."

07:31:09 You say, "Me too."

07:31:23 Evenia Callseah says, "Or one of these aquapedes."

07:31:25 Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:31:27 You laugh.

07:31:57 Evenia cuddles into you.

07:32:07 Shule holds you close and rubs your back.

07:32:21 Evenia Callseah says, "Even this is something good for me. Chatting. Talking. Laughing...I spend most of my time alone and sad."

07:32:28 You say, "Awwww."

07:32:41 You say, "Well, I'm glad to keep you company."

07:33:20 You say, "For a few months there, I wasn't even around much."

07:33:25 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

07:33:38 You say, "From about December through March, I think."

07:33:47 Evenia Callseah says, "You really should just say screw it. And get that gorgeous apartment on new earth. She'd never know. And she wouldn't know to look for you there. Either."

07:33:55 Evenia Callseah nods. "Trust me. I noticed."

07:34:03 You say, "Yeah, I've considered it."

07:34:07 Evenia Callseah says, "I missed you. Even from a friend standpoint."

07:34:15 You smile at Evenia Callseah.

07:34:26 You say, "I'm glad someone missed me. I'm not even sure my alliance did."

07:34:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I believe that is three conquests in a row with both goals."

07:35:08 Evenia Callseah says, "I always look at my comm to see if you're awake. I really did miss you."

07:35:20 You smile at Evenia Callseah. "Thank you. That means a lot to me."

07:35:27 You say, "Even just as a friend."

07:35:41 Evenia Callseah nods.

07:35:56 Evenia kisses you softly on the lips.

07:36:02 You kiss Evenia Callseah on the lips.

07:36:34 You exclaim, "Great, so I'm inolved with two people who love to engineer!"

07:36:40 You laugh.

07:36:43 You say, "Involved."

07:36:46 Evenia Callseah nods and laughs.

07:37:03 You say, "That's ok. I love to fly and gun."

07:37:10 Evenia Callseah says, "You are. That part sucks. For some reason on every ship, Lily ends up with it. I don't even just mean yours."

07:37:19 You say, "I'm not the best gunner in the AEU for nothing."

07:37:25 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

07:37:28 You say, "I know."

07:37:57 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm not the best engineer in the fringe for nothing either."

07:37:59 Evenia Callseah grins.

07:38:07 You say, "The problem is... that she's pretty crappy and gunning. So, theonly way she feels useful is to engineer."

07:38:22 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

07:38:46 You say, "And heh, after not being in combat for like three months, I figured I'd lost my touch."

07:38:56 Evenia Callseah says, "Well my thing is that I'm a crap pilot. Combat pilot that is. So I threw myself into something that every good pilot needs. It depresses me greatly that I can't fly."

07:39:21 You say, "Well, everyone has their strengths."

07:39:37 You ask, "Want to know a secret?"

07:39:47 Evenia Callseah says, "Sure."

07:40:13 You say, "For the first few months of my career, I was afraid and often didn't go on beacons or missions because of how crappy a gunner I was."

07:40:51 You say, "Cesar would pick me as a gunner, if he had to."

07:40:59 You say, "Otherwise, he'd pick someone else."

07:41:18 "Sometimes I'm the same way." Evenia Callseah smiles at you. "I hate, when I can't gun well. Like for example, I'm completely shit with 4-second chains. Give me 2-second chains and I can out-gun most people. But those damn spinwards..."

07:41:32 You say, "Yeah."

07:42:09 You say, "Every single beacon or mission, I'd be in last place. Regardless of the room or the weapon we were using."

07:42:17 Evenia Callseah says, "But at least if I engineer, I don't have to get depressed about that."

07:42:27 You nod to Evenia Callseah. "Very true."

07:42:31 Evenia Callseah nods to you. "I'm usually there myself, if it's spinward chains."

07:42:48 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

07:43:10 You say, "And then when we fought escorts... Damn I was hopeless."

07:43:21 Evenia Callseah nods.

07:43:28 Evenia Callseah says, "They're slippery little fuckers."

07:43:44 You say, "They are, but actually they have a distinct rhythm to them."

07:43:58 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah they do. Once you figure that part out, it's easier."

07:44:02 You nod.

07:44:04 You say, "Exactly."

07:44:47 Evenia Callseah says, "The one ship I still have a problem with...Oh. I forget what they're called. but they're a fighter. They are the fucking bane of my existence."

07:44:59 You ask, "Ninlils?"

07:45:03 Evenia Callseah nods and nods.

07:45:09 Evenia Callseah says, "I hate those stupid little fucks."

07:45:12 You say, "Oh, again. It's about rhythm."

07:45:18 You say, "But yeah, they're annoying."

07:45:47 Evenia Callseah says, "I haven't fully figured them out yet. Just enough to hate them."

07:45:49 Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:45:56 You hear Evenia Callseah's metallic gold touch einrophone ringing.

07:45:58 You laugh.

07:46:01 Evenia Callseah removes a metallic gold touch einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

07:46:01 You hear Evenia Callseah's metallic gold touch einrophone ringing.

07:46:05 Evenia Callseah presses a small button on her metallic gold touch einrophone and the ringing stops.

07:46:05 Evenia Callseah places a metallic gold touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

07:46:40 You say, "It also helps to have a pilot that knows their rhythm too."

07:46:48 Evenia Callseah nods.

07:47:09 Evenia Callseah says, "It does. That's why I love it when someone who knows that is flying. I've got a better shot then."

07:47:17 You say, "My first ninlil on a mission, I think I chased it around thee entire sector for like 10 minutes."

07:47:25 Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:47:28 Evenia Callseah says, "Sorry."

07:47:40 You grin.

07:47:55 You say, "I alugh about it now, but the gunner was getting pissed at me."

07:47:57 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo wanders in from elsewhere.

07:47:59 You say, "Laugh."

07:48:06 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Hello."

07:48:08 Evenia Callseah says, "I've just got this image of you, chasing this little fighter and getting more pissed off by the second. That's what I was laughing at."

07:48:13 You laugh.

07:48:20 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo hello."

07:48:29 You say, "Well, it was in a scout, but yeah. The rest was accurate."

07:49:09 Evenia Callseah grins. "Hi mohawk."

07:49:11 Evenia Callseah strokes the soft fur of Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo.

07:49:12 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo purrs and rubs its head against Evenia's hand.

07:49:30 You stroke the soft fur of Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo.

07:49:30 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo purrs softly.

07:50:05 Evenia Callseah says, "Don't worry. My one mean pet isn't on the ship. You won't get your arm bitten off if you pet any of them."

07:50:16 You grin.

07:50:39 You say, "Lily gets disappointed when I don't fly missions or beacons that we're on."

07:50:43 You chuckle.

07:50:46 You say, "No idea why."

07:51:20 Evenia Callseah says, "Because...You're her boyfriend and she likes when you fly? Or maybe it's because she knows you'll call ships for her, and she doesn't wanna ask the pilot to do that."

07:51:47 You say, "I think it's because she feels more confident when I fly. Who knows."

07:51:57 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo rubs up against Evenia Callseah's ankle, purring softly.

07:52:17 Evenia Callseah says, "It really helps when pilots call ships. It's so hard to see back there."

07:52:23 You say, "I know."

07:52:23 Evenia Callseah says, "But most don't think to."

07:52:37 You say, "It's something I started to do for Lily and she thanked me for it."

07:53:14 Evenia Callseah says, "I mean I know it's one extra thing you've gotta remember when you're flying. But if the pilot has time, it's helpful."

07:53:24 You say, "It's not really a big deal."

07:53:34 You say, "For us to do it and I know it can really help."

07:53:47 Evenia Callseah nods. "It really can."

07:54:14 Evenia Callseah says, "Or you could do what Ali did to me once. We were off to do a normal beacon, and we got IFS. Guy didn't even bother to tell me."

07:54:21 You exclaim, "Wow!"

07:54:25 You exclaim, "Shesh!"

07:54:34 "Right?" Evenia Callseah nods.

07:54:49 Evenia Callseah asks, "I'm like...Uh, dude? When were you gonna mention that slight change in plans?"

07:54:56 You exclaim, "Yeah, no kidding!"

07:55:25 You say, "It really helped when Lily and I flew very high beacons."

07:55:43 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh fuck me. I love, very highs."

07:55:48 You grin.

07:56:17 You say, "It means everyone has to really pay attention and do their job the best they can."

07:56:27 Evenia Callseah says, "The most I've done is very high destroyers. I do very high corvettes with Johann all the time. But sometimes we'll bring out the destroyer."

07:56:33 You say, "Otherwise, pop goes the ship."

07:56:37 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

07:56:49 You say, "I've done a few very high destroyer ones."

07:56:57 A perfectly proportioned soft violet many-footed creature with a violet non-Euclidean shell crawls slowly up a plastic frond of white sea fern.

07:57:25 You say, "I love doing very highs in my fighter."

07:57:36 Evenia Callseah says, "That guy is nuts. I've never known a pilot till him, that can slide through very high corvettes and not even get touched."

07:57:43 You grin.

07:58:08 You say, "It's all about timing."

07:58:14 Evenia Callseah nods. "It is."

07:58:20 Evenia Callseah says, "But it's still insane to see."

07:58:25 You grin.

07:59:19 Evenia Callseah says, "He also does them for me because he knows how much I wanna fly but just suck at it. So his answer, is to take me on the beacons I love."

07:59:26 You smile.

07:59:57 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo wanders into the head.

08:00:02 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Night all."

08:00:08 Evenia Callseah says, "Probably hoping he'll win favor into my panties as well."

08:00:12 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Sleep good, Rogue."

08:00:12 You grin.

08:00:14 You chuckle.

08:01:01 Evenia Callseah says, "But that's a can of worms I'll never open. I mean...The guy only recently split from his wife. Fuck all that."

08:01:07 Shule slips   his hand inside the back of your panties. Like that?

08:01:13 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

08:01:24 Evenia Callseah giggles at you. "Yes, like that."

08:01:57 Iram the large golden unicorn felo wanders in from the north.

08:02:03 Evenia Callseah strokes the soft fur of Iram the large golden unicorn felo.

08:02:03 Iram the large golden unicorn felo purrs and rubs its head against Evenia's hand.

08:02:07 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged and is now shutting down.

08:02:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

08:02:16 You stroke the soft fur of Iram the large golden unicorn felo.

08:02:16 Iram the large golden unicorn felo purrs softly.

08:02:27 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly into the area.

08:02:28 Evenia Callseah says, "They're all curious."

08:02:30 Evenia Callseah grins.

08:02:32 You grin.

08:03:08 Evenia Callseah strokes a Tardick lizard named Zeus's warm scaly skin.

08:03:20 Evenia says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus, "You always get all the attention. Damn attention hog."

08:03:35 Shule unbuttons and unzips your jeans and tugs down  on them gently.

08:03:40 You grin at a Tardick lizard named Zeus.

08:03:46 Evenia Callseah winks at you.

08:03:53 Evenia Callseah says, "Behave."

08:03:56 Evenia Callseah tickles you!

08:03:57 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo wanders in from elsewhere.

08:04:12 You reach for Evenia Callseah and tug insistently at a pair of black low rise denim jeans, indicating that you want to remove it from her.

08:04:22 You tug Evenia Callseah's pair of black low rise denim jeans off over her legs.

08:04:26 You grin.

08:04:27 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tail.

08:04:30 You put down a pair of black low rise denim jeans.

08:04:37 Evenia Callseah grins. "That is not behaving."

08:04:42 You chuckle.

08:05:01 You say, "I stopped behaving ever since I walked into this ship."

08:05:13 Evenia Callseah says, "Actually, you stopped before then."

08:05:19 You say, "True."

08:05:41 Evenia Callseah says, "Aboard your woman's ship, no less."

08:05:45 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

08:05:49 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

08:05:56 You chuckle.

08:05:57 Iram the large golden unicorn felo rubs up against Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo, and both animals purr softly.

08:06:01 You say, "Actually, it's the org ship."

08:06:07 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh."

08:06:11 Evenia Callseah says, "Well that's not as bad."

08:06:13 Evenia Callseah laughs.

08:06:18 You say, "Well, she donated it to the org."

08:06:40 Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her close-cropped, bristly hair is glossy obsidian and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces her right upper ear, a thick gold ring pierces her right lower lip, and a thick gold ring pierces her left lower lip.
 She is wearing a finely crafted choker of polished rounded squares of blue and gold dichroic glass, a tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with "Fire All The Damn Minis!" written in gold letters, a pair of blood-spattered black leather forearm bands with nine rows of two-inch-long rusty steel spiked studs, a glittering gold chain of tiny linked daggers around her waist, a pair 
08:06:41 of very brief panties of fine deep blue cotton, and a pair of black leather boots with medium heels and steel buckles up the sides. She is also wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side, and a teal battle hummingbird stamp. Her head, face, both eyes, both elbows, both hands, both hips, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

08:06:49 Evenia Callseah grins.

08:07:06 a pair of very brief panties of fine deep blue cotton

08:07:07 These panties provide minimal coverage with sides no more than an inch wide. They are made of ultra fine deep blue cotton lawn with a slight transparency.
It covers your groin.

08:07:21 "Fuck sakes Ted, shut up." Evenia Callseah glances at a mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator. "Why did we let you in the org again?"

08:07:37 You chuckle.

08:08:11 You gently caress Evenia Callseah's back, waist and butt..

08:08:11 Evenia Callseah says, "He sends me crazy. If I ever truly go nuts, it'll be because of him."

08:08:21 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

08:08:26 You say, "I'll remember that."

08:08:32 Evenia wriggles against you.

08:08:58 A small soft dark green many-footed creature with an ivory non-Euclidean shell crawls up along the side of the glass at a stately pace.

08:09:29 Evenia Callseah says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Nope, AEU girl."

08:09:45 You ask, "What about AEU girl?"

08:09:54 You chuckle.

08:09:57 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh. He wanted to know if it was me, that the news was about."

08:10:03 You say, "Oh."

08:10:40 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

08:10:43 I don't understand that.

08:11:00 Evenia Callseah turns off a mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator.

08:11:06 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Is anyone near 287 that also have a coffee dispenser?"

08:11:15 There appear to be about 8 pilots recently active.

08:11:15 The communicator network detects:

08:11:15 Evenia Callseah says, "I mean...I can see why he'd think so."

08:11:17 Evenia Callseah laughs.

08:11:20 You laugh.

08:11:27 You ask, "Which news are you referring to?"

08:11:44 Evenia Callseah says, "The one about the scooping thing."

08:11:49 You say, "Oh."

08:11:57 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo wanders north.

08:12:11 You say, "Oh, I know who said that."

08:12:28 "Our name for her is AEU girl." Evenia Callseah nods. "None of us really um, well..."

08:12:33 You chuckle.

08:12:44 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Dropping on off at the recharge now."

08:12:44 You ask, "None of you what?"

08:13:13 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Aha! I'll be there. Thank you."

08:13:32 Evenia Callseah says, "None of us like her. My dislike began a very long time ago, when she insulted the way that I dress. She said spikes were disgusting, and that I dressed like a guy. That was about where our friendship ended."

08:13:41 You exclaim, "Ouch!"

08:13:47 You say, "Yeah, I can see why."

08:13:57 Iram the large golden unicorn felo rubs up against Evenia Callseah's ankle, purring softly.

08:14:00 "You can see why she said that?" Evenia Callseah raises an eyebrow at you.

08:14:10 You say, "No, I can see why your friendship ended."

08:14:27 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh yeah."

08:14:44 Evenia Callseah says, "And she also said the perfume I wear is mostly warn by slutty women."

08:15:07 You say, "Good thing I wasn't around when she said that. I'd have kicked her ass from New Earth all the way to Andies and beyond."

08:15:33 Evenia Callseah says, "I wanted too, and almost did. Only one thing saved her."

08:15:42 You ask, "And what was that?"

08:15:50 Evenia Callseah says, "Fucking Demarco."

08:15:56 You say, "Oh dear god."

08:16:24 Evenia Callseah says, "He dragged me away before I could do anything. I was about to rip her apart."

08:16:31 You say, "He's not very popular with the AEU."

08:16:57 A large soft yellow many-footed creature with a black non-Euclidean shell crawls up along the side of the glass at a stately pace.

08:17:03 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah...I sorta got that impression. I don't know what he did though, he'd never tell me."

08:17:17 You say, "Just treated all of us like shit."

08:17:27 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out.

08:17:53 You say, "Incredibly disrespectful and negative."

08:17:58 Iram the large golden unicorn felo rubs up against Evenia Callseah's ankle, purring softly.

08:18:17 Evenia Callseah says, "He never had one good word to say about the AEU. Me personally, I love the AEU. I even remember telling him that if I could have, I'd have joined the AEU."

08:18:27 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

08:18:29 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

08:18:58 A large soft yellow many-footed creature with a black non-Euclidean shell crawls along the bottom of the tank, nudging the debris to be found there.

08:19:02 You say, "He tried to hit on Lily and when she wouldn't give him the time of day, he got even more mad."

08:19:24 Evenia Callseah says, "I remember the letter you sent him when he popped that ship and you were SDC. I could so read between the lines."

08:19:37 "You could?" You chuckle.

08:19:42 You ask, "You read that letter?"

08:19:45 Evenia Callseah nods.

08:19:49 Evenia Callseah says, "He let me read it."

08:19:55 You say, "Hell, I don't remember what I said."

08:19:57 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly north.

08:20:57 A large soft yellow many-footed creature with a black non-Euclidean shell crawls slowly up a small plastic statue of a shark.

08:20:59 Shule continues to caress you, occasionally slipping his hand under your panties.

08:21:06 Evenia Callseah says, "It was basically along the lines of sorry you lost the ship. If there's anything I can do, let me know. Not those words. But I remember reading it and just thinking...I more think Shule means that maybe you need a few flying lessons, and please don't fly till you get them, you dick."

08:21:18 You laugh. "Good job."

08:21:44 Evenia Callseah nods and nods.

08:21:52 Evenia gently kisses your neck.

08:22:06 Evenia Callseah says, "I mean. I didn't say that. But I knew it was what you meant."

08:22:09 You say, "He damn near lost a cruiser on missions and he should have been fine."

08:22:14 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

08:22:27 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

08:22:57 Evenia Callseah says, "I always wondered how the fuck he got that cruiser. Magic? Because the flying I saw was, well..."

08:23:06 You say, "Yeah, I know. Seriously."

08:23:16 You say, "It left a lot to be desired."

08:23:30 You say, "And I'm no Ace pilot, but still."

08:23:52 Evenia Callseah nods. "I was really new then, but I'm not stupid."

08:24:00 You nod.

08:24:28 Evenia Callseah asks, "Oh. Did I ever tell you about his letter of retirement and apology he sent me, with a gift?"

08:24:43 Shule pulls down the waistband of your panties a bit and snaps it against your butt, "Nope, you didn't.

08:25:01 Evenia Callseah giggles at you.

08:25:18 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

08:26:13 Evenia Callseah says, "He sent me this fuckoff long letter about how sorry he was that he was a failure, how he just wasn't a good pilot and that he was retiring. He sent me almost half of the lenses I'd need to make robot boy here. He said that he wanted me to have one, because I'd learned to love them, thanks to his. Before he got me used to them, I'd run, if I saw one of these guys. Now mine is never away from me."

08:26:32 You say, "Ah, ok."

08:26:53 You say, "So he retired? His robo is still around though."

08:26:57 You say, "Robot."

08:27:06 Evenia Callseah asks, "It is?"

08:27:10 You nod.

08:27:18 You say, "It's guarding the mail room on New Earth."

08:27:26 Evenia Callseah says, "Well he said he was going to. I haven't seen him since."

08:27:32 You say, "Ah, ok."

08:27:47 Demarco Scott does not seem to have an active communicator.

08:27:57 Evenia Callseah asks, "How in hell did it get there?"

08:27:58 Evenia Callseah laughs.

08:28:03 You laugh. "No idea."

08:28:04 Evenia Callseah asks, "Did it just wander off?"

08:28:20 You say, "Nah, he must have left it there. Why he did is beyond me."

08:28:38 Evenia says to Vartija the arachnoid security robot, "Are you going to start getting a mind of your own and randomly shoot people, and wander off?"

08:28:44 You laugh.

08:28:58 A perfectly proportioned soft dark violet many-footed creature with an ivory non-Euclidean shell crawls slowly up a plastic frond of white sea fern.

08:29:46 Evenia smiles at the aquarium. "I love these guys, specially these shells. When I can't sleep, I always sleep near them. They relax me. They're just so chill."

08:29:52 You grin.

08:29:57 You say, "Yeah, they are."

08:30:57 Evenia Callseah says, "People do not respect the grand aquapede enough."

08:31:06 You nod and grin.

08:31:23 Evenia Callseah says, "Sanity save me. I almost sounded like Ather then."

08:31:26 Evenia Callseah shudders.

08:31:29 You laugh.

08:31:33 You squeeze Evenia Callseah affectionately.

08:31:57 Wigglebutt the large dark indigo bobtailed felo wanders in from the north.

08:32:00 Evenia Callseah nuzzles your neck softly.

08:32:06 You kiss Evenia Callseah softly on the neck.

08:32:07 "Wigglebutt!" Evenia Callseah grins.

08:32:09 Evenia Callseah strokes the soft fur of Wigglebutt the large dark indigo bobtailed felo.

08:32:09 Wigglebutt the large dark indigo bobtailed felo purrs and rubs its head against Evenia's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

08:32:10 You grin.

08:32:14 You stroke the soft fur of Wigglebutt the large dark indigo bobtailed felo.

08:32:14 Wigglebutt the large dark indigo bobtailed felo purrs softly.

08:32:34 Evenia Callseah says, "It's the perfect name."

08:32:35 Evenia Callseah laughs.

08:32:38 You laugh.

08:33:29 Evenia Callseah says, "Hell. Even Mel's pet felo is around here somewhere. She gave her to me to watch for a while. She said she was going to be busy."

08:33:42 You ask, "Oh really?"

08:33:45 You say, "Ah, ok."

08:33:56 Evenia Callseah nods.

08:34:14 Evenia Callseah says, "I don't mind. It means I get Zeus too. Though in reality in the last year, I've had him more than she has."

08:34:17 Evenia Callseah grins.

08:34:23 You grin.

08:34:39 You say, "Yeah, I'm starting to take Asteria more than Lily does."

08:35:10 Evenia Callseah says, "You're lucky. You're dating someone who has a lizard. You have constant access. I hate you."

08:35:16 You chuckle.

08:35:17 You say, "True."

08:35:26 Evenia Callseah pouts at you.

08:35:29 Evenia Callseah says, "Just not fair."

08:35:30 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

08:35:35 You say, "You get Zeus for now."

08:35:42 Evenia Callseah nods.

08:35:50 Evenia Callseah says, "Probably for a few months if I know Mel."

08:35:55 You nod. "Probably."

08:35:57 Wigglebutt the large dark indigo bobtailed felo wanders north.

08:36:19 Evenia Callseah says, "Well she knows that he gets amazing care with me, and he's never far away."

08:36:24 You grin.

08:37:00 Evenia Callseah says, "Plus, I think secretly it makes her life a bit easier. She's still stuck with Lillians."

08:37:05 You kiss Evenia Callseah on the lips.

08:37:23 Evenia Callseah kisses you on the lips.

08:37:26 You say, "Oh, really? Yeah, that makes sense. I didn't know she is still stuck with Lillian's."

08:37:47 You say, "I hardly ever see Lillian around."

08:37:57 "I'd guess so." Evenia Callseah nods. "I don't ask. But Lillian hasn't been around. And Mel would never let a lizard starve."

08:37:57 Iram the large golden unicorn felo rubs up against Evenia Callseah's ankle, purring softly.

08:38:09 You nod.

08:38:14 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh. Lillian hasn't been around for months. I um. Think that Mel is just done."

08:38:25 You ask, "Really?"

08:38:38 You ask, "As in she's no longer going to date Lillian?"

08:39:14 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh yeah. I get that impression. If Mel was still happy with Lillian, she'd never have sat on my lap down at 273, or cuddled up to me to make people jealous. I'm pretty sure it's either completely over, or over for Mel."

08:39:26 You say, "Ah, ok."

08:39:57 Evenia Callseah says, "Like it was a joke between her and I, because there's no feelings between us. But we were torturing Joel and Bryan."

08:40:03 You chuckle.

08:40:22 You say, "They're just fun to torture."

08:40:25 You chuckle.

08:40:43 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh yeah they are. But now I got Joel calling my boobs mini cannons."

08:40:45 Evenia Callseah laughs.

08:40:48 You laugh.

08:40:50 You say, "Yeah."

08:41:08 Evenia Callseah looks down at herself thoughtfully.

08:41:14 Evenia Callseah says, "I do not think they're minis."

08:41:16 Evenia Callseah grins.

08:41:20 You grin.

08:41:36 You say, "Yeah, not minis."

08:41:44 Evenia Callseah grins at you.

08:41:47 Evenia Callseah pulls up a tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with "Fire All The Damn Minis!" written in gold letters and exposes her slightly larger than average firm breasts tipped with large dark brown nipples for a moment. Both nipples are pierced with a shiny gold ring.

08:41:56 I see no "grin" here.

08:41:58 You grin.

08:42:04 Remove what?

08:42:08 Remove what?

08:42:29 You reach for Evenia Callseah and tug insistently at a tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with "Fire All The Damn Minis!" written in gold letters, indicating that you want to remove it from her.

08:42:34 You pull Evenia Callseah's tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with "Fire All The Damn Minis!" written in gold letters off over her head.

08:42:41 You put down a tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with "Fire All The Damn Minis!" written in gold letters.

08:42:59 Evenia Callseah says, "I love that shirt. Nicolette makes me all kinds of shirts. It's amusing what she comes up with."

08:43:04 You laugh.

08:43:08 You exclaim, "It's awesome!"

08:43:59 Evenia Callseah says, "It'd be perfect for you AEU types."

08:44:01 Evenia Callseah snickers.

08:44:03 You laugh.

08:44:30 You say, "I have actually called for minis once. I think people were so surprised they weren't sure I was serious."

08:44:36 You chuckle.

08:44:38 Evenia Callseah gasps.

08:44:55 Evenia Callseah says, "I'd have been like "Um, repeat that please?""

08:45:00 You laugh.

08:45:57 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly into the area.

08:45:58 Iram the large golden unicorn felo wanders into the head.

08:46:14 You say, "Yeah, probably why I had to repeat it."

08:46:36 Evenia Callseah says, "On Bryan's missions earlier. It was damn near not possible to keep up with the grid. Fucking constant minis is not nice."

08:46:50 You say, "No, it's rough on the engineer."

08:47:19 You say, "I hated engineering for Cesar's ships when he'd have gunners do constant minis then he'd do charged shot."

08:47:27 Evenia Callseah says, "I kept you guys around 700, but that was the extreme best I could do."

08:47:43 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

08:48:07 You say, "Except me, right? My grid was easy to keep charged."

08:48:12 Evenia Callseah says, "Fuck that. If he did that and went for charged shot. I'd walk out of engineering. And tell him to engineer his damn self."

08:48:28 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

08:48:34 You say, "Yeah, I felt like doing that."

08:48:56 Evenia Callseah says, "You, you damn pain in the butt. Your grid was hell."

08:49:01 You chuckle.

08:49:33 Shule looks at you innocently, "But why?"

08:49:35 Evenia Callseah says, "Though actually, Bryan at one point managed to kill his more than you did. I had to read my readouts twice to believe it."

08:49:42 You laugh.

08:49:52 You ask, "What room was he in?"

08:50:00 Evenia Callseah says, "He was in 5."

08:50:03 You say, "Oh."

08:50:14 You say, "Well, yeah. He can double volley from that room."

08:50:24 You say, "You don't want me to ever double volley."

08:50:33 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh yes, I know. He doesn't believe in single goddamn minis."

08:50:38 You nod.

08:50:58 A small soft dark green many-footed creature with an ivory non-Euclidean shell crawls along the bottom of the tank, nudging the debris to be found there.

08:51:11 Evenia Callseah says, "I'll call you out if you do."

08:51:13 Evenia Callseah laughs.

08:51:18 You laugh.

08:51:47 You say, "On Cesar's wasps, he had double minis and something like 2000 grid. I managed to drain his grid completely."

08:52:11 Evenia Callseah asks, "Though I have a ton of experience with keeping grids charged. You ever tried engineering a Phanta?"

08:52:12 You exclaim, "It was hecka fun!"

08:52:20 Evenia Callseah raises an eyebrow at you. "Well fuck me."

08:52:28 A Tardick lizard named Zeus blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

08:52:31 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

08:52:33 You say, "I have."

08:52:36 You say, "It's a pain."

08:52:48 Evenia Callseah nods.

08:52:55 Evenia Callseah says, "One beacon, 2 energy dumps."

08:52:57 Evenia Callseah laughs.

08:52:59 You laugh.

08:53:06 You say, "And people complain about the clipper."

08:53:38 Evenia Callseah says, "I love the clipper. I don't get to go on them enough."

08:53:50 Evenia Callseah says, "Then again I love the Phanta too, so maybe I'm just crazy."

08:53:50 You exclaim, "I love my clipper! It's awesome!"

08:54:03 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

08:54:21 You say, "We've already established that you are crazy."

08:54:25 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

08:54:28 Evenia Callseah pokes you in the ribs!

08:54:33 You chuckle.

08:54:39 Evenia Callseah says, "I will bite you."

08:54:49 You say to Evenia, "And I will spank you."

08:54:55 Evenia Callseah grins at you.

08:54:58 A perfectly proportioned soft dark violet many-footed creature with an ivory non-Euclidean shell crawls slowly up a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

08:55:18 Evenia Callseah says, "Just to wind Johann up. I got a Phanta for the org. He hates. The Phanta."

08:55:29 You chuckle.

08:55:52 You say, "I got to use my clipper to help save a historic ship today."

08:56:02 Evenia Callseah laughs.

08:56:13 Evenia Callseah asks, "So that was you that saved the mule?"

08:56:19 You say, "Yep."

08:56:30 You say, "Well, I was one of them."

08:56:49 Evenia Callseah says, "If he ever suggests I go do that again, remind me that I said I never would again."

08:56:57 You chuckle. "Ok."

08:56:58 A small soft dark green many-footed creature with an ivory non-Euclidean shell crawls slowly up a plastic frond of white sea fern.

08:57:13 You say to Evenia, "What if I ask you?"

08:57:16 You chuckle.

08:57:19 Evenia Callseah says, "That was torture. Me and my poor AEU 3."

08:57:27 You say, "Yeah, I've been there."

08:57:32 Evenia says to you, "If you asked me...Hmmm, what reward would I get?"

08:57:43 You say, "Oh, I could think of many."

08:57:50 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What's everybody up to?"

08:57:58 Iram the large golden unicorn felo wanders in from elsewhere.

08:58:15 Evenia Callseah says, "Well. Depending on the reward. I'd think about it."

08:58:19 You grin.

08:58:32 Evenia Callseah says, "But I love that paper battlesuit, I really do. I just need a couple energy minimods."

08:58:44 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Hello. I'm looking for artifacts at the bubble. What're you up to?"

08:58:56 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi, and, same."

08:58:58 A large soft amethyst many-footed creature with a light red non-Euclidean shell crawls along the bottom of the tank, nudging the debris to be found there.

08:58:59 You ask, "How ever long it took to clear it out, I'd give you the same amount of time to have me to do you anything you'd like?"

08:59:07 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm trying to find out what everybody's up to."

08:59:11 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh."

08:59:26 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Just poking around. Nothing solid yet."

08:59:41 [General Communication] Luja Garland snickers.

08:59:43 Evenia Callseah asks, "Hmmm, anything? Without domination? All my choice?"

08:59:44 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And, I have just found one."

08:59:49 You nod.

09:00:22 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "What's going on with your luck, Ted? I'm jealous."

09:00:24 Evenia Callseah says, "Count me in every Conquest."

09:00:29 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

09:00:54 You say, "See? I give good rewards."

09:00:57 You grin.

09:01:10 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It is very good just now, it's not always like this."

09:01:33 "You do." Evenia Callseah grins. "I can't resist that. I love being dominated, but there's also something sexy when you just get to tell the dominant what you want, and they'll do it."

09:01:41 You say, "For sure."

09:01:45 You smile at Evenia Callseah.

09:01:57 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly north.

09:01:58 Iram the large golden unicorn felo wanders into the head.

09:02:23 Evenia Callseah says, "You might be surprised though."

09:02:34 You say, "I probably will."

09:02:58 A small soft dark green many-footed creature with an ivory non-Euclidean shell crawls slowly up a small plastic statue of a shark.

09:03:01 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm most likely to want you to fuck my face till I can't feel my lips anymore."

09:03:06 You grin.

09:03:29 You say, "I'd happily go along with that."

09:03:58 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo wanders in from the north.

09:04:13 Evenia Callseah says, "It's even hotter if it's done with me on my back. Pinned under you. I can't get away. I can't move. I just have to take it."

09:04:24 You say, "Mmmm."

09:04:28 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

09:04:58 A large soft yellow many-footed creature with a black non-Euclidean shell crawls up along the side of the glass at a stately pace.

09:05:11 Evenia Callseah grins. "I really am a bad girl."

09:05:21 You say, "Yeah, you are."

09:05:29 Evenia Callseah says, "You love it."

09:05:32 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

09:05:34 You exclaim, "I do!"

09:05:36 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

09:05:58 Evenia Callseah says, "Did you think I'd be this kinky? Or did you think I'd be a good little girl."

09:06:13 You say, "I didn't know, but I sure hoped you'd be this kinky."

09:06:44 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm actually writing another version of the sex for girls book. But bigger and better."

09:06:50 You grin.

09:07:21 Evenia Callseah says, "I read that and was like...Damn, you missed all the really good stuff."

09:07:23 You ask, "Did you think I'd be open to all of this? Or did you think I was all innocent?"

09:07:33 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

09:07:34 Evenia Callseah gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

09:07:57 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo rubs up against a black air foam bed with a set of indigo silk sheets, a large indigo bed pillow, and a large silky orange quilt embroidered with golden yellow and silver stars on it, purring softly.

09:08:26 Evenia Callseah says, "I thought maybe you might be at least a bit kinky. You have this way of like, coming across super innocent. Mostly how you act, stuff like that. Most of the time, that means the person is covering something about themselves that is not so innocent."

09:08:35 You laugh.

09:08:37 You say, "Very good."

09:09:03 You say, "I actually do try to come across as pretty innocent."

09:09:08 You say, "But..."

09:09:35 You say, "I'm very adventurous."

09:09:41 You say, "And open."

09:09:58 Maggie the obese indigo feathered felo wanders in from the north.

09:09:58 Iram the large golden unicorn felo wanders in from elsewhere.

09:10:05 Evenia Callseah nods.

09:10:37 Evenia Callseah says, "Trust me, your act didn't fool me. You can't act super innocent, then be a complete perv on comms and think smart people like me won't see behind that."

09:10:43 You laugh.

09:11:34 You say, "I probably surprised a few people with some of my comments."

09:11:40 You say, "Over comms."

09:11:45 Evenia Callseah laughs.

09:11:51 You exclaim, "It's fun!"

09:11:53 Evenia Callseah says, "Most likely."

09:12:45 You say, "I enjoy saying things in a way that could be innocent, but I know everyone will take it in another way."

09:12:46 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh it's amazing hearing the total silence sometimes after you let out something totally fucked up. I don't think most people know what to make of you."

09:12:52 You laugh.

09:12:58 A small soft dark green many-footed creature with an ivory non-Euclidean shell crawls up along the side of the glass at a stately pace.

09:13:05 You exclaim, "I love it!"

09:13:37 Evenia Callseah absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

09:13:58 Maggie the obese indigo feathered felo wanders north.

09:14:06 Evenia Callseah says, "I do it myself sometimes. Usually I hold back. And just keep quiet. But some days. I can't resist disturbing them all."

09:14:49 You exclaim, "I still remember when Demarco and I don't remember who was talking about rift drives in a sexual way and I was like, you know, it helps to know how to find the points of interest. Demarco was like the hell shule?!"

09:15:07 Evenia Callseah laughs.

09:15:12 Evenia Callseah says, "I can so hear that."

09:15:30 You exclaim, "I laughed so hard!"

09:15:57 Hathor the hefty indigo ridged felo wanders north.

09:16:14 You say, "I'm surprised I didn't wake up Lily I was laughing so hard."

09:16:44 Evenia Callseah says, "That's like the time I got talking to a Fringer. Um...Kirk his name is on general. about deep insertion into the rift. and just a light. gentle insertion. That...Fuck. that went into every realm of fucked up."

09:17:01 You say, "Yeah, I think that's where the conversation started."

09:17:18 You say, "Or how it started."

09:17:29 Evenia Callseah laughs.

09:17:59 Evenia Callseah says, "Kirk is the only fringer who can get as bad as me. The others all bow out early. I often make Damien blush. It's hilarious."

09:18:05 You laugh.

09:18:25 You say, "I play along, I just wait for the prefect moment to surprise people."

09:18:30 You say, "Perfect."

09:18:58 A large soft black many-footed creature with a violet non-Euclidean shell crawls up along the side of the glass at a stately pace.

09:19:31 Evenia Callseah says, "I remember once we were bitching about some league woman. I was like, stupid bitch ain't talkin' out of her horizontal lips that's for sure, it's all the vertical smile. Damien first about died, then couldn't breathe for five minutes and could only manage tiny squeaks he was laughing that hard."

09:19:42 You laugh.

09:21:04 Evenia Callseah says, "Now when you're a girl, that can make a guy blush...That's something to be proud of."

09:21:12 You laugh. "It sure is."

09:21:43 Evenia Callseah says, "I honestly was waiting to catch his eyeballs, I thought they were gonna fall out of his head."

09:21:48 You laugh.

09:21:51 You exclaim, "I bet!"

09:21:58 Iram the large golden unicorn felo stares curiously up at you.

09:22:03 You stroke the soft fur of Iram the large golden unicorn felo.

09:22:03 Iram the large golden unicorn felo purrs softly.

09:22:43 Evenia Callseah yawns. "I do believe, it's about bedtime though."

09:22:50 You say, "Yeah, I do too."

09:22:58 You say to Evenia, "See? I just cuddled."

09:23:12 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm amazed. You managed to behave."

09:23:31 You grin at Evenia Callseah. "With you it's definitely difficult."

09:23:39 Evenia Callseah laughs.

09:23:43 Evenia Callseah picks up a tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with "Fire All The Damn Minis!" written in gold letters.

09:23:46 Evenia Callseah pulls a tight-fitting indigo t-shirt with "Fire All The Damn Minis!" written in gold letters on over her head.

09:23:49 Evenia Callseah picks up a pair of black low rise denim jeans.

09:23:53 Evenia Callseah pulls a pair of black low rise denim jeans on over her legs.

09:23:58 You smile.

09:24:15 Evenia Callseah says, "That is proof that you weren't so well behaved."

09:24:22 You laugh.

09:24:30 Evenia Callseah stands up from a black air foam bed with a set of indigo silk sheets, a large indigo bed pillow, and a large silky orange quilt embroidered with golden yellow and silver stars on it.

09:24:52 You say to Evenia, "If I had it my way, we'd already be in my cruiser and you'd have laredy been bent over the control panel and have a red butt to prove it."

09:24:53 You stand up from a black air foam bed with a set of indigo silk sheets, a large indigo bed pillow, and a large silky orange quilt embroidered with golden yellow and silver stars on it.

09:25:00 Evenia wags a finger at you. "Come on, lazy butt."

09:25:06 You laugh.

09:25:15 Evenia Callseah holds your hand, taking you into her group.

09:27:13 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

09:27:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

09:27:20 The ship is already moving.

09:27:23 The ship is already moving.

09:27:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

09:27:24 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

09:27:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

09:27:25 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

09:27:26 There are no other ships in the sector.

09:27:29 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

09:27:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

09:27:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

09:27:32 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

09:27:32 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

09:27:39 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

09:27:40 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

09:27:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

09:28:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

09:28:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

09:28:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

09:28:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

09:28:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

09:28:26 You pull a large lever towards you.

09:28:26 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

09:28:27 You scramble to your feet.

09:28:27 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

09:28:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

10:38:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah it is."

10:40:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You know how you can use the computer to search for a debris chunk?"

10:41:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And it will tell you its approximate location and grade."

10:41:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."

10:41:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you need a grapple that matches that grade rating to be able to harvest it?"

10:41:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that what that means?"

10:42:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Pretty much,  yeah. You can sometimes manage a little higher than your grapples grade, but not by too much."

10:42:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Tran 1 higher grade is also higher value."

11:21:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Damn, I so want one of those but I don't have the credits in EAOS right now."

11:21:40 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah heh, me niether."

11:37:09 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Hello."

11:37:36 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hi."

11:37:36 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yo."

11:38:19 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Before I try anything stupid. Is it possible to leave a ship while autovector is active?"

11:38:36 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Not unless something breaks."

11:38:38 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You can't leave a ship while it is moving."

11:38:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, it is a fairly inactive thing, that if you do it manually requires your attention once a day, or once in 48 hours really, or if you let the workers manage their shifts it requires you to go pay them approximately once a week to keep them happy and otherwise does not involve a lot of work."

11:38:58 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I'd advise you wait till it stops before trying in the event something breaks."

11:38:59 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Ah, that's good to know."

11:39:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Should I be just buying as many parts as I can, and staffing it with tons of people?"

11:39:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I noticed that I can only have one of certain parts."

11:39:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Planning the shifts yourself is, if you are good at it, gonna result in more points, but for me, where I already have so many industry points, that becomes less important."

11:40:14 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "How are you guys?"

11:40:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, you should get as many parts as you can, and as you have more points, more parts will become available."

11:40:40 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm about to sleep, just out at the bubble."

11:40:43 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I'm doing good. I'm at the bubble! How are you?"

11:40:51 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "All right here."

11:40:54 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'm not at the Bubble."

11:40:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are all the parts limited? I'm not going to blow through hundreds of millions trying to max out on drills, am I?"

11:41:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "As for your personell, hmm, how to best explain that."

11:41:05 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am not either."

11:41:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I've never known you be at the Bubble Mel."

11:41:35 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I used to go out there."

11:41:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, from some parts you can buy 2, others only 1."

11:41:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, ok. That's good to know."

11:42:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The higher up you are in industry, the more expensive the parts become. It is really, well turning credits into industry points."

11:42:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

11:42:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "OOk, your workers work in shifts of 8 hours. Any task they do fills an entire shift."

11:43:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "First, each part needs to be installed. Jthen it gets operated, and eventually it will have taken so much damage it will need to be repaired."

11:43:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Each worker will only work 2 shifts in a row before they will demand a shift off duty."

11:44:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, ok."

11:45:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Then, some workers are more productive than others. The more productive they are, the more industry points you will see from their work. But you should also look at how careful your workers are. The more careful, the less damage your parts take and the more shifts they can be operated before they need repairs again."

11:45:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Interesting."

11:45:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Does carefulness factor into repairing at all?"

11:46:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, that is a good question, I do not believe so, but not certain."

11:47:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "OK, later all."

11:47:05 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Later."

11:47:19 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Sleep good, Ted."

11:47:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, you need enough workers to fill the shifts you need filling around the clock, but not more than that."

11:47:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ok."

11:47:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And can I only manage one station?"

11:48:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, only 1 station, and only the one at glittering belt."

11:48:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ok cool."

11:48:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Finally, hmm, at first you may not have the best choice for staff available, so it is wise to check every day whether there are new people you could hire that are better than what you currently have."

11:49:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You can also only hire 3 new workers per day, and 2 per shift."

11:49:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah I noticed that some of them are not amazing."

11:49:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The first week you will have to visit the belt management station frequently to insure your success."

11:51:22 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 24,390,625.00 credits from a xenology submission.

11:52:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

11:59:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have been doing this for over 2 years now, and I have nearly 8500 industry in total. If I go once a week to pay the staff, with about 2 weeks I can then cash in like 70 or 80 points."

11:59:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

11:59:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "But at first it will of course go a lot more slowly, it is still a nice extra bonus."

12:00:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

12:02:33 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 11,156,250.00 credits from a xenology submission.

12:03:04 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Was that 223125000.0 credits?"

12:03:22 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

12:07:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

12:24:09 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Morning."

12:28:09 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hi Hakeem."

12:28:18 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "What're you up to."

12:29:02 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Not much, stamping and checking sectors."

12:40:36 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Bah. 238 sectors and only six artifacts."

12:41:14 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "That is bad luck."

12:41:38 [General Communication] Natasha Carston transmits, "Hello all."

12:41:43 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hello."

12:41:44 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "But I hauled a roid for 66 sectors to get less than 2 credits for it."

12:41:52 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hi morris."

12:41:58 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "First, you are nuts to haul for 66 sectors."

12:42:12 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Holy cow. And hello."

12:42:36 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Trying to find the distance fron barnhans territories to the belt."

12:42:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Howdy Hakeem."

12:43:13 [General Communication] Natasha Carston transmits, "No offense, but, wouldn't that make more sense for someone with some type of charting skills to work out?"

12:43:50 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yes, but I didnt know that at a time."

12:43:59 [General Communication] Natasha Carston transmits, "I mean, I know I'm new and all, but, it seems that unless you had some idea of where those two points were in space to each other, you'd be flying blind."

12:44:13 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I was."

12:44:17 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You are correct."

12:44:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not only that, but you can't use your sensors to know what direction you're going if you're landed on an asteroid. Computer won't show us that."

12:45:04 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I could find this out for you rather quickly."

12:45:07 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Only after you started hauling it."

12:45:10 [General Communication] Natasha Carston transmits, "My father always said, it was easier to invent a better mouse trap, than to build one in the first place."

12:45:21 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels chuckles. "Smart father."

12:45:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

12:45:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I like your pa Natasha."

12:45:41 [General Communication] Luja Garland snickers.

12:45:43 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "If you can sometime explain me how, that would be great melinda."

12:45:56 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I would use my chart."

12:46:26 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "But the other method is going to various places and sending pings."

12:46:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "All I know is Fringe space is generally south of ours."

12:46:41 [General Communication] Natasha Carston transmits, "He was an electronics engineer, so he was used to thinking like that."

12:46:44 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Which, I would not ping directly in those sectors."

12:47:11 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Ah, I thought you would have some cool tools, like that sextant."

12:47:18 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it.

12:47:20 Lily Kaise glides out.

12:47:21 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "A chart is a cool tool."

12:47:45 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "You are right, but I never saw one."

12:47:51 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Ah."

12:47:55 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I guess you are right."

12:48:37 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Any use for the sextant?"

12:49:42 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "For learning to tell where things are with a naked eye, like the Mutuality pilots, sure. For me, I use the sensor banks to help me."

12:51:39 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Seems some being sold on ssn also a telescope, but didnt think there were much use for them."

12:58:18 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "And I heard hammer v fringer."

12:59:03 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Hammer has an unfair advantage over finger."

12:59:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That sounds...painful."

12:59:18 [General Communication] Natasha Carston transmits, "Fringer always wins, we'll find a way to use the force to our advantage, if we're quick about it. But, if your finger slips and gets in the way, its still a decided contest."

15:37:00 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

15:54:28 You carefully set about bolting a wormhole entry stabilization module to a convenient surface.

15:54:47 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "6 rat's fighters in Orion if anybody wants them."

15:55:21 You pick up Shule Elemmire's workbench.

15:55:26 You put Shule Elemmire's workbench in a leather briefcase.

15:55:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:55:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:55:36 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:55:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:55:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:55:51 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

15:55:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:55:58 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:55:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:56:01 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

15:56:03 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:56:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:56:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:56:09 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "Firestorm, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

16:04:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:04:32 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

16:10:22 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:10:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Medium Slicer". The organization has earned 1,314,059.56 credits.

16:10:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:10:56 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:11:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:11:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:11:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:11:16 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:11:16 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:11:17 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:11:48 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

16:12:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

16:12:35 You see a destroyer here.
"Firestorm" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AS-4F" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a geodesic radome and a smooth dome on the forward end.

16:15:39 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

16:16:17 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:16:17 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:16:19 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

16:16:20 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

16:16:22 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:16:23 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:16:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:16:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:16:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:16:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:16:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Endymion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:16:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:16:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

16:16:47 You're already sitting.

16:16:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:16:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:16:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:16:51 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:16:52 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Endymion Orbit."

16:16:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:16:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:16:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:16:56 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Endymion in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:16:59 Via general sector communication, Endymion transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

16:17:02 Those coordinates are invalid.  The format is: "x, y, z"

16:17:04 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Endymion.

16:17:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:17:37 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:17:38 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:17:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:17:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:17:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:17:58 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:17:58 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:17:59 You scramble to your feet.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a swiveling dark gray leather gunner's chair here.
You can go down.

18:00:05 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:00:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

18:50:15 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:50:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Supernova, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

18:50:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:50:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:50:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:50:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:50:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

18:50:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:50:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:50:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:50:42 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Supernova. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:51:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:51:58 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:51:58 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:58:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

18:59:54 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, and a fuzzy stuffed bear here.
You can go south and out.

18:59:55 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "<h"y could have a branch on NQ."

19:00:08 [General Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "They do involve maple syrup."

19:08:10 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

19:08:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, and a fuzzy stuffed bear here.
You can go south and out.

19:08:37 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:08:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:08:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:08:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Supernova, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:08:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:08:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:08:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:08:57 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:09:00 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

19:09:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:09:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:09:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:09:08 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "Supernova, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

[Farport; Docking Bay]
The containing walls of this large but battered docking bay define an octagonal space perhaps one hundred meters in diameter situated on the top of the station, with massive bay doors on the east and west sides. Areas of the deck are marked off with grubby orange duct tape as berths for docked starships. Two freight elevators are built into the bay, one located behind the smaller starships docked on the north side, and another on the southwest side, shiny and new and providing a startling contrast to the aged character of the rest of the bay. The bay itself is rather poorly lit, the overall dim grayness dotted by the bright work lanterns of mechanics and technicians working on docked starships. In the center of the bay is a scarred steel bunker with a sign over its wide hatch reading: 'Station Access.'

19:31:14 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:31:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:31:16 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:31:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Supernova, you have been given clearance to launch.

19:31:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course, give me five or ten minutes."

19:31:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:31:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No problem. I'm on the other side of the skim anyways, but I'm on my way back."

19:32:01 I don't understand that.

19:32:03 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

19:32:03 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

19:37:59 The computer announces, "Skim complete; starship has arrived at journey destination."

19:38:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:38:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:38:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:38:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:38:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:38:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:38:16 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

19:39:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Supernova. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

19:39:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:39:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:39:44 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

19:39:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Give me a few, I'm sorry. I'm not quite ready. Something came up."

20:29:35 Star Conquest Help: Interdiction
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Interdiction is any system which interferes with the navigation of other ships, usually preventing them from orienting themselves in space so that they cannot triangulate a wormhole jump or otherwise leave the sector. Needless to say, keeping a ship in a sector that it would rather leave is often a winning tactic in combat.

Interdictors are most commonly individual devices that are launched into space and emit an interdiction signal. These can simply be targeted and shot by your ship's weapons; their only defense is that there are usually several of them.

Certain advanced starships may possess onboard interdiction. That means the interdiction signal is emitted by the ship itself, and enemy ships will remain trapped in the sector until that ship leaves, is destroyed, or chooses to deactivate interdiction. Such ships are usually encountered only in invasion forces or other particularly strong fleets.

Interdiction is usually used against civilian pilots, but you may discover a means to have interdiction of your own through interacting with the game world.

Whether launching interdictors or using onboard interdiction, the command is INTERDICT.

20:33:09 You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
You can go south, up, and out.

20:33:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:33:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:33:13 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:33:16 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

20:33:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:33:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:33:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:33:29 Which sector did you mean?

Enter your selection:

20:33:33 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Tandem Station. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:33:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:33:34 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

20:33:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:33:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:33:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:33:40 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:33:41 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Tandem Corridor."

20:33:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:33:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:33:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:33:46 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:33:46 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Tandem Station."

20:33:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:33:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:33:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:33:50 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Space Station "Tandem" (Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:33:53 Via general sector communication, Space Station "Tandem" transmits, "Justen Moon, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

20:33:54 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

20:33:56 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

20:34:00 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:34:00 You reset the starship's mileage meter.

20:34:12 You activate the long-range scanner and search for passive detections and recent ping returns.

20:34:12 --
Passive Long-Range Scan
--
No sensor signatures detected. A PING using the active long range scanner may reveal more, but is also likely to reveal your own ship's position.

20:41:59 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

20:41:59 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

20:54:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:54:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:54:31 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:54:34 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Justen Moon! Welcome to home space!"

20:54:45 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

20:54:46 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

20:54:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:55:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can test out my new weapon."

20:55:31 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Two for nest?"

20:55:35 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:55:35 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:55:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Justen Moon. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:55:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:55:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:55:53 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure."

20:55:55 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:55:56 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:55:56 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:56:10 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What suit?"

20:56:27 I don't understand that.

20:56:28 Your ship 'Justen Moon' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:56:37 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "What suits do you have and still need one more."

20:56:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Shule I've got League 2 and 5, Fringe and AEU 3, and Mutie 4."

20:57:15 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok. Still need one more for a nest."

20:58:04 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Will try later, not enough interest."

20:58:15 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hey me."

20:58:29 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, now we have enough."

20:58:47 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "What suits do you have, Ali?"

20:59:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I need 5."

20:59:35 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "League 2, 3, and 5, rental, Eaos, NQ, AEU 5, Mutuality 4 and 5."

21:00:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:56 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hmm."

21:01:12 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Hello all."

21:01:23 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I can switch to anything."

21:02:51 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, Morris bring your League 2, I will bring a Fringe 2, Ali if you can switch to a Fringe 2, then we should be good."

21:03:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Alrighty."

21:03:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Need a moment to switch minimods around."

21:03:19 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Same."

21:03:29 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

21:03:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:03:31 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Airlock]

21:03:31 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:03:31 You exit the ship.

21:03:32 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

21:03:32 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

21:03:33 The three-person light escort "Intense Focus" is landed here.

21:03:38 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Wouldn't rental be better than a Fringe? I can do more damage plus the backup repairs."

21:03:39 [New Earth Spaceport; Aerial Fortresses]

21:03:39 You can go northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

21:03:50 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure."

21:49:15 [Aerial Fortress "Stellar Haven"; Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

21:49:15 The aerial fortress appears to be hovering just inside the entrance of a RATS nest.
You see an AISSF Rental Advanced Combat Armour, a League Infantryman, and Constantine Stone (AEU Light Combatant) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
You rocket through the fortress's entrance hatch and stumble to a stop on the deck.

21:49:18 You hear odd clanking sounds as the aerial fortress begins repairs.

21:49:18 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

21:54:49 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

21:55:00 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:55:00 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:55:04 You hear a loud bang above you somewhere as ship systems are repaired outside.

21:55:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Lidia's Pride. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:55:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:55:14 Morris Corlew lopes south.

21:55:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:55:18 Average Starship Damage: 0%

21:55:18 
Hull damage failsafes remaining: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 97%

21:56:13 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:56:13 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:56:45 Your ship 'Lidia's Pride' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:57:39 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Beacons when I get back?"

21:58:05 [Tactical Communication] Jake Anderson transmits, "Yes please."

21:58:17 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure, how long till you get back?"

21:58:42 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "10 minutes or so."

22:07:42 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "On the way."

22:07:44 [Starship "Lidia's Pride"; Control Room]

22:07:44 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a gold destination finder here.
You can go south and out.

22:07:46 [Starship "Lidia's Pride"; Airlock]

22:07:46 You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:07:47 You exit the ship.

22:07:52 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:07:53 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:07:53 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:07:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:07:54 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:07:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:08:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:08:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:08:06 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

22:08:10 The ship is already moving.

22:08:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:08:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:08:13 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:08:14 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

22:08:17 The computer announces, "Automatic post-launch wormhole jump aborted."

22:08:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:08:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:08:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:08:20 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:08:21 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

22:08:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:08:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:08:25 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:08:28 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:09:22 You exit the ship.
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

22:09:25 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

22:09:26 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Morris Corlew, Melinda Michaels, Jake Anderson, and Nathaniel Owens are standing here.
You can go out.

22:09:32 You wave.

22:09:39 Jake Anderson waves.

22:09:50 Melinda Michaels waves.

22:09:52 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:09:53 Morris Corlew waves.

22:12:08 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

22:13:09 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

22:13:13 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 306".

22:13:51 Jake Anderson removes a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition" from a large package.

22:13:59 Jake Anderson opens a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition".

22:13:59 Jake Anderson begins reading in a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition".

22:15:38 Jake Anderson puts a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition" in a large package.

22:15:57 Jake Anderson puts a large package in a small cloth sack.

22:16:04 Jake Anderson closes a small cloth sack.

22:16:11 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 306" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

22:16:41 Vernos Bailey just arrived.

22:16:50 Morris Corlew waves to Vernos Bailey.

22:16:52 I don't understand that.

22:16:55 You wave to Vernos Bailey.

22:16:57 Vernos Bailey says, "Just wanted to see who was in here."

22:17:05 Nathaniel Owens says, OOCly, "Sec."

22:17:08 Nathaniel Owens yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

22:17:10 You grin at Vernos Bailey.

22:17:15 Jake Anderson says, "Hi."

22:17:32 Vernos Bailey says, "We should do a salvage op."

22:17:40 Vernos Bailey smirks.

22:17:43 Jake Anderson says, "I'm a new cadet nice to meet you""

22:17:51 Melinda Michaels says, "Well."

22:17:56 Melinda Michaels nods to Nathaniel Owens.

22:17:59 Melinda Michaels glances down at her wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

22:18:00 Vernos says to Jake, "Nice to meet you too, I am Vernos."

22:18:10 Jake Anderson says, "Pleasure."

22:20:05 Vernos says to Melinda, "How hard would it be to organize another op week?"

22:20:17 Melinda says to Vernos, "I dunno."

22:20:35 Melinda says to Vernos, "You will get more salvaging outside an op."

22:21:23 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "I will just wait to purchase mine then."

22:21:46 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 306".

22:27:00 Nathaniel says to you, "Yep."

22:27:02 Jake Anderson says, "I know how that can be when you just wake up in your eyes sort of just wander."

22:27:11 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

22:27:18 Jake Anderson says, "I'm ready to do this."

22:27:48 Melinda says to Nathaniel, "You need a ship?"

23:15:53 You peer north...

23:15:53 
[Starship "Morning Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, a decoy beacon launcher, a glossy lavender ceramic felo chow bowl, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Business Cats", and Turbo the arachnoid security robot here.

At least one recently active pilot is relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

23:23:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:23:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:23:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:23:10 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.

23:23:13 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

23:23:13 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

23:23:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:23:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:23:31 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:23:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:23:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:23:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:23:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Must do industry for battery...ugh so much industry."

23:23:51 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:23:54 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:23:54 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:24:26 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:25:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Industry is the grease on the great engine of the AEU."

23:26:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I heartily disagree with that statement."

23:26:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

23:26:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Techinally we should be leaders in exploration."

23:26:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true."

23:27:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Still though, the alliance needs us doing industry work."

23:29:20 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:29:21 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

23:29:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, I thought it was 200."

23:29:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh well."

23:29:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Could be 200."

23:30:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Check the torus xenology center."

23:30:15 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:30:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:30:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ok, I will."

23:30:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks."

23:30:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:30:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:30:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I hope it is 200, I am starting to hate shipwrecks."

23:30:34 The ship is already moving.

23:30:35 The ship is already moving.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

Star Conquest Help: Exploration
--
Category: Activities
--
Exploration, in terms of activities, is simply the act of venturing into uncharted space and discovering artifacts, abandoned space stations, and objects of that nature. In the wider sense, exploration is the act of making entirely new discoveries: unique structures in space, previously unknown human settlements, and perhaps even new alien species.

An explorer's career can begin upon achieving 300 industry points, purchasing an AutoVector unit, and looking for relatively intact debris from before or during the Outsider War. From there, there is a progression of ever more exotic and distant artifacts and things to explore.

Making entirely new discoveries is something completely different; it requires careful planning, good roleplaying, and contact with the staff, usually invoking Policy 14: Minievents. Each new discovery is something truly unique and requires new designs and new writing from the staff.

If you wish for your character to make unique discoveries, you should first lay the groundwork. Does your character concept describe an explorer, or someone who would be more content with staying nearby and making money? Have you played your character as someone with the curiosity to make new discoveries? If your character has been more of a homebody, you should start by simply exploring with the resources available. Take some trips in the vicinity of local
23:39:25  space for the joy of it. Travel to some of the nearby known destinations. Travel straight out for a couple of hundred lightyears, traveling through the night, then come back. None of these things require staff involvement, and by spending some time gradually establishing your character as one with curiosity and a drive to explore, you will have a character more likely to receive serious staff attention in an exploration endeavor. A character who has made a career of sitting in a mining center but who suddenly wants to discover aliens 3,000 light-years away seems far less plausible than a character who has already been exploring at every opportunity who has the same end goal. Remember, Christopher Columbus was on the sea all his life -- he didn't suddenly give up a career as a sedentary banker in Genoa and stumble straight into America.

If your character is an established explorer and has a sensible goal, the next step is to plan. New discoveries aren't made on a day trip -- you must plan to push the limits of your ship. How much battery time does your ship have? How are you going to recharge it? Who is your crew? Do they have the skills you will need for a successful journey? How far do you plan to go? How are you going to navigate? What is your backup plan? If you can answer all of these questions and have a properly prepared ship and crew, you may be ready to make a new unique discovery.

At some point in this proces
23:39:25 s, you should contact the staff about your minievent. Policy 14 applies to events such as these, and the staff are more likely to be interested in your proposal if the following things are true: 1) Your character has been roleplayed well and with consistency. 2) You are including many characters -- a full house aboard, not just the two or three people you normally interact with. 3) You have provided us with a sensible goal for your character. 4) You are not attempting to dictate what you find. For example, your character may wish to make an expedition 2,000 light-years Coreward, which makes perfect sense, and the staff are free to determine what you might find there. If you begin specifying that you want to find an alien race after 1,000 lightyears with unique laser technology that lets you snipe enemy ships from one sector away and so on and so on, then we are more likely to turn the whole thing down. Give us your character's goals and wishes, not the exact plot you wish to happen.

And, finally, follow through. Of the players who have made a complete plan for new exploration, only a minority of those have actually gotten a crew together and left the docking bay. This results in wasted work by everyone.

So, in brief, if your character is a well-roleplayed character with an established curiosity for the unknown, if he or she has sensible goals, and if he or she wishes to maximize inclusion by having a full crew instead of his or her usual tiny circle of friends, then you may wish to ask the staff via the SUPPORT command whether it is a good time for your character to explore and make a new discovery. Note that, because a unique discovery often requires a great deal of work on our part, often on a deadline, it is not something we can do every week. A successful discovery often gets other players thinking about heading out immediately to make discoveries for their own characters, but the truth is, after rushing to complete something unique, we often want a month or three of downtime and working on other projects before we do something like that again. If a major discovery has just been made, take some time to consolidate it -- return to it, explore around it, get to know the area. After some time has passed, it may be time for someone else to make a new discovery.

If you have any questions about these concepts, please use the SUPPORT command to discuss it with the staff.

23:39:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "AISING!"

23:40:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aisling, your lack of a response is forcing me to work. This is unacceptable."

23:43:48 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Go Aisling. Keep it up then."

23:44:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Come on, I work too hard as it is."

23:45:26 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:45:26 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

23:46:23 [Tactical Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "My bad."

23:46:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ather, there is one change I am not makin. I'm not spoon feedin folks where to buy one ship cheaper than the other. If they wanna check that out, they're free to."

23:53:51 There appear to be about 19 pilots recently active.
