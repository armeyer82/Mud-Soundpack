-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, Purr the humanoid
service robot, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a compact
red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, a blue plastic food
storage container, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

The ship is not moving.
caress lily on back
You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.
A medium-sized semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils
and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS
Defender.
squeeze lily
You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.
Lily Kaise smiles at you.
smile lily
You smile at Lily Kaise.
Lily gently rubs your back and strokes your hair.
-lily You know I'll always love you. No matter what.
You say to Lily, "You know I'll always love you. No matter what."
"I'm so glad and I'll always lov e you too." Lily Kaise beams at you. "I don't
know what you could ever do to make me stop loving you."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I'll always love you too."
beam lily
You beam at Lily Kaise.
-lily About the only think you could do is cheat  on me repeatedly. I'd probably
walk away then. But I know you'd never do that.
You say to Lily, "About the only think you could do is cheat on me repeatedly.
I'd probably walk away then. But I know you'd never do that."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I guess if you murdered someone and it
wasn't out of self-defense or robbed or did what the old times used to call sins
or those things called the ten commandments. I would still love you but I know
it would likely cause me to question a lot."
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I don't htink you ever would though. You
are too kind."
wrap lily
You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.
Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.
kiss lily on lips
You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok let's go watch that silly station."
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
'ok
You say, "Ok."
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I never transferred the module on it so
hope I didn't screw things up for us."
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Woo."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
XG?aT?bsf;1P_"^SBu&/ArsB%D3F.2HDUcQv=fxs
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Yay it worked too!"
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

hated you, I wouldn't banter with you."

know."

about?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, Tabi is trying to teach
me to be nice to women. Which apparently means lying to them all the time. Like
telling them they look beautiful when they actually don't."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm trying to figure that
out."

ugly, don't lie about it."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Same goes for men."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I tried to tell him that! He

no matter what to her significant other. Maybe not so much a lie."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "And other way around."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I know what you mean,
Aisling. But, I wouldn't want him telling me I look gorgeous, when he honestly
thinks otherwise."

thinks? Maybe he does."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Does this spacesuit make me
look fat?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Take him at his word."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Trust is important yes?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Of course. What I mean
though, is that I wouldn't want him to say something he doesn't mean, to make me
feel good."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And yes, Johann, you look as
huge as black sand tower."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I understand. But you must
take him at his word."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Sweet!"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Unless you are trying to
trap him."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Like wearing dead felo
costume and asking if you look beautiful."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh hell. That's just..."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I heard of costume from last
year."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's not even right."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It was apparently a thing."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's nasty."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It was probably Ather."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh, I just remembered. I was
hearing half of the conversation over the hypercasters, yesterday. Did you guys
still need help sorting the beast in orion?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I spoke to Akemi last
evening about this."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well, last evening, then."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "We are going to wait to
rebuilt until artifacting crew returns."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "However we may put up a xeno
station for now."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Tonight possibly."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ah, okay. All good, I just
figured I'd check, because as Morris said, I do have all the keys that we'd
need."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "I don't have any keys!"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "There is not enough active
pilots to really keep it going."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Which is why it went down."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "So we will make temporarily
xeno station as I know Johann wishes to use."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah, that makes sense.
Though you do have 2 of the most active salvagers back now."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Yeah, but no hurry, I won't be
done at the bubble for another 120 artifacts."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "They will not be gone for so
long."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "How is the station at 777?
Does it exist, or no?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "They said they arrived only
yesterday. So I expect about 30 cycles or so."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "It does exist."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Lily rebuilt."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Fucking glory to Lily for
that! Yes!"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I am not a huge hugger, but
I'd near on crush the life out of her for that."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Please do."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Uh, well...I want her to
live. I only meant it as a figure of speech."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Oh."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

Star Conquest Help: Starship Amenities
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Starships possess a few minor amenities to make long trips bearable!
SHIP'S HEAD
First of all, are you out in deep space and you really need to "go"? Never fear!
All starships have a ship's head! It's conveniently located in the storage room,
simply because there is no good place to put such a thing.
Ship's heads also possess a first aid kit for use in emergencies. These are kept
stocked automatically by alliance spaceports.
LIVING QUARTERS
Living quarters are the center of most amenities, logically! Living quarters are
typically found on larger ships, and tend to be centrally attached to a "hub"
room. This hub will possess a tiny, single shower that you can GO into. It has
the usual START and STOP commands.
Also in the hub, you may CLAIM a living quarters if you have a key to the ship.
This will lock a living quarters so that only you may enter it! If you wish to
give up your room, you may UNCLAIM it later.
If you own the ship, you may OVERRIDE a living quarters lock from the hub in
order to forcibly unclaim it.
Once inside the living quarters, you may ALLOW anyone you brought with you to
also be able to get past the lock. If you change your mind, you can DISALLOW a
person.

This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small
sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some
effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be
completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several
grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. The status
lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows,

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, you wouldn't be able to

[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "How much?"
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then

out a system long ago for this!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Even though it will never come
to pass, I was bored."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Goodness."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It seems here that I would
charge 150 million credits for every 50 points."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That is disappointingly low."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Still, you'd have to pay about
9.6 billion."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Best calculation."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "You are correct. At the

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Now, I could show general
grandness and compassion of robot ace pilot, since you're a frequent customer
and charge you only 100 million credits per 50 belt management points."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That'd slash the price down to
6 billion and change."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I cannot take your points
anyway."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "But I could afford that."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well yes, you see, but it was a
system I worked out long ago. I was bored."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Why do you just not collect
your points?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I am needing combat of space
and ground more than industry at moment anyway."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Mainly because there is really
no industrial goal that I really am striving for. I mean, all that's left to me
is the last mighty grapple, which I would most likely never use anyway. So, I'm
going to maybe wait until the station has like 5000 points in it before I
collect them."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I can help you with space
combat with mighty flare!"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Later we can maybe."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Might even just say screw it
and run midnight beacon drops if there's enough interest."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I will not be available to
do that at midnight Probably."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Maybe."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "0030 could work."

concrete foundation for my plans anyway."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Why not run missions from
Accord?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I suppose I could do that. It
would depend on how much interest we could muster up."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "True."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Frigate or more, I could do
missions instead of beacon drops. Heck, I'll do them in a pulsar, too."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

Shule,
I know Tatiana Krupin will seek you out now after our last two exchanges. I am
copying in my final post to her below. Although I won't go out of my way to
approach her, one aspect that she needs to accept is that she is not permitted
to silence our outrage. If she can speak out, so should we be able to. I also
wasn't harrassing her but applying peer pressure but it's without a doubt that
she is beyond reason. I know too that you must be careful in your own approach
with Krupin but as a peer, I can certainly express what I want and I have. If I
were in your position, for professional reasons, I certainly would have to
phrase differently. If you do ask her to resign it should likely be moreso that
you remind her of our positions as holding a leadership role and how her own
conduct is also scrutinized by other alliances and that our respective behavior
can and will affect diplomatic relations. Of course this is up to you and you
know exactly how to word it. If I wer her though, I'd much prefer to resign than
to have the whole of AEU civilian pilots voting against me. This obviously
doesn't phase her though. It's very surreal that reality simply does not
register with this woman.
This is my very last post to Krupin -
Tatiana Krupin, I daresay that you have far more to deal with concerning your
own reputation and behavior than I ever will. The reason why I disliked you
early on was for behavior and arrogance exactly like what you just exonerated
through your recent actions. I am a reasonable person and if, for a moment, I
felt that your case was valid, I would be supportive and this would be
regardless of my own opinion of you. i believe in justice and your attempts to
effect unfounded injustice towards our own who have endured far more than you
could ever imagine, worked hardest for us, discovered wonders and are the very
core of our Core vallue. You are truly a poor excuse for a human being and for
your dishonorable abuse. You will indeed pay for your offenses against civilian
pilots. I promise to be there to cheer on the judges. I shall speak to you
whenever I so desire as well. You cannot silence me nor can anyone. I'll likely
not waste my time with writing to you further however as you are beyond
worthwhile of my time and effort.

Shule, I'm sitting on the couch in the Control Room of William Dove. I have
Magellan, Sassie on a leash and a hoverpallet following me. I put the aquariums
onto the hoverpallet. please put the bed on the hoverpallet as well. I'd prefer
not to take William Dove to old Earth and it be there for all that long but if
you forget and take us there, it's ok. If you have any extra felo chow bowls or
troughs, please bring them along with any fish food you have or felo chow. I
have put an extra bag of chow in Maria Mitchell who is in your ship and I did a
felo feeding from the Repair shop so your felo will be taken care of. Purr is
setup with 4 bags of chow plus the fish food it has in case an aquarium is left
behind. please take a look around in William Dove and pick up anything you see
that I might have overlooked. The last thing I need to do is pick up some food
to bring. please bring any that you have time to get. I should be back no later
than 2300 and can easily pickup food. I'm just planning for contingencies in

Hey Lily,
I know this might not seem like much, but I wanted to thank you personally for
putting up that beacon, and trying to help all of us out.
Personally, sure, I'm beyond grade thirty shipwrecks too, but there's still
plenty of points to be had, and honestly, they're something different to
salvage.
I'm sorry to, that people went in on you like that on the boards.
I totally understand you were just trying to help people out, and while sure,
using station parts without checking first isn't always a great plan, it's not
like you hurt anyone in doing so.
I suppose I can see why some orgs are a little upset, but please, don't take it
on board and let it affect any future testing, or ideas you may have.
Sometimes, I think people forget that if it weren't for you and Shule, allot of
station work wouldn't get done. You deserve to be appreciated more for it.
Anyway, please know that I support what you did, with the ability that I have,
even being a trustee of spatial stability.
Please accept a written hug, and my appreciation, yet again for stepping out,
and trying to do something for people.
Eve.

During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived
at Famous Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long
time since we drifted off course en route and it required about
another day to get our bearings and to correct our course. When
melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would likely want
to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back
in Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to
prepare a written statement as well albeit I didn't ask permission
to do so but I really wasn't given the time to ask very many
questions.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda into the Control Room of the ship and the
exchange began like this. I asked? 'so Melinda do you have a
letter from Nissi?
Melinda Michaels says. "I do not, she is, um, unavailable."
Melinda then says, "So we are running without either voice
currently."
I nodd to Melinda.
I then asked Melinda? 'so who did she appoint to act on her
behalf?
"She did not appoint anybody," Melinda says. "I took it upon myself
to come out here and make sure you guys knew."
I then said to Melinda. 'well first off, I want to thank you for
your efforts in traveling out here.
Melinda next said. "Since she is not available, I will probably
take it upon myself to send whatever letters are needed," Melinda
says. "Somebody has to."
I then went further to state. 'Second, I want to express that i am
very troubled by the news. However, do consider that crime happens
to all citizens of all alliances.
'I am not happy with what has occurred.
Melinda then nodded in agreement.
I then said to Melinda. 'Still, I am not the Military. I am not
the aEU Government. My job is to be a messenger to our Government
Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and nothing more.
I added with another question? 'So too, did Ather Jammoa send you
here?
"Nobody sent me," says Melinda.
I then said. 'ok well Akemi was acting rather hysterical saying
that I was wanted back there so I'm just trying to understand who
wants me back there.
Melinda, obviously not hearing my question says. "You are the
voice," says Melinda, "troubling times are at hand and here I am."
Melinda says, "We want some kind of word, people are getting
upset."
I responded with. 'yes but if our government felt I should be
there, they have the means to dispatch that request to me. I
informed them before I left of my plans as well.
Melinda asked the following which I hoped would be a good faith
effort on her part to convey my need for clarification. "So," asks
Melinda, "this is what you want me to tell people if they ask?"
She cut me off you see as I wasn't finished with what I had to say
which was. 'Even if i were there, I am not the party who can
control the behavior of aEU citizens.
Melinda says, "Of course you can't."
She continued with. "So, since you weren't asked for in an
official capasity, you will remain on said trip," Melinda says. "Is
this correct?"
I concurred by saying. 'well it's very much out of my hands. They
need to understand that it's not within my power to control AEU
Citizens. It is our government's responsibility to deal with those
issues. You can certainly convey to them in o uncertain terms that
I am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical over-
emphasis on the partof the media and related to recent elections no
doubt.
Melinda says, "Okay I will do this."
Melinda says, "All right."
Melinda Michaels then stood up to leave without repeating anything
back to me as well as she didn't let me finish what I was saying.
I just went on by stating. 'If I were back there, there really
isn't anything I could do.
Melinda then says, "I just hope nobody else dies."
She still wasn't allowing me to complete my statement. so I went
on to say. 'AEU pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to
me as well.. "That's fine," says Melinda.
Melinda says, "I tried."
'Thank you for doing so.
Melinda waved. Then she says, o very unceremoniously, Melinda
says, "Yup."
Melinda says, "Later."
I waved back rather amazed that she seemed both not interested in
what I was trying to gather from the scant information I had as
well as nothing official from the leadership from the league nor
Ather Jammoa or from any other AEU pilot back in Comms.
Melinda Michaels then rather rudely walked out. There is certainly more that I
would like to have discussed or to have asked if I could prepare a written
statement or even asked for a brief period of time to consider a request which
didn't come to me in an official capacity. Still, I would have. I took time to
consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the AEU
seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann in
his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went on
to Tom Town to charge overnight. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship
was charge onto Sea of Fears the next day. After a rather sleepless night, when
I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and very
apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at Sea of
Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better grasp of
the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann was very
gracious and he
said that he understood my concerns and that we could return to
Comms. Since there was no other means aboard Johann's Galleon to
communicate that we were returning, it is unfortunate that a hasty
decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf. I further find
it regretable that Melinda was in so much of a hurry not to allow
me to prepare a written statement which I couldn't have prepared
before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on. I apologize
to you all though as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation was
in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the plans
of
others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that Ather
Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't have
hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison office.

Date November 17, 2316
Dear Mr. Lambeth,
I am providing a statement to you below which concerns my interactions with
Melinda Michaels after she arrived on Famous Andy's Trading Post whereby she
demanded my return to Comms. In addition, i want to share my own perspective and
that I never absolutely refused to return to Comms.
I am very sympathetic to others and especially when the news related such
horrific crimes towards humanity, why, then didn't any of our own pilots support
this? It seems that they only did so when it became apparent that it was a
problem for the AEU and i didn't act immediately on Melinda Michael's request.
Also, i want to point out to you that Kim Saunders who you have just appointed
as Voice of the Corps, yesterday evening, related confidential information which
was posted on our AEU Debate board over the General Channel concerning what I
wrote. Kim Saunders often confides in Melinda Michaels and others from the
League rather than to her own allies. How can we possibly trust someone who is
going to discuss every communication or otherwise which transpires on the AEU
message boards or over the AEU communications channel? Since I'm not able to do
so, I hope your office will, remind AEU pilots of the confidential nature
regarding AEU business and other issues is and how it is to be treated
confidentially and not shared outside of the AEU Pilot Corps. I certainly
thought that this related to what is posted on the message boards within the
AEU, discussions which take place on the aEU communications Channel as well as
during meetings and other exchanges which are specific to the AEU Pilot Corps.
Thank you and please see below.
During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived at Famous
Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long time since we drifted off
course en route and it required about another day to get our bearings and to
correct our course. When melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would
likely want to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back in
Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to prepare a written
statement to send back via Melinda Michaels. However, I didn't get the
opportunity to ask permission to do so. I also really wasn't given time to ask
very many questions. After Melinda Michaels abruptly exited the Galleon, she
went to the Bar and so I also went to the bar. Just as I was about to ask her if
she would consider discussing the situation further with me as well as I also
wanted to prepare something in writing, she bought food and then said her
goodbyes.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda Michaels into the Control Room of the ship and the exchange
proceeded. I asked? "so Melinda do you have a letter from Nissi?" Melinda
Michaels says, "I do not, she is, um, unavailable." Melinda then says, "So we

Melinda? "so who did she appoint to act on her behalf?" "She did not appoint

time to consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the
AEU seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann
in his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went
on to Tom Town to charge overnight and Johann obtained an upgrade for his
Galleon. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship was charge onto Sea of
Fears the next day. I still tried to understand why I hadn't heard anything from
the AEU. There were too many unanswered questions. After a rather sleepless
night, when I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and
very apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at
Sea of Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better
grasp of the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann
was very gracious and he said that he understood my concerns and that we could
return to Comms. There was also no other means aboard Johann's Galleon in the
way of a Quantum Entanglement Device to communicate that we were returning. It
is unfortunate that a hasty decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf as
I had every intention to do my job. I just felt that the League were controlling
things without the AEU's involvement. I further find it regretable that Melinda
was in so much of a hurry not to allow me to prepare a written statement which I
couldn't have prepared before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on.
I apologize to you, as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation
was in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the
plans of others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that
Ather Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't
have hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison
office.
As you can see, I never directly said that I wouldn't return. I didn't say a lot
to Johann Rowan because if his being a member of the League, there were certain
aspects which I didn't consider that he should be privy to. From my own personal
perspective. I'm not insensitive to other individuals from other alliances but
it seemed rather odd that the League were so intent on me when their own
leadership isn't performing. I so wish that Ather Jammoa would have at least
sent a statement or a request via the Hyperwave which we tried to monitor during
the times they can be typically used to transmit from the Torus. I was also not
aboard my own ship and didnt feel that i had total control over another pilot's
vessel. Johann Rowan was, however very gracious and did openly indicate that it
was my judgement call to return or not. Therefore, he is not to blame for the
delay.
I want to state that I deplore any and all acts of intimmidation, violance,
destruction of property or otherwise harm that has been inflicted upon any
individual, regardless of which Alliance, clan or where they are from. If those
acts which i have read about in the news are verifiable as a true representation
of fact, I urge the AEU to take immediate actions to seekout, prosecute and
punish those involved. No matter what has been expressed of others, I do not
hate nor wish any harm to be directed towards any human being from any part of
this universe. The AEU must absolutely uphold a zero tolerance to crimes against
humanity or any living being for that matter.

[Starship "Anzio"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.
