00:08 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Anyways, I'm out. Thanks for the missions"

00:08 You deftly insert a stun turret into a soft black leather stun weapon holster.

00:08 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black stun armor storage bag, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a red leather artifact storage container, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit navigational computer, a red spacesuit jet, a red archaeological artifact storage container, and a level five archaeological dig site scanner.

00:09 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:09 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:09 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:09 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Busy."

00:09 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:09 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:09 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

00:09 You lean forward in a brown leather recliner.

00:09 You stand up.

00:16 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Kitty to Tibo - 8-6-2363]

My Dearest Love,
First off, I haven't had a link with Fawkes in literally months.
As for Cria, I rarely have spoken with him with the very rare
chance that I am on HiGuard for a mission. This has been probably
a couple of months ago. So do not! accuse me of kissing anybody's
butt Tibo. I just try to get along with them by not being caustic
or hostile and sometimes just plain old avoidance is what you have
to do. I truly don't think though that I am safe around any of
them and I'm sure they will likely try to take advantage of me when
they have the opportunity to do so. I don't know why too you would
even imply that i bother to pay anyone to cause you any harm. I
don't work that way and especially towards someone i love as much
as i love you. The only time I will go aggressive towards anyone
is when they have first attacked me. Even then, I generally just
move on as it's not worth the aggrevation until I find that
individual when they least expect it and return by breaking their
bones! Then I owe them absolutely nothing and being nice isn't my
plan! Otherwise, as you know, I'd rather make love than war as I
so want to make love with you.
I will tell you though that you have a bit of manning up to do and
I know you don't like it but still, when others see one flying
around in a gunship, their assumption is and always will be that
they are wanting to fight or at least are able to defend their
starship. Believe me if you want to but I have had enough years of
having my bones broken, ships stolen, attempts at extortion and
blown up ships to decide that I am not going to be a prisoner in my
ship, etc unless I have other reasons for not coming out. When I
am able to work, I go about my business and I face the consequences
of whatever is in my path. I am not the combat pilot I used to be
so I know I can't defend a gunship as I once could so guess what, I
choose not to fly a ship around which costs a few billion credits.
That makes no sense! I'd rather lose one which I have 100
million invested in which is more expendable as it is a hostile
Universe out there and is not likely to ever change. So your
stating you got shot at in your Expediter comes across as whining.
Hey you sure have a short memory when it comes to things.
remember one of my own Expediters launched right into a mine field.
That same Expediter was shot at several times but did it stop me
when I was more active? I was just angry concerning how very new
pilots who only had a few credits earned were in the line of fire.
I just would either accept my loss and go buy another one or use
one I have in reserve as I keep a few. I can tell you lots of
stories of being entrapped and other things but it's no reason to
blame the universe for all of my problems. People respect you
moreso when you at least try to look at your own actions and decide
to just
00:16  keep doing what you do and to accept the consequences or
use a different strategy. This is probably why you have been
called a coward and no I didn't hear this from Cria or Fawkes
because I absolutely do not communicate with them privately. Nope.
So love, I don't think you deserve any sympathy over your losses
based upon poor judgement. Nobody has given me any except to
perhaps offer to sell me another ship which I may or may have not
accepted. I am sorry for your losses but not still for what I
consider chosing the wrong time of day to go out of locals. Still,
rather than hold yourself accountable all I heard in your letter
was blame this one and blame that one and nothing about hey what
could have i done to evade them or to choose a time to depart or to
not let anyone know when I was leaving/ You know I never tell
anybody what my plans are either and I I showed you measures which
I hope you observed en route. There are pilots whose sport is to
challenge anyone who will to combat. Although it is inconvenient
to us, that's their sport and when you take it personally, this
just feeds their egos. Haven't you heard Anton challenging others
before? For him, it's fun and although you don't see it that way
and I find it to be a royal pain in the butt, that is how it is.
so i certainly understand wanting to take a stronger ship into
Sector 12 if there is an Invasion but there is also the ITPN
particularly when there is that much hostile activity in the
sector. A good practice too is that BCs should actually be taken
to Jump Hub or another neutral location as well to crew but isn't
always done. So don't point fingers at me! I'm trying to relate
some practical survival advice to you yet you always seem to resent
it when someone like myself has had a bit of life and survival
experience and your not wanting to accept and to listen will not
help you much. only you can decide that perhaps there are others
who do know something based upon real experience.
As for the exact circumstances of your lost gunship, still, you
need to step back and get off of the defensive and accept it that
you indeed made tactical errors. That if others such as myself
consider how you mis-managed things don't agree with you, then that
is how it is. It does not mean that I love you any less. However,
I'm not very impressed with the logic behind what you have done at
times. You have lost two gunships in less than a half a year. I
sympathize with the loss of your droids as that was just a mean-
spirited thing on the part of that jerk.
As I have told you before, going to a commonly hunted ground out of
37 is not wise. If you do so, then you need to be willing to take
on the adversities. It is unfortunate but it is just a reality of
being a pilot in this universe. Nobody promised us that we would
live a perfect life here without any challenges.
As for going out of locals, you know I don't do that to run away
but because i enjoy it. still, others perception of you is when
you are angry or upset, that is what you do. As it's typical of
others who are newer pilots and don't engage in pilot versus pilot
combat. I'm not saying you should, just what is the perception
right or wrong.
You know exactly why I choose to go where nobody else goes to
Aquatic, Atmo and Gas salvage. Although it would be fun to be in a
community setting, it's just asking to be attacked so why put
yourself in that position? It's like here I am boys and girls!
come get me! That makes no sense at all! However, if you can
defend your ship and resources, then go where you want to go and be
ready to fight if you have to.
You need to remind yourself exactly why I wanted to take you out of
Locals as it was to enjoy some quality time with you and to not
have any interference so that we could make an attempt to work out
our differences.
Since I had so little quality time withyou until you ran off with
that self-serving individual who yes, how hypocritical, is not
available as much as i was and am. You said she was right by your
side heh well after what 4 days she hasn't been right there by your
side? So a very unfounded justification to hold over my head. I
might have been away for a day or so but I always came right back
to be right there with you. On many occasions, I would be
available for you and wait for at least an hour or two for you to
come home and then it seemed convenient that you wanted me to
become more intimate when you well knew I would sleep soon. It
makes me wonder if it's you who didn't want to take the time to
become more intimate. Still Love, I'd truly like to know what it
would be like to make love with you.
As for supporting you and upholding your dignity, then you will
always have every ounce of my very being to support you if I truly
know that you are using your head and reasonable judgement. Then
you are dignified and deserve to be respected. If you were still
here so I could be by your side, yes I would fight for you but I
nor anyone can't fight battles over circumstances that you created.
You know that I was not in favor of your joining Insanity but you
did so without even discussing it and I suppose had you done so
and I opposed it, that you would have just stomped out angrily,
slammed the door and then perhaps I could just say 'I told you so'.
You know I was initially tempted to join but thought better of it
as I knew that all they would want to do would be to exploit me.
That is one thing that Matt never did to me nor anyone in Force.
He didn't like families and cliques either although couples were
ok. He had some very sound ideas and he did not exploit anyone but
one thing about Matt which was of utmost importance is loyalty. I
did not get the sense that Cria or Fawkes cared anything about
loyalty which is another reason I did not choose to join. I will
likely remain as a member of Force until it is gone or if Matt
comes back and a group of great pilots and a few pirates band
together once again.
So sorry my sweet love, love is tough at times and it should be
because if I continuously supported certain aspects, then how do
you consider this to help you out? It is what they call enabling.
That is not support. Still, if Ihappened to be flying with you and
you were under attack, I wouldn't just sit back and let it happen
to you. If you are implying that I can do anything about Cria and
Fawkes, well sorry Love, I'm in no better circumstances than you.
I know that ifever i let my guard down, they will find a way to
take advantage. When they do though, I will either find a means to
retaliate which is highly unlikely or accept the consequences and
reflect and consider what I should do and defintiely should do
different to prevent a reoccurance of the same circumstances. I
may not succeed but there is nobody to blame but myself for
creating a situation for myself which left me vulnerable. I
wouldn't blame you as you are so hurtfully are blaming me for your
problems. I am accountable to Kitty and if someone loves her and
is available to help her then she is forever grateful. If they
aren't or choose not to, then I don't hold it against them.
You have a lot of potential tibo and I do have a lot of respect and
faith in you but you won't go forward by continuing to wallow in
your current state of self-pity. I find it very sad too as I so
want you to stand proudly and not take on the role of a stupid
victim.
I will love you forever for you though even though you have gone
out of your way to be cruel to me for circumstances which are
seemingly now more apparent but which I have had absolutely no
control over nor involvement in. I will swear it on every star in
this universe that I have never done anything to cause any harm to
you. I don't treat a man I love or anyone I love in such a manner
as that.
I love you.
Your forever faithful,
Kitty

My Dearest Love,
Well it is so hard to write letters like this. We really need to be face to face and talk things over. I know that we have both made a lot of assumptions because you ended things so abruptly without even talking with me this is what started this chain of awfulness.
Please my Love, please do not end your career until we have at least gotten together in person to talk face to face. You owe it to yourself and I should honestly pray to the stars that you would think that I'm worth it.
Yes, take that woman back to where she belongs and then i'll be waiting for you.
I will be more than happy to accompany you to go back out of locals if this is what you want to do to earn funds to replace things or whatever but ew must please, we must get together face to face. writing letters does not convey the proper tone nor expression and it's not fair to either of us not to try.
I love you and will forever and there will be no other man for me.
I love you,
Kitty

My dearest Love,
Well it has likewise come the time for me to tell you that if you were telling me the truth all along, then you wouldn't truly be a coward that you are being and leave piloting. Yes you cheated with a cheater so you got what you truly deserved now. I hope I never find your mistress alone as now I will truly get revenge for destroying as she obviously has or you would come back to me. She has brainwashed you so horribly as well. You wer cheating on me before that night that you faked a breakup with me to try to cover yourself. You obviously had contact with her and a plan to move in. That is cheating as who knows how long and then you moved in with her in some other man's home. That is so disgusting and so disrespectful of the spirit and to the owner of the property especially if it is a boyfriend or former boyfriend.
So either come back to me and face me or be on your way Tibo Beauchene or the memory I will have of you will be only of a cheater who wouldn't admit to his wrongs, a coward who wouldn't hold himself accountable for his stupid mistakes in judgement and obviously one who couldn't encourage a decent woman like me to trust him and consumate her love with you. At least i was correct in that you would prove yourself untrustworthy.
I did offer to forgive you and to make an effort to be with you one on one to work out our differences. Cowards only run and hide behind their broken promises and lies though rather than face those whom they have hurt.
I always felt that you were hiding something and I know now that you are just a user whom i obviously couldn't resist so that is my fault for allowing it. If you weren't, you would be back in my arms. I suppose there is some remote glint of guilt on your behalf there because you are so compeled to run away and throw your career away rather than admit to your wrongs and apologize to me.
You lashed out at me for your problems too which means you still can't see through your own lack of accountability. I am the one you can trust though but it's so painful that you would blame me rather than admit it that you yourself are responsible for your failures.
it's sad for you Tibo Beauchene and my heart will miss you forever but we pilots certainly don't need another dishonest cheater amongst us women who only desire a good and honest companion. I wanted to marry you and I still do but my intuition told me I should wait and I am so right that you haven't the decency to face me.
I will say to you one last time, that the door is still open and especially for you to come back to me and prove that I am wrong. One other thing Tibo though is you are to show me that you are truly a man of integrity. You will also cease blaming me for what others do to you as well. You know Tibo,you just don't realize who your friends truly are as well and especially that I am not a cheater like Miriam Val
00:17 leris who cheted on her boyfriend to break us up. If you come back to me, I will leave her to her miserable life sleeping around with any man she wants though. She truly has the blackest heart and soul as she has no comprehension of guilt for the destruction in her path.
I will be sad forever Tibo and I may never get over it if you don't come back and at least try to work things out with me. Still, if you won't, I can't blame myself for your turning your back on me and running away to cover your wrongs.
I still love you with my heart because true love never dies.
Kitty

00:20 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Kitty to Tibo - 10-3-2363]

Dear Tibo,
As for your predicament, I'm sorry that you can't manage the
Transverser out there. Now you know why that although I love that
ship, unless you have at least a crew of 4, that you really can't fight
major praelor without incurring a lot of damage because of how
difficult it is to multi-room. It's hard to manage ammunition too
because if you've only got a crew of one or two, then you'll rely too
much on bard and run out rather quickly. So this is why I prefer the
Gunship and with the Slip and Subwarp enhancements that I qualify for,
the speed of the ship is all but that of the Transverser with the
exception of not having waveqarp of course which is the Transverser's
crowning glory. I can outrun a lot in Mischief with Navi or anywhere
and of course it's a very solid ship. Still solo, even though I can
manage it pretty well, unless I have at least another crew, it's
vulnerable. Therefore, I'm not coming out to rescue you alone and I
don't want Valleris aboard any ship I own as I absolutely do not trust
her so she would be required to remain in your ship if I bring any ship
of mine to fetch your ship.
There are a couple of options I'll present which you probably won't
like. However, it's all that I can think of at the moment.
1. Escape with the individual you have aboard as grouped with you and
we can go back for your Transverser but she is not welcome.
2. If I could get the assistance of Cally and Mikey, we could bring
Mischief out to get your Transverser. I wouldn't expect either of them
to offer their Battlecruisers so it would be up to them. The issue
with this is I don't know what your trust level is with them at this
point as well as I am not certain if they will want to work with me to
rescue you given they aren't happy with how you treated me. The
converse is do you trust me enough to tell the Calaways. I was
thinking that when you let me know your galactic coordinates, that I
would try to not tell them directly until we were a number of sectors
out of FTL range. I do hope you know that you can trust me and that I
will never divulge where you are to anyone unless you explicitly tell me who you would trust knowing them.
3. As a last resort, you can self-destruct and return to comms and
work hard to recoup your losses. I personally would not like to see
this happen though.
Thank you for your letter. I so appreciate it that you've finally
apologized and much more. Since this comes as quite a shock, i'll be
honest and tell you that I don't know exactly how I feel at this time.
I'm certainly not trying to imply that I don't want to talk things
over. I've just been trying to shutdown emotionally. I can't tell you
that I don't miss you either and how I would prefer more than anything
that we are able to mend our relationship. I'm willing to try though.
Kitty

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, and a transparent architectural de
00:22 sign simulator here.
You can go south and out.

00:22 You should stand up first.

00:50 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

00:50 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:50 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

00:50 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Eden" and the one-person cargo hauler "Debris Collector" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Incredulous Incredibility" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, Carlie the
00:51  droid, Kirsty the droid, Slap the droid, a stun trap, Mohammid the droid, Carmine the droid, Groot the droid, Chi the droid, Andreas the droid, Kaiti the droid, Hannah the droid, Michae the droid, Sia the droid, Susan the droid, Arielabear the droid, Rain the droid, Rayne the droid, Pizzelle the droid, SnoopCat the droid, JessiePops the droid, and Bethan the droid here.
You can go north, east, southeast, southwest, west, and down.

01:01 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Kitty from Tibo - 08-06-2363]

Kitty,
Im writing this letter as a last resort. If you truly love me, then I need you to act like it and at least give me the dignity of listening to my side of the story.
Cria and Fawkes have been hunting me ever since I joined the Calaway's organization. Fawkes took it personally that I left without telling him. Around the same time or soon thereafter, Anton fired on my expediter. Not my gunship, but my expediter. I almost lost my expediter several times coming into sector 15 because of all of the automated laser turrets that were frequently being put there. This is why I started flying around in a gunship as the gunship was able to withstand the laser fire and get me safely to Empanda. Maybe you disagree with the fact that I was flying around in a gunship, but that is why. I at least need you to understand.
If I am truly a coward, then why did people not call me that after I left with you and the Calaway's to go get their gunship? It was clearly my ship and we left out of sector 5. This happened after I was already being hunted by Cria and Fawkes. The next time I left to go out of locals was last month when I left out of sector 37. Remembering what you told me about the transverser not being a very good combat ship should we run into Praelor in deep space, I followed what you taught me by taking my gunship which I had upgraded for exploration. I left out of sector 37 intending to go to Celestia located Northwest and up from sector 37. I brought my tranny since I had no other ship that had medical facilities if Miriam and I had been injured in any way. I docked it in the gunship so that if we ran into Praelor on the way to Celestia, I could solo the gunship easier if need be. I also docked my fighter as a back up plan.
So no, I was not just transporting my tranny over to Miriam's place. I was trying to go to Celestia so that I could do some atmospheric salvaging there and had brought my tranny and fighter for the reasons above. The first time I attempted to leave, Cria and Fawkes showed up in their battle cruiser and heliogaster respectively. I asked for assistance and so did Miriam as she was with me. Ryan eventually showed up in his BC and by coordinating with us, we managed to jump out. 
I attempted it again a few days later and Cria chased me out of sector 37 again. This time, we saw him coming and jumped out before he got to us to another sector. The third time is when my gunship was blown up and I temporarily lost my tranny.
To those who call me a coward, it is important to choose your battles and to them I ask, "Who is the real coward?" Is it me with the least experience, or the ones with years experience fighting other pilots and purposefully out numbering the less experienced pilot? I would say it is the latter. It takes no courage whatsoever to fight an adversary that you know you have out gunned, and out numbered. That's truly a coward's act in my book. It takes more courage, maturity and more humility to talk with people instead of just throwing fists, so to speak.
So I don't care who calls me a coward. They should look at themselves first. You invited me out of locals soon after we broke up which would have probably coincided with the time I ended up leaving. Would I have been a coward then? I refuse to live my life in locals, because blood thirsty warmongers want me to. I joined the pilot corps to explore deep space, not to follow the whim, wants, desires, and irrational behavior of those who can't use words to negotiate and would rather just slug it out in a back alley. It's not my style and I refuse to bow down to that.
So, if you truly love me, and since you're obviously in contact with those people hunting me. You can pass on my message. Seems like you'd rather kiss their butts instead of give me the least bit of consideration or the benefit of the doubt.
If the roles were reversed, I would do what ever it took to defend you if I truly loved you. I would give anything to protect you and uphold your dignity and pride. I would give you the benefit of the doubt and listen to your side completely before making any judgements. You have done none of this. Cria and Fawkes and the people who call me cowards refuse to use this thing called words to negotiate with me. They tell you instead of telling me and what do you tell them? You agree wit
01:01 h them, right? You question what I did without even knowing all of the facts. You assume that I'm just this little doggy that Miriam has wrapped around her little finger. Well, think twice. If you really think that, then you obviously didn't know me very well.
After you found out that my gunship got blown up, you immediately began to reprimand me. You barely offered any sympathy or gave me a chance to explain myself. So you know what? I don't feel the love tonight. You can tell me all you want, but you need to show me. Not just tell me.

A tall hexagonal terminal dominates the center of this busy starship store. On each of its six faces, various models of starships move about through a starry backdrop of space. A sign above the terminal directs customers to tap the starship of their choice to make a purchase. Tucked into a corner at the front of the store, a middle age woman sits behind a tall counter with a stack of papers arranged neatly before her. Lining the walls and situated on tables throughout the store are working models of the various exploration class starships.

Additional Information:
  The one-person fighter is the premier combat vessel for the independent starship pilot. It comes equipped with four laser turrets, all of which are operated from the control room, and represents a formidable opponent to an undercrewed or weaker starship. The fighter is a small, sleek craft with very little wasted space. It contains little more than is absolutely necessary for its intended goal, which is combat. The fighter has very little storage capacity and no extraneous internal rooms.

Mass: 1.5
Cargo capacity: 2000
Charge: 4 hours
FTL range: 10.0 LY
Armor: No

Additional Information:
  The two-person asteroid hauler features the unique ability to anchor itself to an asteroid and slowly tow it back into known space for processing. This vessel is critical to humanity's production capabilities, though it lacks any real means of defending itself against attack and serves little purpose other than towing asteroids to collection stations.

Cannons: 0
Docking bay: No
Mass: 0.5
Cargo capacity: 250
Charge: 9 hours
FTL range: 0.0 LY
Armor: No
Upgrades: nothing

Additional Information:
  The one-person fighter is the premier combat vessel for the independent starship pilot. It comes equipped with four laser turrets, all of which are operated from the control room, and represents a formidable opponent to an undercrewed or weaker starship. The fighter is a small, sleek craft with very little wasted space. It contains little more than is absolutely necessary for its intended goal, which is combat. The fighter has very little storage capacity and no extraneous internal rooms.

Additional Information:
The two-person asteroid hauler features the unique ability to anchor itself to
an asteroid and slowly tow it back into known space for processing. This vessel
is critical to humanity's production capabilities, though it lacks any real
means of defending itself against attack and serves little purpose other than
towing asteroids to collection stations.

Cannons: 0
Docking bay: No
Mass: 0.5
Cargo capacity: 250

Additional Information:
The one-person fighter is the premier combat vessel for the independent
starship pilot. It comes equipped with four laser turrets, all of which are
operated from the control room, and represents a formidable opponent to an
undercrewed or weaker starship. The fighter is a small, sleek craft with very
little wasted space. It contains little more than is absolutely necessary for
its intended goal, which is combat. The fighter has very little storage capacity
and no extraneous internal rooms.

02:40 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, and a transparent architectural design simulator here.
You can go south and out.

03:06 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, and a transparent architectural design simulator here.
You can go south and out.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Eden" and the one-person cargo hauler "Debris Collector" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Incredulous Incredibility", and the three-person heliogaster "Trinity of Oblivion" landed here.

You can go north, east, southeast, southwest, west, and down.

03:15 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

03:15 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

03:16 You make a selection on a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

03:16 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kitty" reports current location pinpointed at Pinnacle.

03:17 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

03:17 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

03:17 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

03:17 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

03:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:17 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

03:17 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

03:17 Enter a destination:

03:17 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

03:17 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 7, 9."

03:17 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

03:17 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:17 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:17 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

03:17 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

03:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

03:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:17 As the ship descends toward the planet, the tops of the gleaming silver structures below can be seen.

03:17 Details of the structures begin to become more apparent as the ship comes closer to the planet.  The overall heart-shape of the structures can be noticed upon final approach.

03:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

03:17 You must stand up first.

03:17 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

03:17 You stand up.

--------------------------------------------------
The four-person surveyor is the beginning starship for any AIE explorer. The ship boasts an advanced sensory system which allows for the early detection and, consequently, avoidance of large obstacles that might catch any other starship by surprise in uncharted space. In addition, it comes standard with ten days of charge, a subwarp drive, a slip drive, and ample storage space. The only area this starship lacks is weaponry, as it was designed for exploration rather than combat.


The Transverser boasts the next step in propulsion technology; the wavewarp drive. Using the wavewarp technology, the starship "rides" through space using rapidly generated energy pulses which propel the ship forward. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your purposes), this energe pulse causes a shockwave which will damage any nearby starships or small objects. This technology is frowned upon for regular use, as it damages anything in its pa
03:23 th indiscriminately, but it can be a valuable tool for the explorer in a pinch. A patch is required for the wavewarp drive to function within the NAVI system.


The runabout class, a basic design shared by all alliances, has been boosted using alien technology that researchers discovered. After researching several alien hull plates and field emitters, AIE scientists were able to create a new EM field "skin" that will rest along a specially modified hull. The goal began as a way to shield the craft against excessive damage, but had the unexpected side effect of repelling proximity weapons and displacing them into alternate coordinates, potentially damaging any starships in the vicinity. Research on a shield has yielded no results of yet, but the AIE runabout is a formidable opponent against forces who rely on proximity weapons to damage vessels.

The Five-Person Transverser
Cost: 250,000,000.00
Point Requirement: 2300, 50
Turrets: 6
Cannons: 3
Docking bay: One
Mass: 6.0
Cargo capacity: 6500
Charge: 10 days
FTL range: 350.0 LY
Armor: No
Upgrades: Subwarp Drive, Galactic Map Unit, and Wavewarp Drive
Additional Information: The Transverser boasts the next step in propulsion technology
the wavewarp drive. Using the wavewarp technology, the starship "rides" through space using
rapidly generated energy pulses which propel the ship forward. Unfortunately (or
fortunately, depending on your purposes), this energe pulse causes a shockwave
which will damage any nearby starships or small objects. This technology is
frowned upon for regular use, as it damages anything in its path indiscriminately, but it can be a valuable tool for the explorer in a pinch. A patch is
required for the wavewarp drive to function within the NAVI system.

12:41 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:41 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:41 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:41 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

12:41 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:41 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:41 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:41 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:41 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

12:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

12:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:42 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:42 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

Large robotic arms are constantly in motion transporting starships to and from the overhead docking bay in this cavernous starship garage. The echo from the launching and landing of ships reverberates off the concrete walls, creating a cacophony of sound when combined with the mechanical whirl of the busy sanitation drones that dart among the powered down starships. Blue and white lines have been painted onto the stone floor, serving as markings to keep the ships in some semblance of organization. Every so often, one of the large metallic arms will pick up a starship and transfer it to another area of the garage to optimize the available space.

16:29 You peer west and see...
["Bhan" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. You see an oval silver picture frame engraved with tiny roses containing a picture of a rosy sunrise over a calm ocean hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a small dark brown leather sofa with a pattern of stars carved into the legs, a gleaming white marble end table with ornate scrollwork carved into the legs with a jade green frosted glass vase engraved with stars holding a bouquet of roses sitting on top of it, a small black marble fountain with a stream of water flowing from the points of a star, a comfy blue velvet captain's chair, a comfy blue velvet co-captain's chair, a comfortable silver leather beanbag cha

16:29 ["Bhan" Weapons Room 2] (indoors) (sitting on an elegant blue gunner's chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

You can go northwest, southwest, and west.

16:29 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:30 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:30 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

16:30 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:30 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

16:30 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:30 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:30 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:31 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:31 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

16:31 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:31 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, and a transparent architectural design simulator here.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

17:02 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

17:02 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

17:03 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

17:03 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

17:03 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

17:03 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

17:03 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

17:03 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

17:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

17:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:03 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

17:03 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Malacre; Docking Bay.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

20:16 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

20:16 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

20:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:16 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."
> (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has undocked from Empanda Station.

20:16 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

20:16 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:16 You don't see "emapnda" in a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen.

20:16 You don't have "empanda".

20:16 You remove a droid remote titled "rolukssica" from a black leather briefcase.

20:16 A droid remote is already inserted into the slot. You'll need to TAKE it out first.

20:16 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:17 A polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen

20:17 this polished rosewood entertainment center is designed to hold video and audio equipment and discs. In a large central square compartment, a sleek video screen has been bolted. surrounding the screen are compartments and shelves of various sizes. The bottom of the entertainment center contains small wooden doors which open to reveal sliding drawers of slots. The top of the shelving unit is flat.
The display is currently blank.
You see a droid remote titled "Empanda" inside.

20:17 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:17 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:17 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

20:17 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:17 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

20:17 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:17 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:17 You remove a droid remote titled "Empanda" from a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen.

20:17 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:17 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

20:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

20:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

20:17 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

20:17 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.
You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

20:17 You must stand up first.

20:17 You must stand up first.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

20:32 ["Phantom Flame" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The room is bathed in dull blue light emanating from the wormhole outside. You see a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

21:09 Tops Lists
--------------------------------------------------
Tops lists are listings of players who are at the top of their field in various aspects of the game. You can get a complete list of these commands, and what they rate, by typing: @TOPS-LIST

Most of these lists accept arguments that modify the output. The following arguments should work:
  me                        - Display your character's position in the list. Example: @tops me
  <number>                  - Displays <number> entries in the list. Example: @tops 50 to view 50 entries.
  <number>-<othernumber>    - Display a range between <number> and <othernumber>. Example: @tops 20-30 to display numbers 20 through 30.

If you wish to be excluded from these lists, you can use the @TOPS-EXCLUDE command.

Player-owned Space Stations, Moons, and Planets
--------------------------------------------------
PLANETS, MOONS, AND SPACESTATIONS:

Q: What do I need to get a planet, moon, or spacestation?
A: For spacestations, you need 10 billion credits and 10000 points. For moons, you need 20 billion credits and 15000 points. For planets, you need 30 billion credits and 25000 points. You also pay additional fees for each room you add.

Q: Where can I put my spacestation, planet, or moon?
A: In any sector, including places out of local space, except sector 24, sector 15, sector 12, sector 9, sector 13, sector 19, sector 0, sector 30, sector 115, sector 14 and sector 32. These sectors are subject to change and can be added to at any time.

Q: What can these fine places have?!
A: They can have an optional pool, an optional hot tub, and an optional private garage. You also may have a security center which allows you to control flight control and monitor rooms on the station, planet, or moon. You can also have a room that monitors the sector around your station, planet, or moon. Additionally, you're allowed to have five custom item stores for a station, seven custom item stores for a moon, and nine custom item stores for a planet. Any additional stores will have to be a tradesman item. Custom item stores are defined as stores with special clothing, food or other collectable items. You may have a transport pod as long as the station, planet, or moon is not out of local space. Player-owned space stations, planets, and moons cannot contain facilities that allow for point transfers to take place, including artifact research centers, passenger transport facilities, etc. Stations, planets and moons cannot be self-contained. This means you cannot design a station that eliminates your need to travel to other planets to obtain specific services or goods. Example: starship registries.

Q: Can my station be armed?!?!
A: Sorry, no.

Q: Can I keep people out of my station, planet, or moon?
A: You can control flight control which will deny docking to a whole alliance, everybody but owners and caretakers, or specific ships based on your choice. If landing is disabled to all, even the ITPN station becomes non-functional.

Q: ITPN Stations??! Oh my oh my! What do they entail?!
A: All private space stations, moons and planets are required to have an ITPN station on them. These stations cannot be past a security checkpoint, meaning that everybody has to be able to get to them. ITPN stations may have only a single destination. The destination is determined by the sector that your private space station, moon or planet is in. If there is already a planet, moon or station in the sector you are building in, your ITPN destination goes to that location. Otherwise, the ITPN pod will go to the sector hub. That's Pax for sectors 1 through 20, and the ITPN hub in secto
21:46 r 33 for sectors 21 through 40. An example would be if a person build a moon in sector 31. There is a planet there with an ITPN station already, so the one on the private moon would go to that planet, which would then go to the hub. Private space stations, moons and planets not in a numbered sector can not have an ITPN station.

23:21 ["Critical Strike" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room.
