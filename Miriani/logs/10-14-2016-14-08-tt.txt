Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark pink tee appliqued with small neon pink
dragonflies, a pair of blue low rise denim jeans, and a pair of baby blue
leather clogs with a row of multicolored daisies across the toes. She is also
wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender
bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a light
purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, and a soft fuchsia Tardick
lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists,
both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a small white trash bin,
Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a glossy purple ceramic felo
chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a small yellow
ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Meow the little calico
CatBot, a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and coral rocks,
Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a robotic chef named Nellie, a compact
white refrigerator, Samantha the old large violet felo, and a small Bari-shaped
tidbit here.

scoop, we'd get 4 like we had been, but we only get 3. It goes down tonight."

the requirements, and compare them to what points we have. We used to have the

platforms only contribute their base stats. Upgrading the tactical platform is
the way to go unless you intend to swap out ships and use them in their
unattached state."

[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes. First, write a profile. There are
some great help files for it."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Read help basic profile, and jump off
from there. There are a lot of profile help files available, read help profile
to see all of them."
[Newbie Help] Amelia Turner transmits, "Yes, but not just that, the story that
keeps my character lively and interesting to play."
Samantha the old large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The profile is the first step."
[Newbie Help] Michael Winters transmits, "You just do that through everyday play
and interaction."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, there is also the goals command, as
well as policy 14 (please make sure to read all of the policies regardless)."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "From there, there are a lot of things to
develop your character."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Otherwise, just basically, interact with
people! Roleplay! Keep yourself alive."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "First, just how you interact others,
what you choose to do, to like, to tell folks about yourself."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "And yes, policy 14 is a wonderful
policy!"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "All of the policies are wonderful
policies which should be read by all players!"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hear, hear!"
[Newbie Help] Amelia Turner transmits, "Is there a lot to do in the game other
than piloting? I know piloting's the theme, but I want a character with
interesting layers to her."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There are many parts to piloting."
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "Help activities might be able to answer
that...but what do you mean by that?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I mean, technically, you could even
play a non-piloting character if you really wanted to."
[Newbie Help] Amelia Turner transmits, "I could? How would that work?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew laughs.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well...you sit in the lounge all day,
pretty much."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There are some people who have played
non-piloting characters in the past. Those characters are pretty much just
roleplay-intensive. They can be anything from chefs to probably communications
officers if you can play that part well enough and submit a good profile for
it."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Has that successfully been done?"
[Newbie Help] Amelia Turner transmits, "I mean in the way of hobbies. Sports,
music, fashion, things a character can get involved in."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, those kinds of characters are
special-application. You'd hvae to send a support ticket and talk to a host
about it, probably."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "There's room for pilots to have other
interests. Some are artists of one sort or another, for instance, and make
little glass blown sculptures or paintings or what-have-you when they aren't
doing piloting type work."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There are musical instruments available.
There is also the option of donation items which can really enhance your rp. We
don't have a lot of sports, per se, but there is competitive tea drinking
and...dodgeball??"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one who has played one of the roleplay
and no work characters has stuck around, sadly. However, it is still a possible
avenue to pursue. I myself have actually considered several of these types of
characters in the past."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I suppose one could also technically
make their char semi-retire into one of these things...get all the work done and
become something else but still stay in the game."
[Notification from Starseekers] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid
Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Seeking
Highlights". The organization has earned 582,294.10 credits and 1 megacredit.
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm sure that's a possibility. Like I
said, if you're interested in that kind of thing, just send a support ticket,
and the hosts will take it from there, I'm sure. As for the original question,
generally, a pilot can have any hobbies that any normal person can have.
Obviously, you can't play a cold-blooded psychopath or the like, as pilots are
psychologically screened to ensure that they have no mental disorders which
might keep them from operating a valuable piece of equipment within safe limits
to themselves and others."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "The lasers on even the smallest ship are
still the size of a small car."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you turn on silent running, you'll
still get notification from the arti detector, correct?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes."
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "Yep."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yes, it'll stop your ship."
[Notification from Starseekers] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid
Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Seeking
Highlights". The organization has earned 573,118.53 credits.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, that's what I thought. I've never
had it on when I found one before, so didn't know how it would notify me that it
had stopped automatically."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Does anyone know if the solar panels
continue to suffer damage even after a ship is fully charged?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alright, I guess I shall test it! Thanks
for the silence."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Your ship is always draining charge, so
they take damage as they keep trying to charge it up."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Is the amount of damage based on what
systems are active or is it set?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "I believe, but am not certain, that it is
based on how much of the ship's total charge is restored."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Figures. I wish there was an optional way
to deactivate them."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "A big blanket for your ship?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew chuckles. "That's an interesting picture..."

Want to know if anyone's relaxing in a public venue? Check WHERE!
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, the way I figured them is that they
were coating the hull of the vessel. So, I invisioned a method of deactivation
which would have them shift I.E, turn over, so that the solar panels wouldn't be
directly exposed to any star light they come into contact with. We shall make it
work regardless though!"
[Newbie Help] Amelia Turner transmits, "What activities can a brand new
character with no points do?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Salvaging, mail deliveries, asteroid
mining, couriering, scooping fater you've gotten a few credits..."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Read help starting out."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "This is when I wish my char's book was
finished."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If you bought the pilot's guide to
preparation, you will see a bunch of activities on one of the pages (I forget
which page) which has a detailed list of activities that you can start doing
right away without spending any credits other than those you spent on buying
your first ship."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Working with other people is good too. You
don't need a specialized ship of your own if you're crewing on someone else's.
Gunning on warships or partnering with someone on their asteroid hauler come to
mind."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met our
first tier performance goal! Let's keep pushing for the second!"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "The latter requires a modest outlay for
the spacesuit and hauling tool you'll need to secure the asteroid, but the
former just requires you know how to use the guns and follow directions."
[Newbie Help] Amelia Turner transmits, "Where can I get started with asteroid
mining?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Preferably an asteroid hauling station
controled by your alliance."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The lower the security rating of the
sector, the better."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's a help file on it, there's also
a book."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But yes, there are help files for
everything!"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And books for most things."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "In fact, help activities is a very good
one."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "The most popular one for League characters
is the Belt of Crias. It provides the biggest mining sites."
[Newbie Help] Amelia Turner transmits, "It doesn't seem to give a limit on which
activities require points."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You might also try to locate someone and
just ask some questions. We are very helpful folk."
[Newbie Help] Damien Goss transmits, "I am in no way saying don't ask questions
here cause this is what the channel is for. Most things can be asked in
character as well and most things are explainable in character."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Most activities don't require specific
points, per se, just the equipment to do them. There are some...like belt
management, though."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "A lot of activities don't require
starting out points. However, you can buy upgrades and/or other items which can
increase reward payouts."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Out of my head, Ather."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "A lot of equipment upgrades make the task
more convenient to do, too. But they're not necessary, just nice to have when
you can get them."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There are also directed things...like
talking to the cadet orientation officer will get you started with some of
them."
[Newbie Help] Volmar Nacht transmits, "That's what I'm doing right now."

people on the trip she ran to the aquarium so she would not need to share the
eggs she wanted. And last week after we left some eggs and made the effort to
try and get the aquarium back to a better state, 1 week after we luted the place
clean, she asked pierre, well, I don't suppose we will be able to collect more
eggs yet. I got into an argument with her over that too, I told her how does she
expect to help the aquarium if ever time we visit we pick the place clean."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "So maybe not selfish in all areas.
But yeah. I know you are her boyfriend, but I am really worried."

clearly stated I was supposed to keep it quiet because she did not want to bring
too many people because of the eggs."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "But regardless, yeah, if I decided
to let people know that I planned to leave on a trip 24 hours from now, I'd

vasselization request through better, now I don't have to live in such a small
space with Lily for a few weeks. But she has tried to make me feel stupid a few
too many times. And how she yelled at you last week about using the cryotubes
next time you planned to sleep longer than usual, was very uncalled for. Same as
yelling at Klaus for not writing on the message board, when no one had for 3
days. It was not her ship, not her place to tell people what to do in such a
way."

the crew out there." Kim Saunders smiles at you. "Anfisa is not easy to please.
Easy to offend though. And I knew people like Nissi and Akemi and even Anfisa
somewhat, they don't easily get freaked out by rift things. New pilots like

Hi Shule,
First of all let me just say I enjoyed getting to know both you and Lily on this
most recent expedition we all took. I had considered you a friend for a while,
but Lily I didn't know all that well, and it was great to hang out with you
both.
I'm writing to you this morning to request a favor whnich I am prepared to pay
you for if you're willing to do it. I am looking for someone to craft an
artifact detector for me for my asteroid hauler. I am now capable of rift travel
after this last trip and I am looking to spend time at both the bubble and at
the out of comms roid hauling spot at 288. I cannot yet craft an artifact
detector and was wondering if you would be willing to do it for me and how much
you would require for such an item. Please let me know at your convenience and
I'll be happy to work something out with you.
Gratefully,
Corey

[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "And when did this happen?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "A while back. I thought I told you. I'm
sorry if I didn't. It's been maybe a month now. Damien Goss tried to find it for
me, because it was dead and I escaed to give him a signal, but he couldn't find
it."

that... July?"

boosters, and I was so panicked I didn't think to self-destruct it."

charge. Did you fall asleep in space?"

by myself, and I think I just got bored and..."

[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Just, great. Another ship floating about
somewhere for any lucky individual who might stumble upon it."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Yes. I know. When it happened, I felt
stupid, thank you for driving the point home for me."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, I'm sorry. The AEU pilot core is in
enough trouble as it is without that. And if it happened so long ago, I really
wonder why I only heard about it now. I trust the members of my org, especially
my trustees. So why did you not trust me to come talk to me about it?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Yeah, I did that on purpose. I really
thought I'd told you, Kim. I'm sorry I fail as a trustee, I'm sorry I fail as a
person and do dumb things all the time. I'm sorry and I won't blame you if you
want me to step down as trustee or leave the org."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, if you have time, we should meet in
person to discuss that."
