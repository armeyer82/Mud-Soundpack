02:31:01 You say, "Sure."

02:31:02 You grin.

02:31:03 Lily Kaise stands up from a large leather couch.

02:31:06 Lily Kaise glides north.

02:31:09 You stand up from a large leather couch.

02:31:09 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]

02:31:10 The two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican", the scout "White Eagle", and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

02:31:10 Some lights on the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" flash as Lily Kaise boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

02:31:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:31:11 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:31:11 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:31:12 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:31:12 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

02:31:13 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:31:16 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:31:18 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:31:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:31:26 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:31:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:31:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:31:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:31:41 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:31:42 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:31:42 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

02:31:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:31:46 Frontier Cluster (AEU) [Human Interalliance Space] (Security: Beta-5)

02:31:46 Coordinate rundown:
Starships: William Dove (M) at (18, 2, 9)
Space Stations: (19, 2, 8)


02:31:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:31:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:31:48 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:31:49 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:31:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:31:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:31:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:31:53 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:31:56 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

02:31:59 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:32:00 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:32:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:32:06 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:32:11 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:32:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:32:13 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:32:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:32:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:32:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:32:28 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at Pengyou Homelife; Mail Room.

02:32:30 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:32:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:32:30 You say, "Going to check mail an my office and such."

02:32:33 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

02:32:33 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:32:38 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:32:56 The postal machine informs you that you have mail waiting.  After some movements coming from the back room, the conveyor belt coming from the wall swiftly brings forth a mail bin. You grab it off the belt, eager to see its contents.

02:33:06 a mail bin with "Shule Elemmire" printed on the side

02:33:06 You see nothing special.
It is open.
Inside it you see a fine piece of paper with an official header reading "From the founder of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars" and a fine piece of paper with an official header reading "From the founder of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars".

Hello Constantine,
Hope all is going well with you and that you've had a nice break
from work ... or well I don't really consider piloting to be hard
work except when face to face with a big Rapid Assault!
I just wanted to let you know that we're still very eager to have
you join SEAS. I also want to emphasize that we are a full
facility organization with a well-equipped fleet of starships to
rent as well as we have two cruisers which are supported.
There is no requirement of you to contribute earned Points or
Credits. All contributions are voluntary as our primary goal is to
help you to develop to your fullest potential. At some point when
you feel that you would like to contribute towards organizational
goals, you would be welcomed to but never required unless there was
some unforeseen circumstance which depleted our resources. So far
though, SEAS has nearly 30 billion of available credits plus ample
balances in support and insurance funds. Shule and I have put a
lot of effort towards building up SEAS so that we could help
motivated newer pilots such as yourself. The only exception would
be that when you become Cruiser qualified and SEAS takes on the
responsibility to support your Cruiser, then we would appreciate
credits contributed towards its support. We still want to assure
that the Corps has enough Cruisers to aid in the defense of
humanity so provided you are an active member, if your income lev
02:33:17 el
is still insufficient to contribute, unless SEAS budget could not
sustain your Cruiser, then we would waive the credits contribution
requirement.
Last, we are selective in who we will choose to recruit as members.
Although we enjoy socializing, we are focused and serious about
our work. We want our members to represent strong ethical values
as well. Shule and I have been observing your progress and we
believe that you represent these core values.
We will look forward to the opportunity to add you as a member of
SEAS.
Kind regards
Lily Kaise

02:34:38 Hello Ryo,
Over the past few weeks, Shule and I, who are the founders of Space
Explorers Amidst the Stars (SEAS), have observed your progress as a
new pilot. We want to express to you that we are pleased with what
we've observed and proud that you have chosen to become a pilot
amongst our fine Corps.
If you are interested in joining an organization, at some point
when it is convenient, we would appreciate the opportunity to meet
with you to discuss SEAS with you and how the organization may
enhance your growth and development as a pilot.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Kind regards,
Lily Kaise

02:36:14 a brushed steel desk

02:36:14 Constructed of steel with a fine brushed surface, this desk is modestly sized but stylish and sleek.

02:36:52 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:36:52 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:36:53 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:36:53 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

02:36:58 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:37:01 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:37:02 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:37:05 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:37:11 Lily Kaise says, "Ok forgot glittering."

02:37:14 Lily Kaise grins.

02:37:14 You grin.

02:37:15 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:37:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:37:17 You say, "Oh, Yeah."

02:37:18 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:37:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:37:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:37:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:37:34 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:37:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to The Glittering Belt. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:37:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:37:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:37:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:37:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:37:42 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:37:42 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

02:37:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:37:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:37:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:37:48 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:37:49 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Glittering Belt."

02:37:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:37:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:37:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:37:53 This asteroid belt is unusually close to its star, and the slowly rotating asteroids glitter brightly in the sunlight.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Space Station Delta in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:37:56 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:37:56 Via general sector communication, Space Station Delta transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

02:37:59 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid Belt Management Station.

02:38:02 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:38:23 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm debating about turning the belt management I have but perhaps it will help us get that one goal at least."

02:38:41 You say, "Yeah, I was thinking about my belt management points."

02:38:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:38:43 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

02:38:45 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:38:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

02:38:48 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:38:49 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:38:49 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:38:50 Lily Kaise glides in.

02:38:57 You may not leave the starship while it is moving.

02:38:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:38:58 You exit the ship.

02:38:58 [Asteroid Belt Management Station]
The four-person mule "Liberator", the scout "Pathseeker", the two-person Accord gemini "Amaterasu", the two-person light transport "Dreamstar", and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are parked here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go nowhere.

02:38:58 Lily Kaise exits from the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove".

You can go south and out.

02:39:56 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:39:57 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:40:00 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:40:00 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:40:02 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

02:40:04 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:40:05 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:40:05 You grin.

02:40:06 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:40:07 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:40:10 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

02:40:15 A launch trajectory is located.

02:40:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:40:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:40:30 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:40:30 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:40:31 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:40:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:40:43 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:40:46 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

02:40:59 Lily Kaise says, "Ohdarn I forgot to toggle my points back on."

02:41:02 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:41:04 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:41:05 You laugh. "Oops."

02:41:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:41:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:41:11 I see no "shasta" here.

02:41:26 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 105" has jumped into the sector.

02:41:29 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 105! Welcome to home space!"

02:41:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:41:31 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:41:32 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a standard signal: "Greetings."

02:41:32 Via general sector communication, Registered Merchant 105 directs a standard signal at this ship: "Greetings."

02:41:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:41:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:41:43 Lily Kaise says, "Too bad as that would have been another 60 for the org."

02:41:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:41:47 You nod.

02:41:49 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:41:49 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:41:52 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:42:47 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Not A Target Drone!". The organization has earned 749,281.98 credits.

02:50:04 You grin.
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

03:07:28 Lily Kaise dangles a day old slice of three-meat pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

03:09:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:13:37 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "The BAS is mostly full."

03:13:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, I just filled it a bit ago."

03:13:54 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

03:13:55 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I just put in two pieces of starship debris."

03:13:58 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I have one little piece of debris for it."

03:13:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

03:14:02 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:14:02 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:39:30 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Also rift drives are good for you if you have the points, at least put it on one ship."

03:39:32 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Awesome Mel then nobody should ever get lost nor be concerned about a long flight fia autotravel."

03:40:01 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Why are you being snippy with me? I did nothing to you. Johann and I were having a civil conversation."

03:40:02 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Rift drives are awesome if you have the points for one. Not everyone does, however."

03:40:21 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That is the purpose of Rift Inserters."

03:40:23 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I know I am just saying if you do have the points."

03:40:59 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Are you suggesting that I don't help new pilots learn because we don't support 777?"

14:59:28 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hi all, 2 things. I have learned from the Liaison office that Mr. Lambeth will plan to attend our meeting tomorrow evening, July 1st at 23:30, to be held in the conference room on New Earth. Secondly, this is maybe not really my job, although safety of our ships and the spaceport concerns us all. It concerns the one-person cargo hauler The GimbleGhost, which has been sitting on the landing pad all powered up for several days. To whomever owns it, will you please power it down and check that there are no bari aboard your ship. Should you need assistance in dealing with bari, I am sure someone will be glad to help. This is also a call out to all our new pilots who may not be aware, after you land somewhere, please power down your ship. I suppose the only exceptions are if you are immediately going to launch again, or if you have ordered a repair, but when you are not using a ship, it should be powered down and preferably safe in the garage. Considering the risk a powered up ship poses not only to itself, but to all other ships on the landing pad, I will now have no choice but to inform the liaison office, they might need to send someone to take care of the matter. Thank you for your attention and see you all tomorrow evening if not before. [08:49 30 June 2317 GST]

15:00:00 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

15:00:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

19:40:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
19:40:07 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

23:50:00 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
