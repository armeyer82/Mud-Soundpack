Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;
Docking Bay.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small yellow ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small seashell pink trash can, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in a garage.

drive, and a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers" here.

If it's a matter of delegating someone else to maintain another area, I am fully
equipped to assist. I just don't want the responsibility for all of the stations
in all of the areas which I've had before and that was when we had fewer areas
to maintain. I sense though it's more more to do with the costs involved. I
would also personally contribute though out of my own funds to keep everyone
happy. Just let me know what I can do.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in a garage.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sleeveless buttercup yellow cotton top with a v-neck and a row
of tiny embroidered flowers at the edges, a pair of white low rise denim jeans,
and a pair of shiny buttercup yellow patent leather clogs. She is also wearing
an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet
of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone
in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both
elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying a big red soldier felo kitten in her right hand, and a hefty
light red soldier felo in her left hand.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the

Long-term rentals:
The fighter and heavy bomber listed in this section are generally similar to the
ones rented at Tannhauser, save for the fact that I'm pretty sure they start out
with stock upgrades and have to be upgraded by the long-term renter. The modular
tactical platform and the Modular Terrorerotici both can only have
corporation-based fighters such as the hyperion ships or the ones rented either
short-term or long-term by Agnar attached to them as far as we've deduced, as
well as the shuttles manufactured by corporations such as Hermes or United. You
can attach the ships to the platforms only from space. Note: the docking bay
size of the tactical platform and the Terrorerotici will increase depending on
the types of ships you have attached to them.

If you want to own a six-person ship to do stuff in and don't quite qualify for
the Pincer, then this ship is for you! It has fewer weapons, but would be able
to perform well enough in a fight with decent upgrades. It does however require
you to fill out an application, and approval or denial notifications may take
some time to reach you, but you'll be notified by mail regardless.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I don't usually but it is actually
more efficient and I should."

Morris, just do 285 and 134. I know Orion will be lower as the grade is lower.
Ather, I agree with you, I don't want to see Orion dropped.
Lily, my thing is not man power to build. I just simply think it's not necessary
to maintain three salvage stations. For one thing, Orion and 285 are very close
together and Orion stays. Then 134 is over 13 light-years out, if folks get the
option of higher grade for just a few light-years out, they will most likely go
there and 134 begins to be put up for very little earnings.
We've got one local station, another that's 4.something light-years out and the
other is over 13.

Well most people aren't willing to pay a toll to shuttle back and forth to Orion
for 285 or 134 but i agree with you, I'd support a Salvaging station in 285
moreso as it is much higher in grade. I haven't seen that much activity from the
Salvaging station in 134 but ironically, it's the one from which my organization
has earned the 3 command points it has. So I'd say that for newly founded
organizations, being able to participate on Salvage processing stations is very
helpful. We definitely need to maintain Orion for all of the aforementioned
points. Just let me know if there's anything i can assist with.

where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent
atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. A few of the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Three.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small lavender trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick gold fringe, a large white and dusky pink paisley floor pillow

You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
M0<X9fcq2'E/WG[au1;7X+Ka"l1;yL2I6@|k#YZI
Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'RockIt!.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Metal-rich Asteroid Surface.

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the

overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay
Four.

[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "So, in your board post you mentioned
expelling iron and something else...lead maybe. I think I'd heard that before.
That makes for more valuable loads?...ok, so it's two questions..."
A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, the more pieces of debris, the more
points."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "That is what I waalways discovered
anyway, and what people told me."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, I did not know that. So then here is
the second quesiton. When something breaks apart, does it become as low-value as
the free floating debris, or is it as valuable as the pieces you pulled?"
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "I thought that the larger pieces that
came off might be more valuable."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Depending on what they were, of course."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "The answer to your second question is, as
valuable as what came off the original chunk. Of course."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Man, I hate leaving asteroids
sitting somewhere."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, I thought perhaps I was doing
something wrong by going ahead and salvaging those pieces. Thanks."

285, so can't reply right away."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "That's all right."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "The one thing I notice is that debris
chunks aren't as prevalent as Orion or 134, so you clear out a sector pretty
quickly."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "That is true."
[General Communication] Corey Matthews transmits, "I must be sleepier than I
thought. I'm doing tesla, I finished a mission, launched, was at the gate,
thought I was at the gate to start a new m ission, launched and went back into
the mission and found that all tunnels had been mined and had to launch again so
I could go get paid."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sounds like it's time to go to
bed."
[General Communication] Corey Matthews transmits, "Soon. Very soon. I'm fighting
it. I never said I was the smartest pilot."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. If I expelled the lead and iron I'd
have over 63,000 units to expel."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "It's simple. With lead and iron you get
your loads in faster. Each load will pay less but you can do more in the same
time. Expelling lead and iron will make your salvaging go real slow. More
points, not necesarily more credits though, but it might take you an hour or
more."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "So...in the end, with the time spent,
you perhaps could have gotten another load in the same time and had the same
value for time spent? Or is it more complicated than that?"
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have never experimented quite that
far."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, I can't change my tactic right now
while doing these tests...If I did that it would make them invalid."
[Starseekers] Kim Saunders transmits, "If I feel like just doing multiple loads,
I bring everything I find. If I am patient, or like you in a place where there
is no salvage station, I throw out the big stuff. There is no wrong or right
though, it is all preference."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wonder how that applies to shipwecks
though. I would think the tiny pieces like spacesuit gloves would be nearly
worthless, yet they do pull off of chunks. It's something to fool around with at
some point. But since I did the test the way I always have out at Orion, I don't
want to skew the results. I'll just take the hit if I have to on this, which I'd
figured anyway."

fond of either but that's just me. I find comets to be balanced, but grade 30
leaves much to be desired."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

We did without 134 for quite awhile. It's nice to have, but if we're going to
shuffle stations around I say let it go this time and put up a marker beacon in
the Battle of Mir, so that local artifact hunters are less likely to get lost. A
marker beacon on a large battery will last an outrageous amount of time, over a
month at least, and can be autotraveled to by ships without rift drives so long
as they're within 10 sectors of it.

Well, I did Orion already and have numbers for that. The grade there is the same
as 134, though different material. I needed sleep, imagine that, but am taking
the transport out to 285 here in a few minutes after I grab some food. Unless
there tends to be more 20 and Orion and more 30 at 134, I know they're both 20
and 30. I'm looking forward to the 40-60 at 285, even if it does end up costing
me to haul it. Should be fun...kind of. I'll do 134 last, since it's
further...and that way I can stay out tthere for a few loads. I'll get to try
out shooting roids eventually.

Hi all,
We have some good discussion going on here.
I will try to comment on a few things i have read, others I will leave until I
have been able to do a bit more comparison.
1. Yes, the salvage processor and xenology in Belt of Orion should stay there,
for the reasons several people have already given.
2. salvaging in 134 can give very few or very many industry points, depending on
how patient you are. But then again, if you did 5 loads with more larger pieces
of debris, you might maybe get similar results and spend the same time some
people spend collecting only the tiny pieces of debris and leaving the hunks of
metal, control boards and sensor components. I am personally way past the point
where 134 is of use to me, but I know that for new pilots earning those first
1000 industry points is the hardest, after that mighty grapple II and medium
transport, life does get easier.
3. 285 does offer pretty reasonable salvaging if you expel the lead and iron.
But I have found that 136 does offer grade 40 and sometimes 50 comets, and they
are nice to salvage too. I have not had the time to compare both places
thoroughly, but wil do so over the next few days.
4. As for asteroids, I really like the result at 285 a lot more. They pay on
average the same, but finding more closer together does allow you to get more
work done in a shorter space of time. The result is more money and more points,
for pilots and orgs. And the travel distance between one and the other is not
really that massive.
5. I think autotravel with autovector works at least 20 or 25 sectors out from a
beacon, or so it did when I last was that far out. That's neither here nor there
though. Both battle of mir and 134 give you lots of artifacts on some days, and
very few on others. I have done only a bit of comparing, but for local artifacts
battle of mir is an option.
6. I think it is very hard to tell where your command points come from. I
believe that they, like other points, are not given out as whole points but as
tenth of a point, so you may not get to see them until you have earned a full
point.
This is it for me for this moment. Keep your experiences coming, so that we can
come up with a decision that we can all live with.
Kim

The results are in. 
I used a medium transport with League Freighter-Class Storage Extender and a
double storage plant, giving it a total storage capacity of 120770, which is
201%  of standard storage. I also used a storage compressor. Grapple used was a
Mighty II. I did not expell anything from these loads prior to transferring. A
couple things; The debris out at Orion, as we know, is grade 20-30 in the form
of smallish asteroids, comets, etc. and generally about 2-5 meters in length.
The debris out at 285 is grade 40-60 in the form of slightly larger asteroids
and comets than Orion, and tend to be around 4 meters in length. 134 is
primarily small to medium shipwrecks with a grade of 20-30. The load I did out
there was a little odd in that it only contained small shipwrecks. You'll notice
there is a difference in the amount of pieces dropped at 134 compared to the
other two places. This may well have to do something with the point payout, but
like I said, I never expelled anything. Below are the results. Underneath that,
a few more thoughts and conclusions.

Conclusion: Even though the grade at 285 is significantly higher than at Orion,
the payout in points is only slightly higher, and the cash payout both for
myself and for the org is actually higher at Orion. 134 has a much more
significant point payout and a slightly higher cash payout both for the org and
for myself. For any necessary comparison, because I have heard some of the
payout on some things is based on your level of industry points, so I will say
that I am currently close to 1300.
Thanks to Michael Winters for taking me out to get a roid so that I could pay
the toll out to 285! Hopefully this is helpful information in determining which
of these stations is useful for what.

Here are a few more observations --
Shule and I hauled 20 asteroids earlier this morning from Alpha 285. I earned
463 million credits with an average payout of 23.15 million credits per
asteroid. Total Industry points earned by me were 40. Shule earned a total of
449 million credits with an average of 22.45 million credits per asteroid. We
earn on average more as our respective Industry is higher than 5000 Industry.
When I salvaged 3 loads of Grade 30 shipwrecks from 134, I only eliminated steel
but kept control boards and sensor components. The hold of my medium transport
is 105,720 with a storage plant. Each load was within plus or minus 1,000 units
of storage. Total points for all three loads were 76 and of course when divided
by 3 for the average yields 25.33 (rounded down). This is a very good points
average for grade 30 debris.
If 136 is located similarly to where there has been established a similar
arrangement without an Asteroid processor in prior months, when I have salvaged
in the area where 136 is, grade 50 comets were sparse and consisted primarily of
small comets with medium grade 50 comets being rare. No grade 60 asteroids were
present whereas grade 60 asteroids are more consistent than grade 50 comets.
Ideally, if we could have a debris field which yielded higher grade shipwrecks
or more frequent grade 50 comets in communications range, this would be optimal.
However to set up another operation for salvaging really isn't practical so I
would accept that the grade 40 to 60 asteroids in Alpha 285 would continue to be
a good compromise for higher grade debris along with decent asteroids to haul.
Battle of Mir artifacts are not as common as with 134 but I know that pilots who
have more experience than I remember that prior to the ability to build
temporary space stations, that one had to rift to an area such as 134 without
any of the current recharging or other supports and especially a relatively
short trek back to known beacons. I still would support 134 as an a better
alternative to Battle of Mir. I rarely hunt for Local artivacts anymore but just
as the Bubble is more accessible for those who are qualified for a Rift Drive, I
consider that an area such as 134 is just as viable for those who are working
towards their first Rift Drives.

I thought about it a little more, and having a closer option may outweigh the
benefit of having slightly better returns at 134. We've had chronic problems
with people going out to 134 and dozing off when the trip turns out to take more
than a few minutes owing to the distance from B-24 to 134 and the natural
variation in local rift conditions. I know several ships have been lost to
pirates looking to take advantage of inattentive pilots.

Well, considering I didn't expell anything, and I noticed that there would have
been a lot to expel out at 285, it might be that the payout there if you're
expelling is much more worth it. I'll wait on the next round of tests Melinda is
setting up. The only thing is, expelling means it does take considerably longer,
and I don't know that the gain in points (and I don't know if there is one with
cash payouts or not) equates to the extra time spent. This next round of tests
will be valuable to determine some of that. If it turns out that expelling makes
it equivalent to 134, then I would support putting both a salvage station and a
roid station in the same place that's closer. The lack of artifacts might be an
issue for some, it's not something I've focused on, so can't comment on that
other than that people have mentioned they are more sparse at Mir than at 134. I
did notice something at 285, and that's that you have to cover more sectors in
general to get a full load, based not only on the size of the debris chunks
compared to 134, but also that they are less prevalent; maybe two per sector as
oppoosed to four to six. I don't know how much that makes a difference for
different types of salvagers...those with more advanced equipment, including
faster engine speed, autovector, etc versus those without those things. The one
concern I have is that people who cannot get a Mighty II that can handle the
40-60 at 285 wouldn't want to or wouldn't know that they can use a different
grapple with a higher grade capability but lower strength.

There is lower grade debris near Orion. No rift travel, maybe less points but
it's easy access.
Also, I am far too lazy to expel debris.

I'm just going to state my few thoughts. and what I'd like to see.
gaining, 30 points, for 188 pieces of debris, may look nice, but look at how
many pieces. from 134. take the same 188 pieces, and make that with grade 40 to
60 roids, expelling led and iron, it may take you several loads, but you could
in theory get, 50 or 60 points.
I personally find grappling shipwrecks to be long and tedious. when you expel
the larger stuff, I have salvaged for an hour straight, and got 200 pieces. and
only filled up 20k of my 120k medium transport. so to fill that up would take an
exceedingly long time. and for how much gain, yes those 200 pieces gave me
roughly 30 points, but is it worth it in the long run?
personally I'd like to see orion stay for the reasons listed. 134 and battle of
mir be used as artifacting spots, not, salvaging spots. 286, be used for roid
hauling, and we find, a cloud that has grade 30 to 50 or there abouts debris. be
it roids and comets. that seems to be pretty more balanced in my opinion. since
when salvaging roids, you're still expelling stuff so what's the most efficient
way to salvage. for me I prefer comets. small or medium matters not, they're
just the most balanced salvage as far as points verses credits verses time.
but these are just my thoughts.
so you wouldn't have to keep anything up in 134 but a beacon to travel between
there and 135,
286, keeps the roid station and beacon station,
orion keeps the salvage xeno, and what ever else.
if a balanced debris cloud was found, then, I could see a salvage station there,
and maybe an op station as well. but again these are my thoughts and what I'd be
more likely to use

So you're basically recommending 4 locations instead of 3? I thought we were
looking at possibly eliminating locations, not adding them, but I could be
wrong. Because I just don't know, how much harder is it to put up two stations
in a location rather than 1?  Also, how would a combination like this effect
costs?

no I'm suggesting 2 locations. not 4. drop the station for salvage in 134 and at
the roid field, and find a debris field like grade 30 to 50... with comets as
well as roids. like an ort cloud or something.

Ok, didn't realize you meant getting rid of the roid station. But even a marker
beacon is a location, even if it lasts longer, right? I agree a marker there and
nothing else would be less work, but that's three geographic locations...the
marker at 134, Orion, and new location, wherever that is. Which reminds me, what
is the debris grade in that oort cloud where 136 is?

mel there's no new location. morris I am suggesting, use 134 for artifacts so
all you need is the inserter and the beacon. keep 285 for roids so all you need
is beacon, inserter and roid station. orion for most salvage related things.
I am suggesting we find a new place to salvage, that's got a mix of comets and
roids, something like grade 30 to 50. since that's better balanced.
if that's done, you only need to keep up 2 salvage stations, instead of the
current 3.
but that's my 2 credits worth of an opinion.
personally I'm not fond of the salvage in 134, or, 285. though I did use 134 for
artifacts. when I wasn't having luck in battle of mir.

Then there would be 4 areas to maintain Sakura which is more the issue as well
as maintaining more than 2 Salvage processors. This is why we're considering
putting a Salvage processor in 285 as there is higher grade debris there.

Wait, since when do we have 3 salvage stations? Unless I'm missing something, we
have 2, Orion and 134. We have 2 roid stations, 136 and 285.

so the issue isn't maintaining 3 processers, it's just maintaining, too many
areas? then drop 134 and let all the new pilots deal with battle of mir.
I was under the impression that it was more, dealing with 3 salvage places.
285 may be good, but there's only 2 chunks per sector, and only asteroids. I was
taught that comets are the best points and credit wise. maybe not the most
expensive, but they are well balanced. that's why I was asking about a different
salvage spot.
but at least where salvaging's concerned. it's time invested, verses reward. and
making afficient use of one's time. make a prophet, while not spending 8 hours
trying to make it. take 134 if you salvage there, expell all the big stuff, it
will take a very long time to fill up, 108k. I got 200 pieces in a few hours.
and had only filled up a fifth of that. so to fill that all up. will be 10 hours
roughly. yes the points would be something like 90, but the time invested is
just a bit crazy.
grappeling strictly roids you could probably make that 90 points in a few loads,
still expelling led and iron. but it would take long to travel from point a to
point b.
if we had a place with 30 to 50 comets. as well as roids you have a good balance
there. with maybe 4 or 5 chunks per sector. like orion is now, but just a bit
further out to get better grade.

No no Sakura! other input is great here. We all love comets for salvaging. It's
just not practical at this time to support another debris field. We all so miss
the grade 80 debris field with those awesome large comets! However, they will
never be a reality in Communications Range.

Sakura, considering the times you've quoted, it's making me wonder if expelling
is even worth it. It seriously increases your amount of time spent. I could make
90 points in about 3 hours without expelling, why would I spend 10 hours
expelling the big pieces for the same reward? If I do 4 loads with a compressor
in 134, it takes about 3 hours if I work straight through and I average about
80-90 points. That makes a lot more sense to me than expelling stuff to get a
single load that gets me 90 points. I will have to try the expelling method
though to see what I think of it other than what you're describing here. I
actually just found out about it this morning, so have never done it that way.

Ok, so I came out here to 136 with a Fringeling cadet to introduce him to roid
hauling and also to do a little checking things out. The debris out here is
grade 30-50 asteroids and comets...basically the kind of place Sakura was
talking about. Yeah, the roids are less plentiful...way less plentiful. But they
are here. So, if we did want to do a combined spot, this might be a better
option than 285, depending on whether we wanted to focus more on the salvage or
on the roids. Not a recommendation or anything, it's just that Sakura got me
thinking about it.

chronometer, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a solid silver ring
engraved with dolphins, a backpack, and a bulky asteroid supply cannon. You are
concealing a flight control scanner, a leather briefcase, a camera bag, a thick

star on the side, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a black engineering tool case, a
large expandable telescoping xenology container, and a scorched metal thigh

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a purple photocopier, a round white rattan coffee table
with a glass top, Purr the humanoid service robot, Bert the old hefty blue
soldier felo, and Jewel the large violet glowing felo here.

morris just remember not everyone has the cash for a compresser, so that would
naturally make you get more points overall verses someone who hasn't.

That's true. However, I was still clearing enough points to make it possibly
less time consuming for more points. I actually ran a test out at Orion using
the compressor versus not using it. So you are correct, however I think the time
expenditure is still more, and no less than the same if you expel. I'll have to
try that method out though to tell you. And when I do, I won't even use the
compressor.

changelog
Recent Minor Changes:
-----
Attempting to make payments on an insurance policy that does not exist now does
nothing. Previously it would break so this is probably an improvement.
   Posted 6 days, 7 hours, and 10 minutes ago
-----
ArachnoPals will no longer eat in their sleep, and their descriptions will now
indicate if they're hungry or sleeping.
   Posted 5 days, 22 hours, 12 minutes, and 42 seconds ago
-----
Added the option 'Show Less Salvage Grappling Output' under general options.
   Posted 5 days, 53 minutes, and 9 seconds ago
-----
Asteroid supply kits, along with individual anchors and lines, have been removed
from stores. A new weapon has been added in their place that significantly
reduces bloat.
   Posted 2 days and 13 seconds ago
-----
Fans of tombs rejoice! Enclosed spaces filled with death are stinkier than ever.
Such smells can be reversed with air freshener or engaging environmental
controls.

[Starship "Blanche Schroeder"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a stretchy long-sleeved light blue top with a colorful dragonfly
print, a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans, and a pair of baby blue
leather clogs with a row of multicolored daisies across the toes. She is also
wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender
bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a
soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Starship "Blanche Schroeder"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Blanche Schroeder"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's

Subject: salvage, hopefully final discussion for a bit
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 00:57 25 August 2316 GST
--
So, I was checking the lifespan of these stations and see that stuff is going
down soon at 134. For the following reasons I would like us to try out 285 for
awhile.
1. It is a shorter flight and will hopefully cut down on new pilots getting into
jams with hostiles and falling asleep on the sometimes longer travel time.
2. While you get more points with starship debris, people seem to salvage the
roids and commets faster. Thus, would have more time to close the gap between
the two sets of earned points.
3. When we do salvage ops, they will most likely be at 285 anyway.
4. Pilots who cannot salvage the grade 50 debris can always go out of Orion or
earn industry in other ways.
5. There is an artifact spot at battle of mir in which we can set up a marker
beacon to aid in travel needs.
Thanks everybody who participated in the testing and even confusing discussion
pertaining to this station question. If you all have gripes, questions or
whatever, look me up.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Metal-rich Asteroid Surface.

ftl accord
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Shooting Star. Welcome to Accord space."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
/k7l6y9Tw|`VFEY`&gZs-ZSWmd($"pTXKaok3^GZ
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it
for a moment.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

out there is such a good idea. At Orion if it goes on emergency power, it's a
quick fix, but at 285? If it happens just 3 or 4 times you could more easily
lose it. Just my thought."

[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "800k who in the world got
cans that large?"
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Lily did, I guess."
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Starseeker's Beacon. Welcome to Accord space."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "I would prefer to defend, but
I'll salvage if need be."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Can I bring my medium
trnasport and salvage?"

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
(me<_*$EE%"I<)@L`"0\9Gi9F5Am2|\&SxzJ8wlv
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Celestial Explorer.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

[Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.

[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So everyone go to Belt of Orion
and I suppose we could go one sector north so I can at least add everyone."
[Tactical Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Bari spreader just passed
through starship museum according to the scanner."
"And Hi, Akemi." Kim Saunders smiles. "Sorry, did not mean to ignore you."

You ask, "Want me to stay here or go?"
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the

windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad. The hatch appears to be locked.

looking for threats. Somebody should have been checking Fringe space."

told them to wait but yes I suppose some chose to salvage."

have told Lily to wait more clearly. When shule said AEU was clear and no one
responded to my offer for help, Lily added me to the op. I should have waited,
and I didn't."

loud swearing.

[Starship "Raptor"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

[Starship "Raptor"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive, a temporary wormhole drive, an
improved temporary wormhole drive, and a swiveling black leather gunner's chair
here.
You can go north and down.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
(_+C:AzS2ta8{JTp\8iekY!o&dIm`Vx!O7l]IlHb
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
