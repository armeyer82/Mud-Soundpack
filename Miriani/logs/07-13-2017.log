You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

00:06 You notice Miriam Valleris using the radio to request launch clearance.

00:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hellion, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:06 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship and five planets have been detected in the sector."

00:06 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:06 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

00:06 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:06 Miriam Valleris inputs a set of coordinates into a small navigation console.

00:06 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 13, 7, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:07 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

00:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

00:07 Miriam Valleris pulls a small lever toward herself, deactivating the ship's systems.

If I see that it does not when we are crewing the fleet, I will have to leave it behind. I will be importing a profile containing information for each stage into the computers of all warships."

00:50 [General Communication] Aria Hunter transmits, "Understood."

00:51 [General Communication] Bradley Kind transmits, "Are there any other necessary upgrades? Also, what types of ships specifically would you like people to volunteer. There was some confusion about what you meant in regards to capabilities as well."

00:51 [General Communication] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "The armory ships don't have to have it, do they?"

00:51 [General Communication] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "I know you said warships, I just want to make it 100 percent clear."

00:52 [General Communication] High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle transmits, "By capabilities, I mean combat ship, rearming ship, repair ship, etc. Each starship needs a purpose and I'd like you to tell me where yours fits in. Ryan, rearming ships do not need NIRP, only warships."

00:52 [General Communication] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "Thank you."

00:53 [General Communication] Andreas Fierro transmits, "Is there a chance to add more rearming ships?"

00:53 [General Communication] High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle transmits, "Mr. Kind, no other specific upgrades are necessary, though I would prefer you to have Long range broadcast, and all combat upgrades. As for ships, anything works to rearm, I trust you you know about repairs, and for warships, I will only be accepting gunships and above. Any other starships will not be able to handle the level of complexity."

01:05 [AIE | Channel 1] Aria Hunter transmits, "The Praelor have a new ship, the Kritzn, that can disrupt the wormhole network, and temporarily redirect jumpgates, which makes it difficult to respond to invaded sectors. Their technology works like an interdiction filed, but has wider affects."

01:06 [AIE | Channel 1] Aria Hunter transmits, "They have targetted the catapolt in 32, in order to deprive us of that tool, and have been causing difficulties for HG in uncharted space far from home."

01:07 [AIE | Channel 1] Tristina Cantrell transmits, "This is definitely not good. What is there that I can do to assist with this?"

01:07 [AIE | Channel 1] Aria Hunter transmits, "Volunteer ships are also needed for rearming anrdrepair services, as are individuals to man the ships HG deems necessary."

01:10 #$#hjelp

01:11 [AIE | Channel 1] Aria Hunter transmits, "Essentially, we will be traveling through a series of jumpgates that bring you in contact with Praelor, one after another, clearing areas as we pass them. The purpose is to allow HG the chance to search for the lab unbothered by the Praelor.... In essence, we are distraction. The lab is known to exist, but it still isn't certain where it is or how secure it is. The possibility of intercepting a fleet of Kritzn is also anticipated."

01:13 #$#hjelp

01:13 [AIE | Channel 1] Aria Hunter transmits, "So... If you want to volunteer a ship, make sure it is filled with bard, has the appropriate upgrades, and mail a key to the captain, along with a letter outling what function it will serve, combat, repair, or rearming, and whether or not you wish to pilot it, but you must have a good justification as for why, as she'd prefer to keep us all together."

my dearest Love,
First, I'm quite surprised that you were upset with my being in your ship. Since i am the one who left, I find it perplexing that you took offense. i honestly thought that you would be pleased to find that i had returned. I thought you would be happy to see me and that we could at least discuss things. I also felt that it was the time the other night when I left that i felt that I was so ready to consumate my love with you. I had been thinking often lately of how i wanted to make love with you and how I'd just so much wish that we had the opportunity to just hangout for a couple of days and cuddle and make awesome love. I know that for me, i've always wanted that to be a special time, a special moment in our lives when I could express how I truly feel about you. I didn't want it to be just a casual experience as for me love-making isn't merely a physical act. For me, making love is the deepest possible emotional experience one can ever have. I expressed how heart-broken I was and I meant it because here I was finally ready. Then you turned your back on me.
I know Love it's not been an easy time for you to wait for me to be ready to be more physical. It's just that I wanted to be certain that you truly felt the same way and that when we did take that special journey into the depths of our love, that it would be the beginning of something which was everlasting.
I am so sorry for making the statements I did. I deeply am but don't you understand that what you did was deliberately hurtful? What had I done which was so wrong for you to seem as though you went out on a cheap and hurtful act to be cruel to me. How would you have felt if after hearing you express how hurt you were and sad, and then you discovered I was in a house which belongs to nobody which has a name that sounds like some sort of a house of ill repute or a place where pilots go to exploit sex? Yes, I looked up the property and it is to be auctioned. Obviously, whomever you are having your sexual escapades with doesn't have the decency to take you to her own place but must poach in a property which isn't hers. She was obviously added to the garage and Biometric lock so how sneaky. how can you trus that sort of judgement over mine? Oh too, how in two days can you say that you love someone else? Again, I don't feel remorseful for calling this person cheap and one I would not readily consider to have true feelings. There are women pilots around and yes I can name several, who will talk the talk and make you feel all warm and loved when they're just as much into the experience as you are for it's physical value. Love does not evolve overnight and you should know this. All I can ask of you my Darling is that you would please stop to consider that your actions were themselves hurtful. you didn't even seem to want to talk with me but gave me the cold shoulder for a wrong which I did not commit. I was so looking forward to being with you then and yes, as i said, I truly thought that you would see it that I wanted to show you forgiveness when you found me there. I had also placed a special bed in your ship for us. So no Love, it wasn't intended at all to be spiteful. I am shocked! because I also thought perhaps what you did was a sort of acting out. That you felt rejected by me perhaps and that by my returning to you and being available for you would show you how much I truly cared.
Please Honey, I truly believe that we should try to work out our issues. I thought that I meant enough to you that should we have differences, that you wouldn't just do something mean and hurtful like this as a form of 'getting even?' I truly don't understand as I had no idea that you were angry with me over anything? I'm not a mind reader Sweetheart. I am merely a human being who needs to be treated with reason. What you have done is not reasonable because you never even provided me with a means of defense. Still, the only thing which seems to be quite obvious is that you wanted sex? Well you were certainly about to have what i hoped would be a good time with me <smiles!>.
I know my Love, that i haven't been at work as much for the past couple of months as well. But you know if it had of been you, I would wait until the end of time for you. I would travel to the end of this Universe and beyond for you because I love you more than any man in the Universe. It would be worth the wait to me. It truly would be because I love you so much and you are worth it. Not because you are the handsomest man in the Universe as that's just a wonderful fringe benefit. If you weren't so handsome, I would still love everything about you. We have had interruptions in the time that when I have been here. When you decided to leave and then return, this took a lot of our timewhich we could have enjoyed together. I'm not blaming you for this, just merely pointing out that there have been circumstances beyond my control. Also, when I have been here, you've frequently been involved in space combat and I will admit that I have felt a bit ignored as you had many hours to work yet it seemed that work was more important so you show up around the time when I'm generally going to sleep. How is that enough time to begin our love-making journey?
There is an exception to my love for you and that is I don't love it how you flaunted your actions with someone else to hurt me. Yes I may forgive you for this in time though as I know that men are more physical and often do act out which seems to be what you have done especially if they don't think they are being satisfied. I am so deeply sorry Babe that you went to such lengths and when we are together again and I believe we will be, that you have my assurance that you can always express your concerns to me. You are free
01:40  to tell me everything you want and you should never hold back. I might not always be comfortable with what you say but we should always have open communications. Honesty is paramount in every relationship which works.
This is no way to call what we have over Love. Relationships are work but I am willing to listen to you and to do whatever it takes to please you. I so want this to work for us. I know that whomever you are with, that your rushing into things is most definitely not going to be good for you. How do you know that she hasn't drawn you in for other selfish reasons? I know that some women who are associated with pirates and other dishonest types will prey upon others who have assets and use sociopathic behavior to take advantage of someone like you. You are a very nice guy and easy-going and you are definitely a target. I love you honestly and sincerely and not for anything other than for you. Yourself had nothing when you met me and although what you have achieved is incredible, it's still a vulnerable spot for you as someone could take advantage of you very easily.
I will leave the garage access open to to you here at Empanda and i am enclosing a couple of starship keys. I just ask you never to bring anyone into my ships without my consent or unless they are mutual friends of ours.
I love you Tibo.
Your forever faithful,
Kitty

It truly would be because I love you so much and you are worth it. Not because you are the handsomest man in the Universe as that's just a wonderful fringe benefit. If you weren't so handsome, I would still love everything about you. We have had interruptions in the time that when I have been here. When you decided to leave and then return, this took a lot of our timewhich we could have enjoyed together. I'm not blaming you for this, just merely pointing out that there have been circumstances beyond my control. Also, when I have been here, you've frequently been involved in space combat and I will admit that I have felt a bit ignored as you had many hours to work yet it seemed that work was more important so you show up around the time when I'm generally going to sleep. How is that enough time to begin our love-making journey?
There is an exception to my love for you and that is I don't love it how you flaunted your actions with someone else to hurt me. Yes I may forgive you for this in time though as I know that men are more physical and often do act out which seems to be what you have done especially if they don't think they are being satisfied. I am so deeply sorry Babe that you went to such lengths and when we are together again and I believe we will be, that you have my assurance that you can always express your concerns to me. You are free to tell me everything you want and you should never hold back. I might not always be comfortable with what you say but we should always have open communications. Honesty is paramount in every relationship which works.
This is no way to call what we have over Love. Relationships are work but I am willing to listen to you and to do whatever it takes to please you. I so want this to work for us. I know that whomever you are with, that your rushing into things is most definitely not going to be good for you. How do you know that she hasn't drawn you in for other selfish reasons? I know that some women who are associated with pirates and other dishonest types will prey upon others who have assets and use sociopathic behavior to take advantage of someone like you. You are a very nice guy and easy-going and you are definitely a target. I love you honestly and sincerely and not for anything other than for you. Yourself had nothing when you met me and although what you have achieved is incredible, it's still a vulnerable spot for you as someone could take advantage of you very easily.
I will leave the garage access open to to you here at Empanda and i am enclosing a couple of starship keys. I just ask you never to bring anyone into my ships without my consent or unless they are mutual friends of ours.
I love you Tibo.
Your forever faithful,
Kitty

Her eyes are accented with smoky silver eyeshadow. She is wearing light red lip gloss on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted rose and adorned with slivers of black onyx and the nails on her right hand are painted rose and adorned with slivers of black onyx.
She is wearing a holographic short-sleeved dress made of a constant cascade of fluttering red rose petals.  She is wearing a pair of sexy black suede strappy heeled sandals with sparkling gems adorning the straps on her feet. She is wearing a black leather belt with a rose shaped buckle around her waist. She is also wearing a two-tone gold 
11:23 diamond-studded eternity ring, a round gold-trimmed locket on a silver chain, a rose gold signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, an emerald-studded sterling silver digital pocketwatch with a square crystal display, a simple white gold chain with a glowing crystal sphere encrusted with numerous precious gems dangling from it, a black leather purse with an ornate silver rose-shaped clasp, a black leather briefcase, a sparkly black suede diaper bag patterned with lions, a softly padded black snuggly, a light orange padded satin all-purpose sling, a compact silver Lore computer, two black metafrequency communication pins, a black metafrequency earpiece, a black metafrequency communicator, a wrist mounted astro-blaster, an ammunition storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a gray rolled toolkit, a black armor storage bag, an archaeological artifact storage container, a level one archaeological dig site scanner, a black spacesuit navigational computer, a black spacesuit jet, and a platinum Commoveo membership ring.
She is carrying an oddly-shaped EM pulse emitter in her right hand.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the eight-person gunship "Mischief", the ten-person battlecruiser "Retribution", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Ego Te Provoco" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid, Drew the droid, Carlie the

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the eight-person gunship "Mischief", the ten-person battlecruiser "Retribution", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Ego Te Provoco" landed here.

12:05 --------------------------------------------------
Extended Emotes
--------------------------------------------------
Extended emotes are a system that allows one to directly reference objects or other players in the world itself for a much greater sense of flexibility in the midst of roleplay. There are also a myriad of other features, which are detailed below:

* Replaces with your name. If there is no * in your emote, your name is automatically tacked on to the beginning.
*1 Replaces with your first name.
*2 Replaces with your last name.

-thing Matches to an object in the room. There is no space between the dash and the name. If you only want to use a player's first name, just stick a 1 after their name. If you capitalize your match string, it will appropriately capitalize the matching object. Examples:
    -albori1 would be replaced by "Albori"
    -toast would be replaced by "a slice of toast" if there is a slice of toast in the room
    -Toast would be replaced by "A slice of toast" if there is a slice of toast in the room.
~thing Functions in much the same way as - except it will strip 'a' or 'an' off the beginning of an object's name.
 It's worth noting that you cannot use another player as the very first item in an emote. Allowing this would create confusion when people thought that the player you were referencing was performing an action that they were not. For example: "-merugle gives * an enthusiastic high-five!" Using -merugle as the first word would not work because it would look like a standard emote from Merugle.

%he / %himself / %his / %him - Replaces with the appropriate word for the appropriate person. If you reference multiple objects or people (using dash thing, as described above), you can specify who you're talking about by adding a number after the %his. So for example, if I say: "-albori twirled -merugle, who pushed -lazurus, who ate a sandwich." you would refer to Albori with %he, Merugle with %she2 (or %he2, it doesn't matter), and Lazurus with %he3.

If you capitalize %he, %himself, %his, %him, etc, it will appropriately capitalize the replacement. Example:
    shakes -fred. %He2 is shaken.
becomes...
    Albori Isahost Sninvel shakes Fred Quantultoniel McElk. He is shaken.

* NOTE * Because of ambiguity issues, you should always use %him or %his instead of %her. Sorry ladies! (Don't worry, it'll get the right gender no matter which one you use.)

%{list} will allow you to randomize a very basic list of words. Spaces won't work (for the time being) anywhere between the {}'s, so it is an extremely crude facility for randomization. But it should suffice for now.
Example: %{a,list,of,words,goes,here}

Additionally, you can save your extended emotes for later by creating custom socials. Simply type @custom-socials and follow the prompts to store emotive strings as custom commands for easy access.

It's also possible to pipe a command throug
12:05 h with your extended emote, effectively allowing you to override the standard output of that command. For example, if you want to stand up in a spectacular fashion, you can override the stand command. To do so, you simply add a pipe character ('|') to the end of your text and then the command you want to execute. For example:

  *'s eyes widen in shock. He wobbles unsteadily before collapsing to the ground at -fred's feet. | collapse fred
  Albori Vanishing Point Sninvel's eyes widen in shock. He wobbles unsteadily before collapsing to the ground at Fred Quantultoniel McElk's feet.


A full list of commands can be found by typing 'emote pipes'. If you combine command piping with @custom-socials, the output of your commands will no longer be visible to you with your new emote. In the above example, you would no longer see yourself collapsing at Fred's feet, as the social took over that output.

For players who don't like the command piping system, you can enable a ROOM-OPTION to always show the output of standard commands regardless of what social a player used.

Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities.

14:53 Miriam Valleris says, "well, according to the history, the sector was calm"

14:54 You say, "Yeah"

14:54 You say, "But Fawkes and Cria are now both awake."

14:54 Miriam Valleris says, "They were before, too. They woke up just while we left. When the bc jumped in, they were two already"

14:56 You say, "I'm actually surprised they didn't shoot down my probe."

14:56 Miriam Valleris says, "maybe they didn't even see it"

14:57 You say, "Maybe."

14:57 Miriam Valleris says, "but well, they can't create us a surprise sector since they don't know where we go exactly"

14:57 Miriam Valleris makes a selection on a compact silver Lore computer.

14:57 Miriam Valleris exclaims, "Oh i can still track cria!"

14:57 Miriam Valleris says, "That's nice"

14:58 You ask, "And where in creation is that?"

14:58 Miriam Valleris presses some buttons on a destination finder.

14:58 Miriam Valleris says, "somewhere out of locals"

14:58 Miriam Valleris says, "who knows"

14:58 Cria Blur (H) (Male) is awake!

14:59 Miriam Valleris says, "But not out of 37 that's sure"

15:00 Miriam Valleris says, "In my opinion we should at least change the sector, but not via direct jump"

15:00 Miriam Valleris says, "If we don't give it a shot again that is"

15:01 You ask, "What do you mean?"

15:01 Miriam Valleris asks, "By waht exactly? the not by direct jump part, or the give it a shot part?"

15:01 Miriam Valleris grins.

15:01 #$#soundpack social | grin | female

15:01 You say, "The not by direct jump part."

15:01 Miriam Valleris says, "Oh, we just go to 1 1 1 or whatever, and go one sector west"

15:02 Miriam Valleris says, "or whatever"

15:02 Miriam Valleris says, "they can't trace us from there"

15:02 You ask, "So, go to 37 and go to 1 1 1  and then go west?"

15:02 Miriam Valleris says, "Na"

15:02 (Sector 37: Perspicuus Astrum) The ten-person battlecruiser "Killin' For Cash" has jumped into the sector.

15:03 (Sector 37: Perspicuus Astrum) The ten-person battlecruiser "Killin' For Cash" has left the sector.

15:03 Miriam Valleris says, "Or we stay in locals until they calmed down, but we change the planet or the sector"

15:03 Miriam Valleris says, "but so that they can't use their wormhole tracing thing"

15:04 You say, "Ah, ok"

15:04 Miriam Valleris says, "If not they will just sit there again and wait for us to either launch or to come out"

15:04 You say, "Yeah, true."

15:04 Miriam Valleris says, "What ever we do, we should do it without them being able to trace us"

15:04 You say, "Wonder if we could still leave out of like 35, or something. It'd be further away probably, but it might throw them off."

15:05 Miriam Valleris says, "so jumping out of here only via uncharted cause it's likely that they have a probe here"

15:05 Miriam Valleris says, "Hmmm"

15:05 You say, "Ah, ok"

15:05 You say, "I understand"

15:05 Miriam Valleris says, "better 36, that's closer to 37"

15:05 Miriam Valleris says, "or 38"

15:06 You say, "ok, 36 then and'Well, we can jump to 40 from here then to 38."

15:06 You say, "And leave out of there."

15:06 Miriam Valleris says, "cause the ftl range can't even reach 35 from 37, so"

15:06 You say, "oh, true"

15:07 You ask, "Do our wormholes show up on long-range scans?"

15:07 Miriam Valleris says, "No no"

15:07 You say, "oh, cool."

15:07 Miriam Valleris says, "only if they find the sector we used ftl in"

15:07 You say, "Ah, ok"

15:08 Miriam Valleris says, "that's why i say we go to uncharted from here, and jump where ever we want from uncharted"

15:08 You ask, "ok, so we go to 40, then jump to 38. Anywhere to land in 38 if we get in trouble?"

15:08 Miriam Valleris says, "we should maybe go the other way round"

15:08 Miriam Valleris says, "38 has a station but i don't think you can land there"

15:08 You say, "oh, ok"

15:08 Miriam Valleris says, "you can land in 35 though, in 36 too, and in 37 too"

15:09 You say, "Ah, ok"

15:09 Miriam Valleris says, "So we should come from sector 35 and leave from 36 if we don't want them to show up in 37"

15:09 You say, "right"

15:09 Miriam Valleris says, "or we leave from 37 and save a probe, but they probably guess that we went there"

15:09 You ask, "What's the easiest way to get to 35?"

15:10 Miriam Valleris says, "well, doesn't work from here"

15:10 You nod.

15:11 You say, "And then to 36 and we leave from there."

15:11 Miriam Valleris says, "here i would repeat the uncharted thing cause they will most likely check 35"

15:11 Miriam Valleris says, "and from there finally"

15:25 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion", the one-person expediter "Temporal Nexus", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Ego Te Provoco" landed here.
You see a shiny purple claw machine, Wiggles the droid, Sum the droid, Jimm the droid, Karli the droid, Stalker the droid, Nazma the droid, Peaches the droid, Prince the droid, Meo the droid, Ontanka the droid, Marina the droid, Lisa the droid, Punch the droid, Rat the droid, Android the droid, Fay the droid, Jazmin the droid, Twit the droid, Rar the droid,

16:00 ["Hellion" Control Room] (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Freistadt; Public Docking Bay.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a white fuzzy artifact storage container, and a holographic representation of the ship's computer here.

This station is rather barren, lone drones listlessly floating through the vicinity. It appears that this is some sort of neutral research base judging by the cautionary signs posted every few meters. No sign of human life can be observed here; the occupants of the station must be elsewhere.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

16:06 Lrscan
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  lrscan [config | <scan type>]

Description:
  Initiates a long-range scan of the area, allowing you to detect planets, starships, space stations, and wormholes from a distance. It should be noted that long-range scans are NON-SPECIFIC. This means that you won't be able to ascertain any kind of specific information, including names, damage levels, power sources, or whether or not a spatial body's characteristics classify it as a moon or a planet.

Optional Arguments:
  Config - This brings up a configuration menu, which allows you to filter your results, adjust the scanning range, and toggle the scanning mode.
  <Scan Type> - Allows you to specify exactly what you wish to scan for.

Examples:
>lrscan planets

>lrscan starships

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

16:35 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a white trash bin, an internal stun turret, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, and a white fuzzy artifact storage container here.

16:39 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Retribution" landed here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Retribution" landed here.
