a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its

small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control

Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and
has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled
calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips
are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth.
Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her
close-cropped, bristly hair is indigo and shaven down to stubble except for a
spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several
dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in
her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a
sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin
charm pierces her left upper ear, and a thick gold ring with a spider charm
pierces her right upper ear.
 She is wearing a finely crafted choker of polished rounded squares of blue and
gold dichroic glass, a black leather bustier decorated with jeweled obsidian
dolphins, a pair of heavy black leather forearm bands with eleven rows of very
long darkly gleaming steel spiked studs, a glittering gold chain of tiny linked
daggers around her waist, a pair of torn skinny black low rise jeans, and a pair
of chunky black leather boots with numerous straps and buckles. She is also
wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic
glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone
holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm
resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a glossy obsidian
wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted
linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in
gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with
a silver lightning bolt on the side, and a teal battle hummingbird stamp. Her
head, face, both eyes, both shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, and both hands
are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

l eve
Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and
has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled
calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips
are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth.
Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her
close-cropped, bristly hair is indigo and shaven down to stubble except for a
spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several
dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in
her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a
sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin
charm pierces her left upper ear, and a thick gold ring with a spider charm
pierces her right upper ear.
 She is wearing a finely crafted choker of polished rounded squares of blue and
gold dichroic glass, a black leather bustier decorated with jeweled obsidian
dolphins, a pair of heavy black leather forearm bands with eleven rows of very
long darkly gleaming steel spiked studs, a glittering gold chain of tiny linked
daggers around her waist, a pair of torn skinny black low rise jeans, and a pair
of chunky black leather boots with numerous straps and buckles. She is also
wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic
glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone
holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm
resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a glossy obsidian
wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted
linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in
gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with
a silver lightning bolt on the side, and a teal battle hummingbird stamp. Her
head, face, both eyes, both shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, and both hands
are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and
has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled
calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips
are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth.
Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her very
short, bristly hair is indigo and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey
mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red
cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her
hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a
sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin
charm pierces her left upper ear, and a thick gold ring with a spider charm
pierces her right upper ear.
 She is wearing a finely crafted choker of polished rounded squares of blue and
gold dichroic glass, a black leather bustier decorated with jeweled obsidian
dolphins, a pair of heavy black leather forearm bands with eleven rows of very
long darkly gleaming steel spiked studs, a glittering gold chain of tiny linked
daggers around her waist, a pair of torn skinny black low rise jeans, and a pair
of chunky black leather boots with numerous straps and buckles. She is also
wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic
glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone
holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm
resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a glossy obsidian
wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted
linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in
gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with
a silver lightning bolt on the side, and a teal battle hummingbird stamp. Her
head, face, both eyes, both shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, and both hands
are left uncovered.
She is carrying a small red and white bag of room temperature cheesy popcorn in
her right hand, and a chilled margarita garnished with a slice of lime in her
left hand.

l asteria
a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. It is asleep. Its stomach is
bulging, but it seems content to slowly digest its large meal.

[Starship "Wuthering Fights"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

[Starship "Wuthering Fights"; Weapons Room One]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting
Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.

awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
