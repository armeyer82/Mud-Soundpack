Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Living Quarters Six]
Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a compact red
refrigerator, a small seashell pink trash can, an insulated green cooler, a
small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated orange cooler, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, a purple nylon mesh shopping bag, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard
snuggly labeled 'Asteria' here.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
The starship has arrived on the very limits of a solar system, the first point
where the local star's influence on gravity is anything more than negligible.
The star itself is merely a distant glinting point, indistinguishable from any
of the millions of distant but brighter stars also in view. This is an Oort
cloud, a massive sphere of captured comets, asteroids, and similar interstellar
flotsam.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

We arrived here after traveling 5.7 LTC from the last stop. Debris grade was 60
to 70, all superheated masses. Luminosity was slightly less than Sol-equivalent.
I took an image, and then set us back on course 203 30.

After having traveled close to 13 ltc since last stop, we spotted Hall of regret
south southeast and very slightly down. What you can expect from this type of
starship wreckage, grade 80, 90 and 100. Put the photo in the metal contaqiner
and set us back on heading 203 30.

purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and coral rocks
Samantha the old large violet felo
It appears to be at Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Main Deck; Mid.
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in average-length, striped
violet fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth.
The felo's long, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, hooked white
claws visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of bright green eyes with
horizontal pupils. It is wearing a sparkling diamond collar and a tiny purple
six-legged spacesuit body. It also has a pair of lavender satin tail ribbons
tied in bows.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Living Quarters Six]
This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced
with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and
the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air,
thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. A thick band that stretches across
all of the walls at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with Nekomata the
sleeping medium-sized blue twin tailed felo on it, a white four poster rattan
bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of
lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed
pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst
flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a
large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a compact red refrigerator, a
small seashell pink trash can, an insulated green cooler, a small red ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow

There is a momentary pause from the gunfire and then the shooting resumes.
A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock
rifle slung over his shoulder.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

a metallic gold touch einrophone
This is an Einstein-Rosen telephone. It has a clever touch screen, saving your
fingertips from the wear and tear that comes with pressing buttons on a keypad.
It covers nothing.
The device is warm to the touch and the screen shows only a random collection of
pixels.
A metallic gold touch einrophone also reports that there are unread messages in
OOC/General/SC, General/Name Changes, General/Philosophy, General/Trading,
OOC/Messages To The Staff, OOC/General/All, and Local Ship Message Board/Zéro
Des Cartes/General.
A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

Anfisa charted our position. Helios was 89.57 LTC westsouthwest and very
slightly down of our position. While we've had very few diversions to visit
sites of interest lately, the silver lining is it helps us make good time.

luminosity and grade 90-100 debris. We took a photograph. There were no planets,
as is usual for this kind of site.

the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air,
thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. A thick band that stretches across
all of the walls at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startingly like a single
unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass
is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a
glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created
here.

The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into
quickly evaporating smoke.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship

forget to pick it up."

calculations every seccycle as I depart into the abyss."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well we want to establish a fund to
support AEU citizens who can't afford medical care via the creche."
Luja says to Anfisa of Marzore in a Filipino accent, "How can you do that? I can
barely count subcycles!"

rich people, like three billion credit spiders."

comes along that you would like to have."
Luja Garland exclaims in a Filipino accent, "It's what I hear about points, too.
One trip to whatever for a couple of hours nets them as much points as I have in
aggregate. It's insane!"

certain ships and upgrades could cost, I was a bit shocked as well, but the more
experienced you are, the more your income with rise with your needs."

Luja says very calmly, "I am never going to touch anything on this ship in case
I break anything."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Wow, 15 bilion. Yeah well,
exploration upgrades and ships are the top thing, but then exploration,
especially these trips, pay very well and make it worth it."
The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

She appears to be 20 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has tan skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and
attractive calves. She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average
breasts. Her face is round and somewhat pretty, with an average nose and dimpled
chin. Her lips are full and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set
of slightly yellowed teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes
are green and wide. Her shoulder-length, slightly curly hair is dark blonde and
parted on the side and smoothed back behind her ears. She has neatly trimmed
clear fingernails. She has a large black satin bow in her hair.
 She is wearing a mystic purple synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars
printed on the upper right arm, an expensive silver watch with diamond accents,
and a pair of dark red synthleather ship boots with elastic side panels. She is
also wearing a light purple cotton drawstring purse, a delicate ring of silver
wire and small pink quartz crystals, a delicate blue crystal necklace, a
wrist-mounted chronometer, and a metallic green touch einrophone in a black
leather phone holster. Her head, face, both eyes, left wrist, and both hands are

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no
atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large
floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some
alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it
for a moment.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.

brilliantly colored patchwork fabric, an emerald green armchair with a hand-made
purple and sapphire star quilt on it, a long table dressed with a fancy white
cloth decorated with an overall gold fleur-de-lys design, a very large glossy

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new

accent, "I could go to Feng Wood and drop a beacon at hall of pain on way, but
dunno if anyone would really use it."
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

generally head out from Campeche."
Lily Kaise nods.
A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tongue out from its perch on Anfisa,
Renegade AI's shoulder.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah we had 270 -20 or so and then
another 100 to Hall of Pain which was 270 0."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "What."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "-20 is far too low."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I think that Hall of Pain is 250 form
Campeche total."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Right?"
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "-2 is basically okay."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "You can use 270 0 and be fine
usually too."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "Where did that -20 come from."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Because I didn't have a more exact
heading. I just had 270 and very slightly down."
Nekomata the medium-sized blue twin tailed felo jumps down from a soft square
dark blue rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "'or more like South and very slightly

from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains
of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. A thick band that stretches
across all of the walls at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pair of soft lavender silk bikini panties and a pair of soft
light blue slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten
on the side, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick
lizard named Asteria. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest,
back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left
uncovered.

floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some
alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the

The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like

The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

I asked the the people in alliance space for the news, and they sent a reply
that they will send a hypercast at 2300 today. I guess there's enough to merit
going to the trouble of aiming the Torus.
They will likely need to adjust their aim, so we should be ready to give them
help with that.

Luja did the approach for this one. It was about 6.5 LTC from the last stop. We
charged back up to 50% charge here, since I figured 10 cycles of charge would be
plenty for getting to Helios with. Even if it isn't, the furnace has one more
full charge of wear left on it and we've got a lot of debris in the storage
room, so we're in great shape.
This place wasn't anything remarkable. Grade 70 and 80 debris, no luminosity. I
took a photo. When we were done running the furnace and restocking the debris,
we left on course 203 -5 again. Torus extra long-range NDB signal strength was
66%.

Since the riftflow was swinging around to be directly in our path, I slightly
adjusted the course to 195 -5 so as to maintain a good speed. After the flow
finishes its shift, we can adjust to 211 -5 for a similar distance to correct. I
normally wouldn't even mention a small adjustment like this, but I'm tired and
if I doze off I wanted to be sure anyone could adjust the course back when the
conditions are good for it.
We covered 2.5 LTC before I adjusted the course.

A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in.
As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and
shrapnel.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

Subject: More About Galleonic Sails
Author: Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec
Posted: 04:29 25 September 2316 GST
--
I talked a bit about the extra sails on masts of galleon in previous postings,
but maybe some more details would be useful, just in case.
Mainsail: Is the one in the middle, all you can do with it is change trim to
change speed of vessel. Very standard. Will stay at 100% trim most of time
unless trying to sneak away from Outsider patrol or someone is having very hard
time approaching an oort cloud.
Jib: Is the sail on forward mast, perhaps the most complex one. Here are jib
tips depending on various rift conditions.
-Very favorable flow, speed of galleon is over ninety percent of flow itself: Is
suggested to set trim at 100% and match heading of the ship (Usually 36 2 in
this case). This will not increase or decrease speed, but will reduce drift very
slightly.
-Sideway flow, speed of galleon around half of flow: Jib can do nothing here,
set trim to 0%, else ship will slow down for no benefit.
-Flow in the face, speed of galleon around a third of flow: This is exciting
moment for jib, set it at 100% and set an heading on it that is somewhat
diagonal to flow, kind of a tacking heading. Don't forget elevation and don't
hesitate to experiment with the heading a bit to get best speeds. Related to
that, flow will always be turning around slowly, so come back to jib often
during slow speeds for slight adjustments that will provide slightly more speed.
Mizzen: That is sail at rear of vessel, mostly used to reduce drift at cost of
some speed. Note that heading of it must always match the one of ship for it to
have best effect. It is best used if flow is sideway or ship is in a storm,
those conditions are the most drifty and can push ship around a lot. This is bad
for aquarium, so the significant speed lose in storm might well be worth it.
Otherwise, mizzen can also be used to make approaching a location easier,
especially if in a storm. Have someone back there to keep heading match.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure
xenology storage container, a small blue bioplastic ship light (casting a soft
blue glow), a dark brown leather captain's chair, a small square dark brown
rattan table with a glass top, an interdictor launcher, Nestor the humanoid
service robot, a cardboard box labeled 'Here be keys', an orange plastic box
labeled 'Felo Chow', a soft square dark blue rug with a luxuriously deep pile
and thick gold fringe, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a small
natural golden brown trash bin, a metal container, Magellan the arachnoid
security robot, Samantha the old large violet felo, and Nohr the obese black
horned felo here.
Soraya Rhyz is sitting on a blue velvet sectional sofa. Keegan Wantz is sitting
on Soraya Rhyz's lap. Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south, up, and out.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no
atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large
floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some
alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.

A hairy black and purple striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named Webster jerks his
limbs, springing into the air briefly.
You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night.
Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
A hairy black and purple striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named Webster skitters
out.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
A reptilian-like creature flies overhead, producing a melodic trill as it

The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
A hairy black and red striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named Araignée skitters
into the area.

The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and
closing. It then abruptly swims off.
The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

Five tetras dart around in formation, and then weave around the plastic diver.
The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.
Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water
to swirl tremendously.
The water calms slightly as the thing carrying the fishbowl slows its pace.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
The tunnel around the ship shudders, and a gush of blood is suddenly filling it.
With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the
tunnel.

Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a

Spotted at 22.07 LGC out at a heading of WNW and VSU, and 8.02 LTC travelled.
Dropped out of the rift to image it at about 8.85 LTC. Started back up.

Anfisa placed Helios at 27.16 LTC to the southwest and slightly down. I set the
course for 214 -24. Helios NDB strength at the time was 30%, while the Torus
extra long-range NDB strength was 57%.

The riftflow moved around to blow from westsouthwest, and was slowing us down
somewhat. I adjusted the course from 214 -24 to 225 -24 and adjusted the jib a
little to help. We had covered 12.55 LTC when I adjusted the course. We made
some good time this shift thanks to a storm that was blowing mostly our way.
