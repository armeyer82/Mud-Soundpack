The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

Artifact Hunting
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Artifact hunting is the process of flying into uncharted space and searching for pieces of alien civilizations that have been left behind.
NOTE:
Artifact hunting is scheduled to be completely redone in the future. This information will no longer be valid when this occurs, and is consequently the reason artifacts are so low in worth.
  What You Need:
A full spacesuit.
A spacesuit jet.
A spacesuit navaid.
A starship with adequate charge.
NAVI
GMU
Artifact storage container (not required but HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
  What To Do:
Basically, type NAVI in your control room and pick a direction. You will arrive outside of local space when you are 50 LY away from one of the known sectors of human space. When your computer announces the presence of an artifact, STOP your ship. 
NOTE: Using triggers for this is illegal. Please see POLICY 4.
  Retrieving an Artifact:
Move your ship as close as possible to the artifact. Now go into your airlock, CYCLE it, and step outside for a spacewalk. LOOK at your NAVAID and take note of the direction the artifact is in. Now spacewalk to it (this is accomplished exactly the same way as manual navigation in a starship) and GET the artifact. Now return to your ship (ENTER it normally) and continue your journey.
  Dangers
Going out of local space or out of comms is not without its dangers. Unexplored sec
02:28 tors are often home to large objects that cannot be detected early enough to avoid, thus causing damage to any component they may encounter. Another obstacle is the dreaded anomaly, which renders sensors barely functional and causes a general mess with navigational systems. Another navigational pitfall comes in the form of nebulae (see HELP NEBULA). As you fly further into uncharted territory, you may begin to encounter starships. Be they friend or foe, nobody knows...
  Help, I'm Out of Charge!
No need to panic. Luckily, escape pods have an enormous FTL range and can return you to civilization. If you want to someday come back for your ship with another ship, type ESCAPE. This will launch your escape pod and leave your ship intact. If you doubt you'll ever find your ship again, type SELF-DESTRUCT to destroy your ship and return home.
  Getting Paid
Now that you're back in communications range, you will need to find an artifact research center. Once you do that, type RESEARCH CONTAINER to research your artifact storage container. If you didn't buy a container, RESEARCH the artifacts one at a time.

A tall mountain of cracked brown rock has been rising steeply from the planetary surface for some time. You have at last come to the peak of the rise and discover that you are standing on what appears to be a dormant volcano. The rim is only a few feet wide, and the inner wall of rock plunges sharply down into the shadowy caldera at the volcano's center. Due to the looming sides of the mountain, it is impossible to see down into the volcano. However, no sulfurous stench or plume of steam seems to be emanating from it.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

10:40 [Newbie] Tristan Troniss: Oh. I typed transfer in the atmo salveger. It propablly transfered it to my ship then.

Proprietary Sensor Blob
--------------------------------------------------
The Hale Proprietary Sensor Blob is a patch to a starship's operating system that allows it to gather information about a specific type of Praelor vessel. To get the additional reward, you should get a scan of a Praelor Trajrrk from one unit away both while it's cloaked and while it's uncloaked.
The following text is quoted from the Galactic News and may shed additional light on the subject:
With the emergence of the newest Praelor vessel, known only as a Praelor Trajrrk, High Guard Command has been scrambling for any information that could lead to countering this new threat.
The Trajrrk, first encountered early last week by civilian pilot Kylar Knight, appears to have the ability to disguise itself as a piece of ordinary debris. More disturbing, it also appears to have the ability to fool sensors into believing that other objects are debris. Several reports have confirmed that these ships immediately hide the jumpgate to human space when a human starship enters, leading to speculation that the Praelor may seek to disrupt the ability of the High Guard to deploy and maintain jumpgates into enemy territory.
With such a dangerous new advantage, it appears that the Alliance High Guard has teamed up with the Hale Collective to develop methods of detecting these ships. As reported previously, the Praelor have come into possession of specialty technology developed by the Hale. While their previous position has been to deny all knowledge, the Hale Collective has finally spoken up about their specialty technology and confirmed that it deals with the concealment of starships and "other objects" from ship sensors.
While there have yet to be any breakthroughs between the High Guard and the Hale, the research group responsible for the project has put out a software patch that they say will gather valuable information about the Praelor's adaptation of the technology. Civilian pilots are encouraged to install this update (a small installation fee may apply) to assist in the research. High Guard Command has announced that they are willing to increase the mission reward for ships that gather reliable scans. According to Denise Bensby, scanning is as simple as getting within one unit of the Praelor ship and performing an ordinary sensor scan. In order to qualify for the extra reward, High Guard Command requires one one-unit scan while the ship is cloaked and one one-unit scan while the ship is not cloaked. The patch is available to all pilots on Saturn in a makeshift research facility.
When prompted, representatives from both High Guard Command and the Hale Collective declined to comment with further details about this new ship or, indeed, any further information regarding the situation.

13:40 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

13:40 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:40 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

13:40 The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."

13:40 For a top, you are wearing a navy blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of faded blue jeans with metal studs around the back pockets over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, an antique gold wedding band engraved with intertwining hearts, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface.

13:40 You are carrying a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in your right hand.

13:40 You are carrying a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in your right hand.

13:40 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:40 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

13:48 [Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Living Room] (indoors) (sitting on a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa)
You see nothing special. You see a small flat disc containing the image of Santa Claus hanging on the wall.
You see EmmyLou the droid, Estelle the droid, a massive sandstone fireplace with a mosaic tile hearth and a teakwood mantel, a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses, a coral ocean waters scented candle, and a small snow globe on a white base with a cheery-looking Santa brandishing a candy cane depicted inside sitting on top of it, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte gold lamp, a shiny purple starship simulator, a stack of neatly split logs, and a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You can go northwest, northeast, east, and south.

Angelus Secondary Landing Site Gives Pilots a Taste of Desert Life
------------------------------------------------------------------
In a controversial move which has local ranchers and farmers up in arms, the global governing body of Angelus green lighted a secondary landing site earlier today. The capital planet of the Commonwealth alliance draws pilots from across the galaxy to its sprawling pyramidal spaceport which boasts modern facilities for pilots and governing officials alike. On Sunday, Black Sands Point was opened to the public, and its landing site was officially registered with Angelus flight control.
Black Sands Point is a desert community located in the northeastern quadrant of the planet. Half a world away from the urban center surrounding the spaceport, Black Sands Point is a small town nestled in the desert foothills of a small mountain range. What once was a dot on the map has grown over the past few years into a thriving community focused on green living and clean energy. Regional government officials are hoping that the down-to-earth lifestyle will draw tourists into the little town and draw their credits into Commonwealth banks.
The agricultural community opposed the move in a series of town halls held over the past two years. Concerns about increased air traffic and the potential for urban sprawl dominated the debates. The Commonwealth has always had a strong foundation in agriculture, and some se
14:30 e the secondary landing site as a government ploy to gain credits at the expense of the people. For now, visiting pilots seem enchanted with the rough-and-tumble community, and there has been no comment from government officials about expanding interalliance access to other areas of Angelus at this time.

The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

14:36 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

14:36 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

14:36 You peer down and see...

14:37 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:37 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

14:37 [Chatter] Tristan Troniss transmits, "How did you crash your salvager hans?"

14:37 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

14:37 The starship is already moving.

14:37 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

14:37 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:37 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

14:37 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

14:37 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

14:37 The sensors are unable to pinpoint the starship's current coordinates.

14:37 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

14:37 The ship needs to be in space to move.

14:37 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

14:37 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.
The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand
15:13  double heart diamond anklet.

15:27 ["Jellyfish" Control Room] (indoors)
This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

15:31 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.

16:10 There are no damaged components.

16:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Jellyfish, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:10 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

16:10 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:10 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

16:10 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:10 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:10 Invalid direction.

16:10 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:11 The starship is already moving.

16:11 The three-person heliogaster "Galactic Rainbow" has jumped into the sector.

16:11 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:11 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:11 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:11 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:11 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:11 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:11 The ship needs to be in space to move.

16:49 [Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

16:52 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

16:52 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

16:52 I don't understand that.

16:52 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:52 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:52 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:52 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

16:52 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

16:52 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:52 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:52 You're already sitting down.

16:52 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:52 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

16:52 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:53 #$#soundpack_pong

16:53 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

16:53 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:53 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:53 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:53 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:53 The computer announces, "A planet and a space station have been detected in the sector."

16:53 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:53 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 3, 3."

16:53 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:53 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:53 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:53 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

16:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

16:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:53 I don't understand that.

16:53 You remove a protective component container from a black leather briefcase.

16:53 [Chatter] John Frazier transmits, "Am I to assume you don't think its worth that much by your reaction?"

16:53 You must stand up first.

16:53 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

16:53 You must stand up first.

16:56 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

16:56 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:56 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

16:56 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:56 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

16:56 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:56 [Chatter] John Frazier transmits, "Its a space suit."

16:56 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:56 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:56 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:56 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:56 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

16:56 A small handheld radio receiver

16:56 At first glance, this appears to be a collection of odd devices and components held together in a small clear case. Closer examination reveals that the items inside have been wired, mounted, or otherwise fused to create a functional piece of equipment. A cord with a common data port can be extended from the corner on one edge, and a crude display screen is located off center near the bottom of the front panel.
The display indicates that 0 transmissions have been recorded.
You estimate that to be worth 0.00 credits and 0 points.

16:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

Sabotage Devices
--------------------------------------------------
Relativity Damper: Reduces the amount of microwave radiation inside the resonance cavity, decreasing the radiation pressure and slowing down the drive.
Cannon Ignition Inhibitor: Disables the electrical charge that gets applied to bardenium upon launch. The cannons will still fire, but the bardenium will remain uncharged, vastly reducing its damage potential.
Energy Deefficiencifier: Wastes energy into heat. Affected ships will find their charge drains faster.
Sensor Bandwidth Inhibitor: Sensors (scan, focus, starmap, etc) will take longer to retrieve data.
Exotic Matter Contaminator: Taps into the exotic matter lines and introduces contaminates. This causes wormhole jumps to fail 50% of the time. It can only be used 3 times before the supply of contaminates runs out and the device is rendered inert.
External Communication Jammer: Silences the external communication system.
Internal Communication Jammer: Silences the PA system.
Internal Communication Monitor: Transmits PA messages to a source up to 1 LY away. This device REQUIRES the use of a remote activator, which is where transmissions will be relayed through.
Autopilot Scrambler: Has a 50% chance of causing autopilot to behave as if the ship was in a sector with sensor interference.
Manual Navigation Scrambler: Has a 50% chance to cause the ship to fly in a random direction instead of the inte
17:01 nded direction.

Sabotage
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
The recent trend in self-industrialization afforded by asteroid mining has given rise to a number of new devices. Among these are several devices that can be used to interfere with, or suppress, the standard functions of a starship's operations. These aptly named 'sabotage devices' are portable and easy to hide in a ship's systems, making them ideal for covert operations that require a target starship to become incapacitated for a short period of time.
  Usage
First, make sure you have at least 3000 license points. It will require that many to actually use the device, but it may require more if you intend to build it yourself. But for our purposes we're merely using it, so make sure you have 3000 or more. Then...
1.) Pick a room to install the device in. Some devices may require that they be installed in a certain type of room. These should be fairly obvious (weapon sabotage likely goes in a weapon room) and will be left as an exercise to the reader.
2.) Access the room's maintenance panel with the PANEL command.
3.) Install the device with the INSTALL command.
4.) Make a visit to the starship's control room or engineering room and write down the ship's current maintenance code with the MAINTENANCE command.
5.) Initialize your device with the INITIALIZE command. This will require the maintenance code that you wrote down earlier.
6.) Activat
17:04 e the device with the ACTIVATE command or a remote activation device. (Note that a remote activation device will require 12,500 points to use.)
  Remote Activation
Certain devices can be left dormant until you choose to activate them from afar. A remote activation device will allow you to activate your sabotage devices from within the same sector. You simply USE the activation device and select the sabotage device that you wish to activate.
  Maintenance Code Gotchas
Starship maintenance codes are security measures employed to ensure that only authorized users can perform maintenance on any given ship. As such, the maintenance code will change each time it's used, or each time the starship is powered up. You will likely not be able to obtain a maintenance code for a ship and store it for later use, as the code can change often and invalidate any previous codes. As such, each device you install in a ship will require a different maintenance code from the others.
  Removal
Removing the devices is as simple as opening the PANEL and using the UNINSTALL command. The device's internal electronics will be destroyed, rendering it useless.

17:05 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

17:19 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: It's also worth noting, Jason, if you're doing that activity, I'm told it's prudent to obtain a Destination Finder.

17:27 [Newbie] Jason Dolfert: Can I check which ships have it before buying them?

17:27 [Newbie] Moiraine Yobi: I meant, a different ship. An upgraded ship. Sorry. I wasn't clear in my response. That's what I get for one word.

17:50 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

18:17 [Newbie] Jason Stone: I do see uncharted and unclaimed. Maybe that'll change when I get out of the locals.

18:17 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: You need enhanced sensors to see if it was explored or not.

18:20 ["Saving Myself" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an internal stun turret and a video probe printout for Uncharted Space here.

19:11 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a tall red captain's chair, a tall red co-captain's chair, and three translucent blue security drones here.

20:06 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Fractious Malcontent", the six-person sentinel "Song of Dragon Fire Lightning", the six-person destroyer "Nibbles", the six-person destroyer "Magical Melody", and the three-person heliogaster "Galactic Rainbow" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, Beta the droid, Mjolnir the droid, Strike the droid, Sinister the droid, Booboo the droid, and a long sleeve black leather body suit with a red neckline and sleeves here.

20:08 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

20:08 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

20:08 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

20:08 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:09 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

20:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:09 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

20:09 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

20:09 There are no ships here.

20:09 You can't go that way.

20:09 The ship is already moving.

20:09 The ship is already moving.

20:09 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:09 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:09 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:09 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:09 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

20:09 The ship must be in space to do that.

20:09 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

20:09 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:09 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 9, 9, 9."

20:09 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:09 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:09 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:09 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

20:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:09 You must stand up first.

20:09 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

20:10 [Summit; Public Docking Bay] (indoors)
This spotless docking bay is large and features a sophisticated retractable roof. The walls are comprised of solid glass and give a dazzling view of the sector beyond. The roof is designed to retract into the walls and supporting brackets when a ship is coming in to dock, and will expand and seal itself in a matter of seconds. Illumination is provided by carefully placed lights along the outer-most portion of the ceiling and floor. One unique feature of the lighting system is the lights dimming as a starship is coming in to dock and when the ceiling retracts into the walls. Several cleaning drones whiz about, tidying things up as they move.

This spotless docking bay is large and features a sophisticated retractable roof. The walls are comprised of solid glass and give a dazzling view of the sector beyond. The roof is designed to retract into the walls and supporting brackets when a ship is coming in to dock, and will expand and seal itself in a matter of seconds. Illumination is provided by carefully placed lights along the outer-most portion of the ceiling and floor. One unique feature of the lighting system is the lights dimming as a starship is coming in to dock and when the ceiling retracts into the walls. Several cleaning drones whiz about, tidying things up as they move.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Summit; Public Docking Bay. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.

--------------------------------------------------
A starship communication relay is a transmitter that allows your ship to relay transmissions to authorized users up to 10 lightyears away. Essentially it's a private communication channel centered around a starship crew rather than a private organization or an alliance. The relay itself must be constructed with the asteroid mining construction facility. Once you have the upgrade installed, the following commands apply:
CHANNEL - When used in the control room, allows you to enable/disable the relay, authorize communicators, and deauthorize communicators. 
TR SHIP <message> - Transmits to the ship's private channel.
NOTE: The relay will only function within 10 lightyears of the ship.

20:38 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

20:38 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

20:39 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

20:39 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

20:39 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

20:39 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

20:39 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:39 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

20:39 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:39 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

20:39 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

20:39 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:39 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:39 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:39 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:39 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

20:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

20:49 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Summit; Public Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and a metallic silver starship simulator here.

20:52 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Summit; Public Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and a metallic silver starship simulator here.
You can go south.

20:59 You authorize Tibo Beauchene's communicator.

20:59 Your communicator rapidly beeps three times as it's paired to the ship.

20:59 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

20:59 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

20:59 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

20:59 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

20:59 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

20:59 The ship is already moving.

20:59 The ship is already moving.

20:59 [Chatter] Drew Berry transmits, "Go on a diet, get some of it sucked out by a vacuum cleaner."

20:59 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:59 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:59 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:59 [Chatter] Bob Smith transmits, "Fat people need loven too."

20:59 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:59 The ship must be in space to do that.

20:59 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

20:59 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:59 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

20:59 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

20:59 [Chatter] Drew Berry transmits, "Fat people need some self discipline."

20:59 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

20:59 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.
(Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has initiated an intrasector slip.

20:59 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

20:59 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:59 Current coordinates: 2, 6, 1

20:59 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

20:59 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has left the sector.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:59 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

21:00 #$#soundpack_pong

21:00 #$#soundpack_lag 102

21:00 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

21:00 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:00 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:00 The starship is already moving.

21:00 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:00 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:00 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

21:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

21:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:00 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The ten-person battlecruiser "Palace of Shadow" has launched from Rolukssica.

21:00 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

21:00 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand

Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand

22:14 Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand double heart dia

23:30 ["Al Nar" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an overstuffed gold gunner's chair, a violet armchair, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest.

23:51 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors

23:51 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, and a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars here.
You can go south and out.

23:51 A deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars starts to follow you.

23:51 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:51 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

23:51 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:51 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

23:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

23:51 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

23:51 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

23:51 The five-person transverser "Enchanting Melody" has launched from Rolukssica.

23:51 The computer reports the five-person transverser "Enchanting Melody" is one unit away from this ship.

23:51 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:51 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:51 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:51 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:52 #$#soundpack_pong

23:52 #$#soundpack_lag 104

23:52 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:52 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:52 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:52 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

23:52 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)
Current Coordinates: (18, 19, 8)

23:52 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:52 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:52 The ship is already on autopilot.

23:52 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

23:52 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:52 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

23:52 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

23:52 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:52 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

23:52 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

23:52 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:52 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:52 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:52 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:52 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

23:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

23:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:52 You can't power down the starship in space.

23:52 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Anyone for advance?"

23:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:52 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:52 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

23:53 Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand double heart dia
