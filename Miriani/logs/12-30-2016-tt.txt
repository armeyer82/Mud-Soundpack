Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the
collar, a plain white spacesuit top, a pair of plain white spacesuit gloves, a
plain white spacesuit bottom, and a pair of plain white spacesuit boots. She is
also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a
slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in
a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick
lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', a sturdy navy blue canvas AEU backpack, a
reactionless spacesuit jet, and a spacesuit navaid. Her head, face, and both
eyes are left uncovered.
She is carrying a plain white spacesuit helmet in her right hand, and a bulky
high-energy plasma explosive in her left hand.

[Starship "Courageous"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
