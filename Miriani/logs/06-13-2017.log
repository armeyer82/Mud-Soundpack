00:33 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

00:33 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Muzano the droid, Ralf the droid, Rika the droid, Aria the droid, a glossy red security drone, a glossy green security drone, a slim violet security drone, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Puff the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Ponyo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Blossom t

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

00:33 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:33 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

00:33 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

00:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

00:33 You remove a droid remote titled "Empanda" from a black leather briefcase.

00:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:33 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:33 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:33 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.
A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

00:33 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:33 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:33 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

00:33 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:33 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

00:33 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

Planets: (4, 4, 7)

Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)

Current Coordinates: (17, 6, 19)

00:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:34 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:34 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

00:34 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:34 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

00:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

00:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:34 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has docked with Empanda Station.

00:34 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:34 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

No need to worry! Insanity has been disbanded. I think this was probably the shortest war ever.
Not to say we won't continue to hunt Fawkes and Cria, but the Insanity threat has been neutralized.
Have a fantastic day.

The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

20:09 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

20:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:09 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

20:26 ["Your Sweetest Downfall" Weapons Room 2]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a comfy white soft fabric combat chair, and a large stuffed starship here.
You can go west.

20:27 ["Your Sweetest Downfall" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a comfy white soft fabric engineer's chair, and a black china platter of soft butter cookies here.
You see Amy Draksen (sitting on a comfy white soft fabric engineer's chair) and Diana West here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

22:11 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
