My Dearest Love,
Well it is so hard to write letters like this. We really need to be face to face and talk things over. I know that we have both made a lot of assumptions because you ended things so abruptly without even talking with me this is what started this chain of awfulness.
Please my Love, please do not end your career until we have at least gotten together in person to talk face to face. You owe it to yourself and I should honestly pray to the stars that you would think that I'm worth it.
Yes, take that woman back to where she belongs and then i'll be waiting for you.
I will be more than happy to accompany you to go back out of locals if this is what you want to do to earn funds to replace things or whatever but ew must please, we must get together face to face. writing letters does not convey the proper tone nor expression and it's not fair to either of us not to try.
I love you and will forever and there will be no other man for me.
I love you,
Kitty

16:27 ["Starlight Express" Living Quarters 1] (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows)

The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
