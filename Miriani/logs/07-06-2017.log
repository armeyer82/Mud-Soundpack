00:07 Emily McManomy has wandered away from your group.

00:07 You peer out and see...

00:07 [Pax; Neutral Docking Bay]
This spacious docking bay looks remarkably similar to other docking bays, with the exception of its cleanliness. Aside from the various starships docking and undocking, you occasionally catch a glimpse of a sanitation drone darting between docked ships, quickly and quietly cleaning the area. Two massive archways lead to long, dull corridors.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the three-person heliogaster "Ozymandius" and the one-person expediter "Dragon Heart" landed here.
You see Eras the droid, a gleaming black security drone, a gleaming blue security drone, a transparent gray security drone, Pew the droid, Lloyd the droid, Whine the droid, Watcher the droid, Gabriel the droid, Bongo the droid, Silk the droid, Nadiyah the droid, Lillie the droid, and Blow the droid here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and up.

00:35 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:35 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

00:35 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

00:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:35 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."
(Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has undocked from Pax (Neutral Docking Station).

00:35 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:35 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:35 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:35 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:35 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

00:35 The ship must be in space to do that.

00:35 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

00:35 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:35 The computer announces, "It is currently 5:35 p.m. Galactic Standard Time. The date is Wednesday July 5, 2363."

00:35 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:35 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:35 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

00:36 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:36 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The eight-person gunship "Passionate Blaze" has jumped into the sector.

00:36 The eight-person gunship "Passionate Blaze" has jumped into the sector.

00:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

00:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:36 You put a droid remote titled "Empanda" in a black leather briefcase.

00:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

00:36 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the planet Acrylon.

00:36 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:36 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

A dense ring of forest surrounds this large clearing, the grass of which has been flattened by the light starship traffic. Off to the southwest, a small clear pond ripples gently beneath the sky. Towering trees dot the area, their branches hanging low with reddish gold apples. To the north, a narrow break in the trees leads off to a shaded path. To the south, a wide trail indicates a primitive road. The only other sign of modernization is the tall tower of rock rising into the sky off to the east. An open archway leads into the structure.

00:46 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Butterfly Palace; Emily's Private Ship Hangar.

01:20 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:20 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:20 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The ten-person battlecruiser "Assailance" has launched from Acrylon.

01:20 The ten-person battlecruiser "Assailance" has launched from Acrylon.

01:20 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

01:20 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

01:20 The ship must be in space to do that.

01:20 The computer announces, "Two starships and two planets have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:20 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

01:20 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:20 The focused ship is no longer in the sector.

01:20 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

01:20 The ten-person battlecruiser "Assailance" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

01:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

01:20 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:20 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

01:20 You must stand up first.

The floor is gray cement, much the same as the walls, and the combination of the two aid in amplifying the voice of whoever is speaking. A large archway leads back out to the corridor.
You see a podium and a semi-circular section of wooden seats with gray cushions here.

02:01 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "Whether you feel you will represent your alliance or not, I would suggest studying any materials you might have at hand. Atmospheric combat, yes, but also talk to pilots who have participated in direct action inside of Praelor space before. Study up on your Praelor factions and classes using RAVEN. Now is the time to be as informed as possible about our enemies so that we can keep our allies safe."

02:01 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle asks, "Are there any other questions?"

02:01 Anton Navarro stands up.

02:01 Ray Ridgeway is now the speaker.

02:02 Ray Ridgeway asks, "I know little of the kritzn, and the threat that they represent. I do know, that they seem to interrupt ftl travel. Is there any other known information available, such as...via Raven?"

02:03 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "We have not given the RAVEN any information regarding the Kritzn. I am afraid that I cannot share any of our information with you in an unclassified meeting. I will be able to tell your representatives more on Friday."

02:04 [General Communication] Olivia Cantrell transmits, "If I would have known sooner I would have come. I woke too late."

02:05 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle asks, "When you take part in a military briefing. In showing up, let alone speaking, do you feel it appropriate to wear pajamas?"

02:07 Emily McManomy stands up.

02:07 Therman Donaldson stands up.

02:07 High Guard Captain Evelin Kantrelle says, "This is not a laughing matter. I hope to work extensively with many of you in the near future, and even hope that our cooperation can become less formal. However, I fought beside scores of soldiers who died last night. It is time for this appothy to end. it is time to show respect for those of us who fall in combat while defending our space, and our people."

02:18 You can't launch from here.

02:18 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:18 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

02:18 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

02:18 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:18 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 6, 10."

02:18 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:18 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:18 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:18 [General Communication] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "I'll take one of those spots, if still open?"

02:19 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:19 You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

02:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

02:19 [General Communication] Lili Shannon transmits, "Yes and two more now!"

02:19 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:19 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

02:19 You peer out and see...
[Butterfly Palace; Emily's Private Ship Hangar]
In this room you can spot menny ship platforms where ships are safely put when transported from the landing pad, and hear the clanking of the robotic arms moving the ships from the garage back up to the landing pad.

A dense ring of forest surrounds this large clearing, the grass of which has been flattened by the light starship traffic. Off to the southwest, a small clear pond ripples gently beneath the sky. Towering trees dot the area, their branches hanging low with reddish gold apples. To the north, a narrow break in the trees leads off to a shaded path. To the south, a wide trail indicates a primitive road. The only other sign of modernization is the tall tower of rock rising into the sky off to the east. An open archway leads into the structure.

04:06 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Butterfly Palace; Emily's Private Ship Hangar.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You see Emily McManomy here.

A dense ring of forest surrounds this large clearing, the grass of which has been flattened by the light starship traffic. Off to the southwest, a small clear pond ripples gently beneath the sky. Towering trees dot the area, their branches hanging low with reddish gold apples. To the north, a narrow break in the trees leads off to a shaded path.

Hello everyone,
For those of you who were unable to attend, we recently were called to a meeting by a High Guard captain. We were informed that a massive assault on a HG crew, caused perimeter defences around 36 to crumble, leaving many HG pilots either dead or incapacitated and leading to a massive invasion of the sector. High Guard has approached us for help. They require two representatives from each alliance to join them in Praelor space for a counterstrike. They are requesting skilled pilots in ground, atmospheric, and air combat and would like us to have our votes cast and representatives picked by tomorrow at 7PM. We simply ask you to cast your votes and consider the task ahead, not your personal feelings for any one pilot.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

11:50 ["Hellion" Control Room] (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.

12:27 Fawkes Fogwell (C) (Male) is awake!

12:27 You remove a droid remote titled "acrylon" from a black leather briefcase.

12:27 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:27 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:27 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

12:27 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

12:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:28 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Acrylon.

12:28 The starship is already moving.

12:28 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:28 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Capricorn.

12:28 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

12:28 [Private | Miriam Valleris] Miriam Valleris transmits, "Am glad to hear that too."

12:28 You begin the landing sequence.

12:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

12:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

12:29 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Capricorn.

12:29 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:29 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

12:29 You peer out and see...
[Butterfly Palace; Emily's Private Ship Hangar]
In this room you can spot menny ship platforms where ships are safely put when transported from the landing pad, and hear the clanking of the robotic arms moving the ships from the garage back up to the landing pad. You see a colorful tapestry depicting a busy farm with a cluster of cows in the distance, a small flat disc containing the image of Paul, Anahra, Carl, Tim, Jordy, and Kelsey, a small flat disc containing the image of Kelsey Summers, a small flat disc containing the image of Emily Johnson, a small flat disc containing the image of Monica Lancaster, a small flat disc containing the image of Emily Mcmanomy, a small flat disc containing the image of Steven and Emily, and a small painting in a diamond frame hanging on the wall.
You see the eight-person gunship "From Out of The Shadows" and the one-person expediter "Dragon Wings" powered down here.
You see a suede sofa, a black leather recliner with rubies in the arms, a blue marble end table, an antique coffee table, a large marble fireplace with a mosaic tile hearth and a mosaic tile mantel, an antique white marble statuette of a butterfly with pearl tipped wings, a german shepherd, a hovering quadruple stroller with baby pink padded seats, Decoda Mcmanomy, Noah McManomy, Ashley the droid, Edward the droid, a nanny bot, Lexi McManomy, a painting of an angel playing a harp, Angel Mcmanomy, Braydon Mcmanomy, Alexander

You see Steven McManomy (lying on a suede sofa) here, sleeping.
You can go west.

12:30 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

12:30 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

14:04 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "Ah, ok. Yeah, I'm not doing much at the moment either."

14:04 You peer out and see...

14:04 [Capricorn; Lush Clearing]
A dense ring of forest surrounds this large clearing, the grass of which has been flattened by the light starship traffic. Off to the southwest, a small clear pond ripples gently beneath the sky. Towering trees dot the area, their branches hanging low with reddish gold apples. To the north, a narrow break in the trees leads off to a shaded path. To the south, a wide trail indicates a primitive road. The only other sign of modernization is the tall tower of rock rising into the sky off to the east. An open archway leads into the structure.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see Bella the droid, Annabell the droid, Cap the droid, and Bang the droid here.

14:05 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

14:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

14:05 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the planet Acrylon.

14:05 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:05 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

14:23 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.

14:24 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

14:24 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

14:24 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

14:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:24 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Acrylon.

14:24 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:24 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

14:24 This ship has no docking bays.

14:24 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:24 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

14:24 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

14:24 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

14:24 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:24 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

14:24 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:24 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:24 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:24 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20). You may also specify a destination name.

The walls of the room each represent a different alliance: The northern wall is dominated by a large logo for the Hale Collective, the eastern wall a logo for the Commonwealth of Free Spirits, and the western wall a logo for the Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists. The southern and outer wall displays three rings: indigo for AIE, cyan for Commonwealth, and gray for Hale, all connected to each other at the bottom with a single golden ring which represents the Alliance High Guard. A number of desks line the walls, providing information and services to people who seek it.

14:35 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

14:53 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

14:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sting Ray, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:53 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has launched from Rolukssica.

14:53 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:54 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

14:54 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

14:54 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:54 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

14:54 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

14:54 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

14:54 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has initiated an intrasector slip.

14:54 You don't see that here.

14:54 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:54 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

14:54 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

14:54 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

14:55 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

14:55 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

14:55 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

14:55 I don't understand that.

14:55 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

14:55 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:18 There are no damaged components.

15:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sting Ray, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has launched from Rolukssica.

15:19 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:19 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

15:19 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:19 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:19 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

15:19 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

15:19 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

15:19 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has initiated an intrasector slip.

15:19 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:19 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:19 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

15:19 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:19 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:19 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:20 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

15:20 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

15:20 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:20 You press a large yellow button.

15:20 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

15:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sting Ray, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:36 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has launched from Rolukssica.

15:36 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

15:36 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:36 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:36 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:36 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Sting Ray" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

15:36 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:36 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:37 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:37 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:22 ["Sting Ray" Control Room]
This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You can go down and out.

16:22 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

This lavishly decorated store is probably the brightest and cheeriest on the level. Helpful salesdroids roll about from place to place, greeting new customers as they enter and wishing them a good day as they leave. Large pedistals take up most of the available floorspace, each with a scale model starship perched atop. Embedded into each of the pedistals is a computer with information on the ship classes scrolling on it. Beneath each computer is a series of buttons, each clearly labeled as to their function. The button furthest to the left reads MENU, next to it is INFO, POINTS comes next, and last is BUY. A small machine in one corner of the shop proclaims that it manipulates keys. Three buttons are on the front of this machine beneath a narrow slot. Under the buttons is a much larger slot. The buttons read MAKE, DUPLICATE and INVALIDATE. To either side of the doorway are a pair of guards that appear to be deep in conversation about various pros and cons of each starship class. An ornate archway leads to another room, and hung above it is a sign with bold lettering proclaiming it to be a starship registry.

You see Emily McManomy (staring into space) here.
You can go south and out.

16:46 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

16:46 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

16:46 You begin the launch sequence.

16:46 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

16:46 The computer announces, "A starship and five planets have been detected in the sector."
The one-person shuttle "Acrylon Courier Transport 1136" has exited from Jumpgate to Central Jumpgate Hub.

16:47 The ship is already moving.

16:47 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:47 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:47 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:47 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

16:47 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:47 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

16:47 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:47 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

16:47 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:47 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:47 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:47 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.
The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

16:47 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

16:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

16:47 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

16:47 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.
You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

16:47 For a top, you are wearing a celestial blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, and a black stun armor storage bag.

16:47 You are carrying a stun turret in your left hand and a droid remote titled "Rolukssica" in your right hand.

16:56 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

19:22 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

20:01 Emily McManomy says, "the mission"

20:01 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

20:01 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
Emily McManomy says, "lol"

20:01 You can't launch from here.

20:01 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

20:01 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

20:01 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

20:01 You begin the launch sequence.

20:01 Emily McManomy says, "i don't fly bad"

20:01 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

20:01 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

20:01 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "Emily"

20:01 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:01 You say, "I need to practice flying."

20:01 Emily McManomy says, "ok"

20:01 [Private | Miriam Valleris] Miriam Valleris transmits through a fit of giggles, "Ah, as if I knew it."
#$#soundpack social | giggle | female

20:01 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:01 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:01 [Private | Miriam Valleris] Miriam Valleris transmits, "landing"

20:01 Emily McManomy gives you a massive hug.

20:01 #$#soundpack social | hug | female

20:01 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

20:01 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:01 Emily McManomy stands up.

20:01 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

20:01 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:02 Via general sector communication, Galactic Rainbow transmits greetings.

20:02 Emily McManomy pulls you to your feet.

20:02 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

20:02 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:02 The three-person heliogaster "Galactic Rainbow" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

20:02 This ship transmits, "1"

20:02 Emily McManomy speaks into a small microphone.

20:02 This ship transmits, "raaaaaaaaaaaaaaainbow"
The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:02 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:02 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:02 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

20:02 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

20:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

20:02 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

20:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

20:02 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

20:02 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

20:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fatal Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:18 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

20:18 You grin.

20:18 #$#soundpack social | grin | male

20:18 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:18 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

20:18 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:18 You ask Miriam Valleris, "You ready?"

20:18 Miriam Valleris nods.

20:18 Miriam Valleris smiles.

20:18 You grin.

20:19 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:19 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

20:19 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

20:19 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

20:19 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:19 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

20:19 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

20:19 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

20:19 Miriam Valleris sashays up.

20:19 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

20:19 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

20:19 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.
The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:19 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:38 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

20:38 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:38 The starship is already moving.

20:38 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

20:38 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

20:38 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

20:38 The ship needs to be in space to move.

20:38 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

20:38 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

20:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Rolukssica.

20:38 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:38 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

20:38 You grin.

20:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.
You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

20:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

20:44 Emily McManomy pushes a small lever away from herself, activating the ship's systems.

20:44 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

20:44 You notice Emily McManomy using the radio to request launch clearance.

20:44 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

21:02 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Butterfly Palace; Emily's Private Ship Hangar.

22:25 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862", the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243", and the one-person expediter "Black Lotus" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" and the eight-person gunship "Passionate Blaze" landed here.
