01:44 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Mercury; Surface Landing Site.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a blue trash can, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a smiling nanny, and a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars here.
You can go south.

01:44 You peer out and see...

01:44 [Mercury; Surface Landing Site]
Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the three-person freighter "Blue Moon" landed here.
You see a sparking airlock, Yawn the droid, Mer the droid, Alphy the droid, Lose the droid, and Miracle the droid here.

02:04 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a blue trash can, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a smiling nanny, and a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars here.

02:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Jellyfish, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:09 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Jellyfish" has launched from Rolukssica.

02:09 You will now be able to use non-numeric manual navigation commands. Please see HELP ALTERNATIVE MANUAL NAVIGATION for information about potential pitfalls.

02:09 The starship is already moving.

02:09 The starship is already moving.

02:09 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:09 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

02:09 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:10 #$#soundpack_pong

02:10 #$#soundpack_lag 109

02:10 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:10 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:10 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:10 The starship is already moving.

02:10 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:10 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Jellyfish" has initiated an intrasector slip.

02:10 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:10 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:10 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Jellyfish" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

02:10 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:10 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:10 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:10 You put a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in a sleek black leather carrying case.

02:10 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:10 You press a large yellow button.

02:10 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from red to yellow.
You hear the gentle hum begin to fade as the weapons power down.

02:10 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

02:10 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:23 ["Tempting Fate" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

02:23 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:23 You peer northwest and see...

02:23 ["Tempting Fate" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

02:24 ["Tempting Fate" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

02:24 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "That was a fast mission"

02:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

02:24 You hear several loud thuds as cargo is transferred from the ship.

02:25 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:25 Kevin Seiden's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ims slap you!"

02:25 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:25 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:25 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

02:25 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:25 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:25 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:25 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:25 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:41 You peer northwest and see...

02:41 ["Tempting Fate" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a comfortable black leather engineer's chair, and a flappy duck on wheels here.
You see Michael Calaway here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

02:41 ["Tempting Fate" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here.

02:59 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the eight-person gunship "Insurrection", the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion", the one-person Hale runabout "Death-Strike", the three-person freighter "Ruffabit", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Animallity" landed here.

03:04 Bob Smith's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "that one is open"

03:04 You peer northwest and see...

03:04 ["Tempting Fate" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a comfortable black leather engineer's chair, and a flappy duck on wheels here.
You see Michael Calaway here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

03:04 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

03:04 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

03:04 #$#soundpack environment starship space | powered | safe | light | indoors

03:04 ["Tempting Fate" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a comfortable black leather combat chair here.
You can go northwest.

03:04 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

03:04 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

03:04 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

03:04 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

03:04 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

03:04 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

03:04 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

03:04 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

03:04 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

03:04 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:04 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

Done.

03:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Jellyfish, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

03:40 [Chatter] Johanna Sanders transmits, "Pretty much."

03:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

03:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

03:40 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

03:40 [Chatter] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Wait, thought you were married and all that."

03:40 [Chatter] Pippa Lancaster transmits, "Sorry, break-ups suck."

03:40 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

03:41 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

03:41 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

03:41 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

03:41 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

03:41 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

03:41 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

03:41 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

03:41 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

03:41 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

03:41 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

03:41 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:54 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:54 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:54 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

12:54 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:55 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:55 #$#soundpack_lag 102

12:55 You're already sitting down.

12:55 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:55 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:55 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:55 The computer announces, "Four planets and three space stations have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:55 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 11, 7, 6."

12:55 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:55 Sector 1: Satus (Alliance of Interstellar Expansionists)

12:55 Galactic Coordinates: (-603080, 1, 420)

12:55 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:55 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:55 You hear a mechanical whine as the ship's solar panels orient themselves toward a star.

12:55 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:55 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:57 You peer out and see...

12:57 [Mercury; Surface Landing Site]
Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a sparking airlock, Yawn the droid, Mer the droid, Alphy the droid, Lose the droid, and Miracle the droid here.
You can go down.

12:57 You should stand up first.

12:57 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

You can go enter and out.

12:57 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

12:57 The computer flashes a message next to the airlock cycle button saying, "Beginning cycling."

12:57 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. The faint hiss of air can be heard exiting the airlock.

12:58 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

Done.

16:55 You have 450,702,451.05 credits.

16:55 I don't understand that.

16:55 You press a large button embossed with the stylized image of a mailbox.

16:55 The computer informs you that you have no mail waiting.

16:55 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:55 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

16:56 #$#soundpack_pong

16:56 #$#soundpack_lag 112

16:56 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:56 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:56 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:56 The ship is already moving.

16:56 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:56 The ship must be in space to do that.

16:56 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

16:56 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:56 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:56 Current coordinates: 13, 19, 15

16:56 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:56 The one-person cargo transport "Miriani Interplanetary Delivery 927" has landed on the planet Miriani.

16:56 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

16:56 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:56 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

16:56 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:56 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

16:56 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:56 The starship is in manual navigation mode.

16:56 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

16:56 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

16:56 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:56 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:56 You make a selection on a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

16:56 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]
Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kitty" reports current location pinpointed at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon.

16:56 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:56 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:56 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

16:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

16:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:57 #$#soundpack_pong

16:57 #$#soundpack_lag 106

16:57 You can't power down the starship in space.

16:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:57 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

16:57 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

16:57 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

16:57 You should stand up first.

16:57 Are you sure you wish to boot Tibo Beauchene? [Enter "yes" or "no"]

16:57 Tibo Beauchene has been booted.

16:57 A security drone appears and drags you off the ship.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

21:11 For a top, you are wearing a navy blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, an antique gold wedding band engraved with intertwining hearts, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, a red spacesuit navigational computer, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a softly padded black snuggly, a soft white cloth diaper bag patterned with dolphins, a black stun armor storage bag, and a level six archaeological dig site scanner.

21:11 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "So, do you want Ashley back?"

21:11 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

21:11 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

21:11 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

21:11 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

21:11 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:11 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

21:11 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:12 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:12 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

21:12 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:12 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:12 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:12 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

21:12 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:12 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:12 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:12 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

21:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

21:49 ["Jellyfish" Control Room] (indoors)
This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You can go down and out.

22:08 ["Jellyfish" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

22:10 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the eight-person gunship "Insurrection", the ten-person battlecruiser "Swift Annihilation", the ten-person battlecruiser "Animallity", the three-person antagonizer "Vae Victis", and the one-person expediter "The Blazey Speeder" landed here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

22:59 Last ten announcements:
[01/05/18 - 10:00 a.m.] Announcement: Good morning, friends! Inconvenient news! We're going to need a bit of downtime to do some things and stuff. So ten minutes from now (10:10 AM CST on 1-5-18) the server will be shutdown. It should be back 10-30 minutes later, depending on how badly things go. If it's an hour or more, you know all hope is lost and panic is all we have left. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[01/18/18 - 7:54 p.m.] Announcement: The tattoo parlor on Surgyria is temporarily closed down due to a health department mandate. Hopefully, it will be reopening very shortly. We apologize for the inconvenience.
[03/13/18 - 11:30 p.m.] Announcement: It is with heavy hearts today that we would like to acknowledge the death of a scientific legend. The physicist Stephen Hawking has passed away today at age 76. Defying all expectations, he was one of the greatest intellectuals that tirelessly researched and discovered mysteries about the universe we live in today. We've lost an inspirational and brilliant mind. R.I.P. 1942-2018
[03/14/18 - 9:09 p.m.] Announcement: Ahem. If anyone you know has tried to create an account between March 9, 2018 and now, they should once again be able to create one without getting violently disconnected. Sorry about that!
[04/01/18 - 12:08 a.m.] Announcement: Happy Easter, and april Fools!
[04/01/18 - 12:13 a.m.] Announcement: The annual Easter egg hunt has commenced! You can retrieve an Easter
22:59  basket on Jump Hub Station. Fill it with eggs and, once Easter is over, the person who has collected the most eggs will win a fabulous prize. You can see the current rankings by typing @TOP-EGGS. Good luck!
[04/01/18 - 11:01 p.m.] Announcement: Easter / april Fools will be ending in roughly one hour. Get those eggs while they're hot!
[04/02/18 - 8:52 p.m.] Announcement: Easter eggs can now be opened. Credit rewards have been halved, and you will also find other things other than credits as well. Enjoy!
[04/24/18 - 7:07 p.m.] Announcement: There seems to be an excess  of blatantly out of character communication peppering the airwaves tonight. We encourage any new players to re-read POLICY 3: Roleplay. For the next 12 hours, rather than handing out OOC warnings, we will be disabling your ability to communicate on public IC channels to cut down on the severe amount of OOCness and immersion shattering goodness.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turr
23:09 et, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, and a smiling nanny here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

23:18 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:18 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:18 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:18 The computer announces, "A starship, four planets, and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:18 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:18 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 10, 9."

23:18 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:23 [Summit; Public Docking Bay]
This spotless docking bay is large and features a sophisticated retractable roof. The walls are comprised of solid glass and give a dazzling view of the sector beyond. The roof is designed to retract into the walls and supporting brackets when a ship is coming in to dock, and will expand and seal itself in a matter of seconds. Illumination is provided by carefully placed lights along the outer-most portion of the ceiling and floor. One unique feature of the lighting system is the lights dimming as a starship is coming in to dock and when the ceiling retracts into the walls. Several cleaning drones whiz about, tidying things up as they move.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Palace of Shadow" and the four-person roborant "Bravitzlana Rubakalva" landed here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

Moments later, a flurry of frozen water crystals begins to drift down from vents in the ceiling, lazily swirling through currents of air being pumped out until it settles on the deck plating, where it immediately melts into a hazardous water puddle.

23:39 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Retribution", the five-person transverser "Defying Gravity", the three-person voyager "Explorer Two", the three-person freighter "Jordan", and the three-person freighter "Ruffabit" landed here.

23:56 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:56 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

23:57 #$#soundpack_pong

23:57 #$#soundpack_lag 104

23:57 The ship is already moving.

23:57 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:57 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:57 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:57 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:57 The computer announces, "A starship, two planets, and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:57 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:57 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:57 Current coordinates: 12, 16, 19

23:57 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

23:57 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)
Planets: (4, 4, 7)
Moons: (5, 3, 7)
Space Stations: (15, 6, 4), (10, 14, 9), (9, 13, 9), (10, 13, 9), (11, 13, 9), and (10, 12, 9)
Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Starships: Miriani Interplanetary Delivery 4997 [C] (4, 5, 8)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)
Current Coordinates: (12, 16, 19)

23:57 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:57 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:57 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

23:57 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:57 Select a ship:

23:57 [1] the one-person junker "Miriani Interplanetary Delivery 4997"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

23:57 Invalid selection.

23:57 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

23:57 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:57 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

23:57 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

23:57 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:57 Current coordinates: 12, 16, 20

23:57 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:57 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:57 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

23:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

23:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:57 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:57 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
