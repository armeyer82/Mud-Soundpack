Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin,
a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, a high tech
silver star print holovid, an insulated blue cooler, a robotic chef named
Nellie, a red plastic food storage container, Purr the humanoid service robot,
and Jewel the large violet glowing felo here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

Mischief the large black felo kitten hums melodically to itself as it wanders in
from the south.
Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."
'ok
You say, "Ok."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

early warning space defense device, a personal hoverpallet, a glossy seashell
pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a small mystic purple bioplastic crate, and Shasta
the big onyx soldier felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.

Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.

Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "It's annoying that someone had to whine
aobut their being a 5 mil toll rather than 7."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
'Yeah, I know.
You say, "Yeah, I know."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
Km}X^jiBiA<\+@Pz+xJh\498.91EWG*9Gr~VJZ(1
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, welcome to Belt of Orion. As you travel to the bubble or one of the
asteroid stations, fly safe, keep an eye on your charge and make sure to have
enough EAOS credits for the tolls. Have a nice day!"
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and
pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush
pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of
arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length,
straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a dark pink lace bullet bra, a pair of soft dark pink silk
bikini panties, and a pair of baby blue leather clogs with a row of multicolored
daisies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten
on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a
Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes,
neck, both shoulders, back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms,
both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, both thighs, both knees, both calves,

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Anyway, that the technology was
transferred to make the Lowell prior to the Outsiders revealing themselves and
the war starting against the IFS is a pretty good argument against your point
that the biggest advances happen during conflict. Hrak's trip happened during

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Tolls suck we should be rid of
them forever why do we have tolls make them go away I hate tolls why are you
making me pay to use your beacon this is not a very polite thing to do all
beacons should be free and while we're at it let's make all ships and ship
upgrades free let's just make credits for the sake of accumulating credits
because we all need credits to pay for nothing at all hey is this thing on can
anyone hear me."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There. Complaint
re-registered."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "No I just don't like that the

is that the orgs really don't make much at all so I think charging 20 mil for a

[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "On the contrary!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The orgs make plenty enough
from salvage/xeno/asteroids."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "The tolls pay for the parts
used to build the accelerator."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The accelerators are really
expensive."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If you want to provide the
accelerators, feel free!"
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "You would think so but 67k per
toll isn't going to pay for an accelerator."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "It adds up."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Huh."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I figured that vassalized
organizations contribute to all of that too, though."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "We've gotten like three tolls so 60 mil
was collected somewheres and orgs may have gotten a mil divided up amongst
them?"
Lily Kaise laughs.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The splits aren't even anyway.
Cats gets a much larger share of each toll."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I assume it's because we're
contributing the most expensive parts."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Ohhh that's neat."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "And good!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah it should go that way."

'I don't.
You say, "I don't."
'sorry
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Approximately?"
You say, "Sorry."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's more likely the fact that
you actually qualify for the accelerator pointwise, and the other organizations
are contributing megacredits to it, but proabbly qualify only for lower-level
accelerators."
Lily Kaise nods.
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Or none."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Whatever the reason, enough of
the toll ends up going to Cats to pay for the parts."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Just shut up Keegan. You are the first
to complain about not getting your share of something."
Lily Kaise laughs.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's more than likely what I
suggested. I imagine the accelerators work in the same tier-method as the
salvage processors. You get paid based on what you technically qualify for no
matter which one the station has built."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well it's good to know that there
is a sliding scale so to speak because it didn't seem equitable."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, unless you qualify for a
higher-level one and a lower-level one is put onto the station."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then you lose out."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "They're also missing my point too. I
don't really care if we get anything as we earn all kinds of credits it's jsut I
couldn't figure out why the proceeds would be that low but if the other orgs are
collecting more it's ok. Seriously though, orgs make so much money off of temp
stations. It's laughable when they complain about paying 10 megacredits for 10
stations when they rake in 2 to 4 megacredits per pop when they are applied.
Then the credits they rake in from salvaging, xenology and for the BAS."

support it. Ifever I get one, we'd still be fine."

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

ftl second battle
Once the frontier of Known Space for many years, the Borderlands region is now a
settled area of space, though rather poor compared to most others. A handful of
beacons indicate the positions of clouds of debris, but a nearby star indicates
a solar system may also be in this cluster.
A beacon has been placed trailing the orbit of Candelaria, a waypoint on the way
to and from deeper space.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Mine are in a-19 and
in 1-36."
This beacon lies along the path of the local solar system's galactic orbit. Dust
and debris has been pulled in its wake, leaving a funnel-shaped void.
Suddenly your ship is in the midst of a cloud of debris. Clearly these are the
remnants of a great battle, having long since drifted away from where it
originally took place.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-105 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Kalliste.' Welcome to The Second Battle of Deep Candelaria
Orbit."
