The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

I thought it would be cool to add a funding type of option on the apartment menu. This way you could put credits into this building account for what you want to save for building only. Just think it would be kind of cool for having another feature for saving credits. I know you can just put cash in a funding account, and that even being said, maybe have it where you can access funding through the building menu as well. Either way this was just a thought. If some are like me, i like to go by savings and so on for different projects. Sort of like my way to balance the books lol.

Might it be possible to be able to view the tradesman menu with @crequest or some other such conand, even if you can't purchase the item?
This will give people an idea if they should get a tradesman cert or the ability to keep an eye on an item if they so wish.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

Crew NPCs
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Crew NPCs are automated characters that can perform certain operations aboard a starship. Currently they only appear in starship simulators, but this may change at a later date. To give them orders, one must use the starship's intercom, accessible with the PA-command. An attempt has been made to make commands as natural as possible as to not spawn confusion. Take heed that while this system is new, there may be bugs or oversights in NPC responses. Please REPORT these as they make themselves known to facilitate fixing them. Furthermore, this help file may be in flux as we add (or remove) compatible commands.
  Combative NPCs
Combative NPCs are non-player characters that can operate a starship's weapons. They can be given sets of coordinates and ship titles, ship numbers as indicated by the FOCUS-command, or simply told to shoot at the closest vessel.
Commands
RANGE (or GO) - Notify all crew aboard to begin firing upon the currently focused ship. This used to be the closest ship. May not actually be necessary as the crew will begin firing automatically when the ship moves within range of the focused ship.
FOCUS <ship name> - Focus all attacks on <ship>. If there is no ship present in the sector with such a name, nothing will happen.
<coordinates> - Instruct all crew aboard to fire at <coordinates>. Coordinates can be a comma-delineated list or
17:31  simple numbers. (Example: 3, 3, 3.)
SHIP <number> - Instruct all crew aboard to target <ship>. The number provided should be the number that corresponds to the FOCUS menu.
STOP (or ENOUGH, STAND DOWN, KNOCK IT OFF, HOLD YOUR FIRE, SEASE FIRE) - Instruct the crew to stop focusing on the currently focused ship.
Notes
If an NPC is stationed in a weapon room containing varying types of weapons, it will traditionally pick the most effective one. For example, if there are four laser turrets and one cannon, it is likely that laser turrets would be preferred over bardenium cannons since the combined damage is greater.
   Engineering NPCs
These NPCs will act as an engineer. They will repair based on priority, abort repairs when more important damages arise, and announce warnings when critical components are damaged.
Commands
REPAIR (or REP) <component> - Your engineer will stop any ongoing repairs immediately and switch to the requested component, provided that the component isn't destroyed or undamaged. (Example: repair turret 1.)
START REPAIRING THE HULL AT <percent> (or just REPAIR THE HULL AT) - Notify your engineer that they should start repairing the hull when it reaches <percent>. Note that if desired, you can simply use a number without the percent (%) symbol. Furthermore, the NPC will begin issuing warnings via the intercom when the hull breaches this percentage. (Example: Start repairing the hull at 60%.)
WHEN AR
17:31 E YOU REPAIRING THE HULL - In case you forget when you told your NPC to commence repairs on the hull, this is the command.
WHAT ARE YOU REPAIRING - Self-explanatory. The engineer will announce over the intercom what he or she is repairing, along with an estimated timeframe until the repair's completion.
STOP REPAIRING - Instruct your engineer to stop an ongoing repair. Your engineer will not repair anything until he or she is told to repair something else. After that, they will assume they should begin working again.
Notes
Engineering NPCs will categorize components based on priority and damage. Conclusions of whether a component is important enough to repair at the time or not are often correct, but in the cases that it seems your engineer is repairing something that it shouldn't be, please report it using the REPORT-command.
  Conclusions
Crew NPCs are yet another way to sharpen one's combat prowess and learn the intricacies of commanding a starship crew. Like players themselves, they befall the same restrictions of roundtime and delays; do not expect them to be facsimiles of perfection. Enjoy commanding your crew!

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see
17:33  a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

20:35 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator
22:10 , three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator
