Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
(60 seconds roundtime.)
Faint sounds and sensations tickle you to consciousness, as if they were coming
from very far away. A gurgle, followed by sudden dizziness.
[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Cryosuspension; Fore]
You see a painting framed in gold gilt of a solitary sugar maple on a snowy
hill, a row of cryosuspension tubes containing Rogue Romano beating at the hatch
of the tube, Keegan Wantz clutching at his throat, and Luja Garland staring with
eyes wide and mouth wide open in a silent scream, a portable hot tub, a crudely
hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a black plastic tray of spider chow, Rogue
Romano's locker, Shule Elemmire's locker, Keegan Wantz's locker, Luja Garland's
locker, and Nekomata the medium-sized blue twin tailed felo here.
You can go north, south, and up.
You come to on the floor in a puddle of thick liquid, shivering violently, both
from cold and from the fading memory of utter terror. You struggle to rise, your
limbs shaking uncontrollably. You try to pull in breath and realize that you
cannot. Panic begins to rise.
Your throat spasms abruptly, and you spew a long stream of clear blue gel,
emptying your lungs. You cough raggedly, drawing in deep breaths, and strength
slowly begins to return to your body.

humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

Lily Kaise smiles at you.
Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Huh."
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Keeps thrusting hard and squeezing you affectionately, Shule cums deep inside

The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
Lily presses gently but firmly up against you as you cum.
Lily Kaise smiles at you.

Anfisa has charted course to aquarium station after travelling 2.04 light-trade
cycles from previous stop. Relative heading is southwest and very slightly down.
We resumed more direct heading of 215, -3 and have 109.04 light-trade cycles to
go to aquarium. Storm has pushed us enough that we are covering unexplored space
as we return.

A hairy black and yellow skull-patterned eight-legged ArachnoPal named Jolly
Roger skitters out.
Do you know what they want?
They stare at you. Of course they do.
So much pain. For what?
Why are you doing this?
There's someone behind you.
It comes for you.
You're really alone here. So very alone.
Remember what I said.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
You hear an extremely loud high frequency whine, barely within your range of
hearing.
You hear the faint noise of metal scraping against wood from somewhere deeper
within the house.
Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Aisling did you set
the code on this security container?"
Soraya Rhyz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think she's out. I
don't see her on the ship sensors."
You hear an ominous rattling noise from somewhere deeper within the house.
You think you see a pair of strikingly human eyes embedded in a nearby doorway.
They blink lazily at you. You quickly realize that they look identical to
Akemi's.
The rattling recedes into the distance.
The pair of strikingly Akemi-like eyes melt back into the door.
You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place
seems to go on forever.
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If someone falls asleep with a felo on a
leash, is there any way to move the felo? I thought at first the problem was
because the felo was asleep, but it didn't follow when the person was moved."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "And it's awake now."
The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
Listen. You need to be careful.
They talk about you when you are asleep, you know.
You're not imagining it. This is real.
You're not imagining it. This is real.
Remember what I said.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.
An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a
high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.
A hairy black and yellow skull-patterned eight-legged ArachnoPal named Jolly
Roger skitters into the area.
Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along
with yours.
A hairy black and yellow skull-patterned eight-legged ArachnoPal named Jolly

A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns
to place it on another conveyor belt.

Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.
The starship lurches as it falls through one part of the webbing into another.
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A swollen, dying, red star floats here, approximately the size of Earth's entire
orbit. Extraordinarily large flares arc lazily through space. It is possible
that a handful of planets still survive, unless they orbited near enough to be
absorbed by the expanding star.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Kim, maintain 215 but
level out entirely. 215 0 for now."
Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Tree planets?"

A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.
Klaus Stein's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Leaving in 30 seconds
unless there's any objections."
Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "3, 1 2 3."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

Travelled 7.17 LTC before reaching Planetary System 1100-5047. Found 3 planets,
grade 60-80 debris and luminosity was slightly less than sol-equivalent. Anfisa
noted our position as being 102.54 LTC from the aquarium. Now resumed on a

Prior to that planetary system, not long after Aisling went to bed, we heard the
whining sound that is one of the characteristics of a burning chain attack.
Rattling noises followed. The riftscape was the old house with many doors and
rooms, and a pair of eyes very similar to mine appeared in one of the doors.
Since such things typically happen just before a chain attacks, I decided to
take a different approach and challenged the being to emerge so that I could
beat it.
I threatened it with a vibro-baton, telling it that if it did not leave I would
hunt it and make it regret making an enemy of me. The whining noise grew
unimaginably loud from my perspective, but the other people present did not hear
it. I fell over from the noise disorienting me, and was deaf from tinnitus. The
rift entity retreated as soon as it was apparent that I meant to keep fighting
anyway. The ringing has subsided somewhat, but my hearing is still messed up.
I am fit to keep going, but when we get home I intend to get my hearing checked.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pansy silk night shirt. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a light purple flightbag with
a pastel kitten on the side, a compact metallic purple camera with a gold
fleur-de-lys embossed on the front with a glittery pink camera strap, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes,
neck, both wrists, both hands, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both
feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Living Quarters Six]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a compact red
refrigerator, a small seashell pink trash can, an insulated green cooler, a
small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated orange cooler, and a black plastic tray of
spider chow here.

A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing
beneath the ocean waves.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Destroyed alien starships and space stations fill space in this area. Unlike
similar sites, the damage appears to be rather one-sided, with most of the
debris consisting of non-military equipment that is nonetheless rather
battle-scorched.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
