Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a glossy
pale pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather
captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a
hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a
small white trash bin, a small blue insulated cooler, a compact red
refrigerator, a blue plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light
khaki canvas sneakers, a small red insulated cooler, a clear plastic food
storage container, Purr the humanoid service robot, an insulated purple cooler,
and Bert the hefty blue soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.
Lily says, "Some how we were a lot farther out than I had figured."
Lily says, "But we're back in Known Space so hopefully that's a sign that we'll

You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They
seem extremely loud. The signal strength meter reads: 92%.
'Well the Torus is 92 percent.
You say, "Well the Torus is 92 percent."
'And yeah, I saw we're back in known space.
"And yeah," you say, "I saw we're back in known space."
Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "I'm glad we have designations of space now which I
didn't see last year and also the percentages on the NDB."
Lily says, "Yep."

You nod to Lily.
"Known space going out was just for a few LTC so if we're near an alliance's
territories," says Lily, "then that will be very comforting."
Lily says, "It seems we had definitely drifted down a bit."
Bert the hefty blue soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Bert the hefty blue soldier felo.
Bert the hefty blue soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand,
looking up at her adoringly.

A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws
raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly
while dancing around it.
'Awww

'Yeah, hopefully we'll find a beacon or something soon.
"Yeah," you say, "hopefully we'll find a beacon or something soon."
"I don't have a backup for it," Lily says. "I sure had hoped it would
reproduce."
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
Lily says, "The dark gray and the white ones are the most difficult and rare for
me."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a glossy

You nod.
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches out.
The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.
A short yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "So silly question. I have this
stationary artifact repository drone thing. How exactly does this thing work?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Put a xenology container into it, drop an
artifact in the vicinity, and watch what happens!"
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "You just drop the artifacts and it picks
it up and stores it."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Aha."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Can't empty your xeno bag into it
though?"
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na. You have to put the container in
there."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Just put the whole thing in. THAT'S
WHAT SHE SAID HA HA."
[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That way, when you're done collecting
artifacts, you can just take it out of there and do what you have to do."
[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Got it."
The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the
creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.
caress lily on back
You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.
"I'll stop and check for a beacon," Lily says.
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily sighs.
rift loc
The starship is not in the riftflow.
Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
'Awww
You say, "Awww."
'We'll get home somehow.
You say, "We'll get home somehow."
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
"I came East 1 LTC and wanted to go back that way but the flow has been west and
slightly up for hours," Lily says.
nod
You nod.
A medium-sized semi-transparent cylindrical creature with long dangling tendrils
and a chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.
"I know going down seems to take us out of range of the NDB," Lily says. "I'm
not sure if we should go farther up or which way. If you have any suggestions, I
would certainly appreciate them."
A medium-sized semi-transparent cylindrical creature with long dangling tendrils
and a chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.

"Maybe see if someone could try broadcasting from the torus?" you ask.
A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws
grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives
up when it can't break the toy.
Lily says, "They can't hear us."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo rubs up against a dark purple leather
captain's chair, purring softly.
Purr the humanoid service robot clomps south.
"Also unless an org has time rented," says Lily, "they could only do that if
anorg will foot the bill."
Purr the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.
Purr the humanoid service robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food
over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red
aquatic life and coral rocks.
Purr the humanoid service robot clomps south.
A short yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment,
then jets off.
Purr the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.
"I'll certainly try asking on the QE but they've not said a word directly to us
so I'm not counting on it that they will," Lily says.
Lily Kaise presses a few buttons on a sleek metal quantum entanglement
communication device, sending a message.
A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps quietly,
indicating that it has begun sending a message.
Lily says, "Hope that makes sense."

Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns
to place it on another conveyor belt.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy

She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster.
Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
