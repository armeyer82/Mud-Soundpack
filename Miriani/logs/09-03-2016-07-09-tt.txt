-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt and Jewel the sleeping large violet glowing felo on it, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and green aquatic life and coral rocks, a small
yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small white trash
bin, a blue plastic food storage container, Desiree the little black and white
spotted CatBot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a clear plastic food storage
container, a small red insulated cooler, a compact red refrigerator, an engraved
silver metal box decorated with enameled amethyst butterflies, a round white
rattan coffee table with a glass top, a red plastic food storage container, an
insulated purple cooler, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.

Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I am almost afraid to say what I am
thinking."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We've traveled a little over 50 LTC.
After about 56 LTC, you could drop out and check to see if we are in range of
288 or 287."
Kim Saunders nods. "Ok."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I had asked Akemi to transmit or have
someone transmit on the hyperwave but haven't heard anything so we'll just wing
it."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "When did you ask her?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I wrote to her prior to departure."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Also another queue is when the
Extra-Long NDB is around 91 to drop out and see if anything is within fTL
range."
Kim Saunders asks in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, but she does not know which
day she can expect us home, so how should she know when we want her to transmit
something?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Um Kim I'm not an idiot ok? I told her
which days."
"If after another 5 or 6 ltc we are not in range of 287 or 288, should I change
heading or keep going?" Kim Saunders nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Stay on this heading."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Right."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Once we enter the Accelerator, it will
take us west and slightly down."
Kim Saunders nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "However going to 288 may take awhile as
we won't be hitting the exact vector for the accelerator most likely."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Or same for 287 depending upon which we
encounter first. If you see both, then take 287."
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a

Kim says to Lily Kaise, "Well, we traveled at least 2 or maybe even 3 ltc

also at distance."

traveled."

was 56 like you said, the extra long range was already at 87 or 88 then. I tried
the beacons, none in range, then I traveled another 2.1 ltc, and then another 1
and a half, then shule woke up and we were at 88 percent on the extra long
range, and at 61 percent on the standard and had been on that for some time."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "I need to know how many LTC we had
traveled though?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Within 5 minutes after shule made
the change the standard went up to 62 and a few minutes later the long range up
to 89."

but i'm more interested in knowing how many LTC we had traveled."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

[Newbie Help] Damien Goss transmits, "Not that I'm aware of. Though I suppose
you could ask the hosts for something like that as a donator item. Now that
you've given me the idea I might just do that, heh."
Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, yeah, usually. I'm just wondering
if I need to check to make sure there isn't a problem, but I figured they would

A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no
atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large
floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some
alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Lily Kaise turns a dial on the space imager to achieve proper focus, then
presses a large button.
