Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Good morning. First of all, let me begin
this report by welcoming Brent Farrell to the pilot corps. Then, I have the
state of the corps report as of June 9th 2317 which tells us the following. 10
days into the term, the AEU has completed 16 out of a total of 131 total decoy
beacon drops (12.21%). The AEU is also responsible for 0 out of 9 total
destroyed rats nests (0.0% and finally the AEU is responsible for 0 out of 0
total salvage ops. Further I would like to add that at the moment 5 AEU pilots
are out on an expedition, including our industrial whip, Space Defense Captain
and Ground squad leader. I have no info on our progress towards goals, but if
you need any help at all, with space or ground combat or general questions, feel
free to ask me or write me a letter and I will do my best to give you a hand.
That concludes my report for today. Have a nice day, and fly safe. Kim Saunders.

clarification."

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The two-person Accord gemini "Mischiefmaker Unchained", the imperator "Someday

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

the heavy fighter also."

Ather Jammoa says, "To be perfectly honest, I haven't found anything good about
either of those fighters that I can't get in a standard fighter, if you like
that sort of thing."
Ather Jammoa says, "Yes, one has a stronger hull, but that won't do shit for you
if you can't take it places without a mothership."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah and they draw meaner enemies too."
Constantine Stone says, "I did some double fighter beacons with Erik a while
back."

Ather says to Constantine, "Well, you don't yet qualify for better grids, but
the point is, in a heavy fighter, your grid will run out even faster."
Lily says to Constantine, "Have you worked on obtaining your basic engineering
tools?"

You glance at your communicator's screen.

Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, I finally got those."
Lily Kaise says, "Ok as the energy dumps do help with the grid and of course the
other tools are obvsiously useful."
Ather says to Constantine, "I would suggest sticking with the standard fighter.
A lot of people have actually done that. Heck, Nissi still uses a standard
fighter a lot for solo combat."
Lily Kaise says, "Wow."
Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, I should build a couple energy dumps, I
haven't done that yet."
Constantine says to Ather, "Ah, okay. I'll keep working in that then."
Ather Jammoa says, "Well, I mean, a fighter is worth less than shit in an attack
if you can't jump it to places without the high risk of losing the fucking
mothership."
Constantine Stone says, "This is true."
Constantine Stone asks, "What about the last battery listed in your book?"

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings pilots: as of this comm notice,
all AEU sectors are clear of all threats. I'm also glad to see that there were
minimal losses in the AEU fleet while we were out on the most recent expedition.
Notably, a cargo hauler by the name of "Fire comet". I say to that pilot as well
as others, if you need any help in flying, or have any questions about space
combat in general, feel free to call the SDC office, or send a letter to Ather,
and I will do my best to help you out. Finally, I know I promised that I would
hold space combat classes which would give additional information about the
threats that we tend to face, but the recent expeditions, plus a couple of other
things have kept me from doing it. In the meantime, if anyone has any questions
about how to fight off anything like pirates, IFS, Outsiders, thralls etc, feel
free to contact me and I'll do my best to answer them. You will receive a comm
notice when I have figured out a schedule for space combat classes, and there
will also be a board post. [21:05 22 June 2317 GST]
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.
Constantine Stone asks, "What about the Emerging Tech upgrade to the exploration
scout?"
Constantine Stone says, "Ather's book says it reduces battery life, so I haven't
done it."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "How many points I need to
get in on one of these?"

what is the point?"

Lily Kaise says, "When it became available, I tried it and I revertedit."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Star Conquest Help: Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying
--
Category: Activities
--
This help file describes various scientific tasks you can perform on points of
interest you find in deep space. Points of interest can be nearly anything --
asteroid clusters, nebulas, star systems, and more! You will find these objects
at intervals when exploring in deep space, and your first step is to simply
approach them and have your ship arrive within the area of interest. After that,
there are several things you can do, depending on your ship's equipment, to
study the object. The data you bring back home is likely to be very valuable!
IMAGING, SPECTROSCOPY, AND ANALYZING
Space imaging is described in detail in the Space Imaging help file.
Once your starship has space imaging equipment, it can be augmented with a
series of spectroscopes and scanners sold by Central Stellar Cartography at the
main location on The Torus. The command to begin using this equipment is
SPECTROSCOPE. Once started, the computer will iterate through all of the
analysis equipment it has available. If you wish, the scan can be aborted by
repeating the command. The data gathered will be stored in the ship's surveying
databanks -- more on this below!
PLANETARY SURVEYING
Certain points of interests will be planetary systems! Exoplanets are of
particular interest to scientists back home and are always an exciting find.
The first step, if your ship has the necessary planetary surveyor, is to use the
SURVEY command. This will begin a series of scans that will eventually locate
and plot the orbits of all planets in the system.
Once the planets are found, you can use the JUMP command to have your ship
perform a field triangulation and travel via wormhole to your newly discovered
planets! However, this is where your advancement of scientific understanding
ends... unless, of course, you also have probes aboard, as detailed in the next
section!
PROBES AND LANDERS
If you have enough points, you may purchase a probe launcher from Central
Stellar Cartography. It can then be loaded with probes at any CSC branch using
the usual MENU and BUY commands. If you find you have too many of a particular
type of probe, you can unload them for some of your money back using the SELL
command.
Probes are used to study points of interest as well as individual planets. Each
probe can be deployed using one of three programs: close approach, extended
observation, or lander. A close approach probe is simply fired directly at an
object and transmits telemetry for as long as it can, often right up until it
impacts. An extended observation probe orbits or holds station near an object
for at least several hours, gathering much more information. And a lander will
gather information about the surface of a planet.
You do not need to stay and wait for a probe to complete a lengthy observation.
If you return to the site at any time after a probe has completed its program,
it will transmit the data to your ship within a minute or so. Since both probes
and time are limited, it is a good idea to save them for particularly worthy
targets, like green planets or exotic objects.
DISCOVERER CREDIT
Discoverers are the first people to image, survey, scan, or probe a new point of
interest and will be accorded a certain special status forever. If you cannot
complete all possible tasks at a point of interest, then any future followup
work will still be credited to any qualifying discoverers, even if they are not
on the new crew.
Uncertain if you're the first one to visit an area, or which studies have
already been performed? Be sure to get the CSC's onboard library upgrade and use
the LIBRARY command!
DATABANKS
Images are physical hardcopies and planetary surveys are stored in the ship's
main databanks, but all other data is stored on special surveying databanks.
These databanks have a limited capacity depending on the type of ship, which can
be viewed with the DATABANKS command. This capacity can be extended with
upgrades.
CREDITS FOR DATA
Surveying data can be transferred to any Central Stellar Cartography branch
using the SUBMIT command. Crew members must individually submit their planets,
but only the ship's owner can submit the contents of its databanks. Once the
data is processed, each member will be mailed their reward and given the
appropriate points.

Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

[Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows,
abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, groin, both
thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Star Conquest Help: Large Starship Requirements
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Cruiser-class starships have a license point requirement like any other
starship. However, they also have certain other requirements, to help ensure
that these expensive warships end up only in the most capable hands.
To own a cruiser, you must first have 5,000 lock evasion points. Lock evasion
points are gained in the course of navigating in battle and avoiding being hit.
Note: If you are being credited with weapon hits, you will not be credited with
lock evasions. This is done in order to avoid doubling the rate of combat point
gain of pilots of smaller ships.
An aspiring cruiser owner is also required to complete eight qualifying beacon
drops as navigator. Qualifying beacon drops are at the high level or above, and
involve a single ship which is of a gunship class or larger. In addition, the
pilot in the control room must be alone and without assistance for the duration
of the beacon drop, and the beacon drop cannot be interrupted -- meaning the
ship cannot leave the sector before the beacon drop has been completed.
A pilot can work towards these requirements at any time, and a capable aspiring
cruiser owner is likely to meet them in the process of gaining the required
points.
You can check your qualifications at any time with the INFO command.
Existing cruisers require their owner to be qualified before they can launch. If
the cruiser is owned by an organization, at least one cruiser-qualified pilot
must be aboard.
