You see a cozy little bedroom with carpet floors and drywall walls. The walls are painted red. A glass rose with a soft orange light inside is casting a warm soft orange light throughout the room.
You see two large curved antique cherry bedside tables, an antique black wrought iron tiered candelabra holding four slender crimson taper candles, a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread, a large soft red and white heart shaped area rug, a large marble fireplace with a stone hearth and a cherrywood mantel, two overstuffed bright white suede recliners, a red heart-shaped air freshener, a small bamboo bassinet lined with ivory soft padding and covered with a sunshine yellow canopy, and a hologram of a flower garden projected in the middle of the room here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread) here, sleeping.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

14:17 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

14:17 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

14:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:17 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

14:17 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

14:18 The computer reports the six-person sentinel "Primordial Cyclone" is one unit away from this ship.

14:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

14:18 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:18 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

14:20 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:20 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

14:20 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

14:20 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

14:20 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

14:20 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

14:20 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

14:20 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

14:20 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

14:20 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

14:20 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Hi everyone."

14:20 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

14:20 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:20 Amore Carver's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "hi hi"

14:20 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:20 Jack West's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "how's it goin, tibo?"

14:20 You hear a high-pitched squeal as the starship emits a sustained long-range laser burst.

14:20 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:20 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "It's going well. Thanks."

14:20 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "How about you?"

14:29 ["Primordial Cyclone" Weapons Room 1] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft silver light throughout the room. You see a gunning informational poster hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

15:24 Last ten announcements:
[12/03/17 - 7:58 p.m.] Announcement: The elves would like to remind everybody to get their gift requests in as soon as possible to minimize the stress on us. You've got until the 18th at 11:59 PM GST for your request to be sent in. We would also like to remind everyone to use the tradesman labs on Empanda Station where possible. You may wish to read message board posts 88727 and 88748. Thanks again and happy holidays!
[12/08/17 - 8:24 p.m.] Announcement: Time for a reminder. Please, for the love of toast, when aboard a starship, please type PA-CHECK before taking it upon yourself to go out of character on the PA. Be considerate of other players. If they wish to remain in character, please respect their right to do so. OOC warnings will be handed out for violations. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
[12/15/17 - 12:16 p.m.] Announcement: This is a reminder that you have about two and a half days (check local listings) to submit a gift request to Santa if you haven't done already. If your gift request is rejected after the 18th, you will have until the 23rd for a second chance. Message board posts 88727 and 88748 for all the dirty details. Happy holidays!
[12/19/17 - 2:03 a.m.] Announcement: Combat Day is upon us once again! Go forth and eviscerate your friends for the enjoyment of everyone involved. You can type COMBATDAY to see your individual score, and, confusingly enough, @COMBATDAY to see everyone's current score. Typing COMBATDAY while out of comms will drag you kicking and screaming back in communications range for the violence. Happy birthday, Miriani!
[12/19/17 - 2:05 a.m.] Announcement: Oh, and for every hour you don't fire a weapon, you'll lose a Combat Day point. Exciting, I know.
[12/20/17 - 10:31 p.m.] Announcement: Cutoffs for submitting a gift request to Santa are in about an hour and a half. So if you haven't yet asked for a gift, please do so as soon as possible. If you have had your gift request rejected within the past two days, you have until midnight on the 23rd to submit your second chance request. Thank you and merry Christmas!
[12/23/17 - 4:39 p.m.] Announcement: Final call for second chance Christmas gift requests, folks! As of midnight GST tonight, December 23, we will no longer be taking requests. So if you've had a letter rejected over the last few days, now is the time to resubmit. Merry Christmas!
[12/24/17 - 11:00 p.m.] Announcement: Merry Christmas to everyone in the Eastern time zone!
[12/25/17 - 8:28 p.m.] Announcement: We apologize for the lack of Christmas festivities this year. We have all been extremely busy and haven't had much time to plan anything out. Anyone who requested a gift from Santa should now have it in the mail, or if out of communications range, in hand or on the ground next to you. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!
[12/27/17 - 11:29 a.m.] Announcement: A face
15:24  shape option has just been added to character generation! To adopt this new appearance option, you should use the novelly named NEWAPPEARANCE command. Keep an eye on the announcements for more appearance updates.

15:26 ["Seaturtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 251270; Starship Parking Facility.
You see a black suede sofa, a cherry wood coffee table, and an internal stun turret here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a black suede sofa) here, sleeping.
You can go south, up, and out.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer.

Upgrades: Subwarp Drive, Slip Drive, and Advanced Obstacle Detection Sensors
Additional Information: The four-person surveyor is the beginning starship for any AIE explorer. The
ship boasts an advanced sensory system which allows for the early detection and,
consequently, avoidance of large obstacles that might catch any other starship
by surprise in uncharted space. In addition, it comes standard with ten days of
charge, a subwarp drive, a slip drive, and ample storage space. The only area
this starship lacks is weaponry, as it was designed for exploration rather than
combat.

16:35 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:35 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

16:35 You're already sitting down.

16:35 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

16:35 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:35 Miriam Valleris must be sitting up in a chair with a seatbelt to do that.

16:35 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:35 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:35 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:35 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

16:35 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:35 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

16:35 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:35 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:36 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:36 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:36 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

16:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

16:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:36 A red message board reader beeps quietly, indicating to you that there is a new message in General / Trading. It was posted by Tiberius Black with the subject "Re: looking for a fully upgraded gunship".

16:36 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

16:36 You should stand up first.

16:36 You stand up.

16:36 You can't go that way.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall 
18:08 oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

18:08 You begin transferring debris to the spaceport.

18:08 You hear several loud thuds as cargo is transferred from the ship.

18:08 A haunting screech drifts in from the storage room as something heavy is dragged across the floor.

You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a light blue dragon-shaped garden fountain, an extra large thick green and blue rectangular outdoor rug, a sturdy blue baby walker with a butterfly print padded seat and an assortment of toys on the attached plastic tray, a shimmering red metal horse carriage with gold wheels, a hovering sapphire blue metal spaceship with silver wheels, a fierce jet black hovercycle with attached golden bells, an orange satin-lined umbrella double stroller patterned with lions, a red furniture trolley, a hovering quadruple stroller with light yellow padded seats, and a chrome silver hovercraft here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 251270; Starship Parking Facility.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You see Miriam Valleris (dozing) (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 251270; Starship Parking Facility.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starshi
20:56 p simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

20:57 You lean in toward Miriam Valleris and gently kiss her lips.
