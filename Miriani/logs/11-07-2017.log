A combination of long bright tubular blacklights and smaller round multicolored lights bathe the area in a mysteriously ethereal glow. The colorful lights change color along to the beat of the loud, lively music which pervades the surrounding vicinity. The floor is made of a gleaming snow white marble which appears to become incandescent under the influence of the blacklights. A long tall black granite bar dominates this portion of the club. A row of tall stools apolstered in supple dark leather stands before the bar and a live bartender is stationed behind it, mixing, pouring and serving a variety of beverages and foods. Guests can TALK to the bartender in order to see what types of things are offered for sale. Various bar games have been set up for guests to play, and a giant bucket of peanuts is also available for grazing.

A combination of long bright tubular blacklights and smaller round multicolored lights bathe the area in a mysteriously ethereal glow. The colorful lights change color along to the beat of the loud, lively music which pervades the surrounding vicinity. The floor is made of a gleaming snow white marble which appears to become incandescent under the influence of the blacklights. A long tall black granite bar dominates this portion of the club. A row of tall stools apolstered in supple dark leather stands before the bar and a live bartender is stationed behind it, mixing, pouring and serving a variety of beverages and foods. Guests can TALK to the bartender in order to see what types of things are offered for sale. Various bar games have been set up for guests to play, and a giant bucket of peanuts is also available for grazing.
You see a long polished black granite bar with tall butter soft leather apolstered stools, a large black metal trash receptacle draped in color changing lights, a giant barrel of peanuts, The Drinking Game, a digital hangman game mounted on the wall, a petite young bartender, a sanitation drone dressed in a fine black tuxedo, and an empty peanut shell here.

[Commoveo; Medraska's Nightclub; Bar] (indoors) (sitting at a long polished black granite bar with tall butter soft leather apolstered stools)
A combination of long bright tubular blacklights and smaller round multicolored lights bathe the area in a mysteriously ethereal glow. The colorful lights change color along to the beat of the loud, lively music which pervades the surrounding vicinity. The floor is made of a gleaming snow white marble which appears to become incandescent under the influence of the blacklights. A long tall black granite bar dominates this portion of the club. A row of tall stools apolstered in supple dark leather stands before the bar and a live bartender is stationed behind it, mixing, pouring and serving a variety of beverages and foods. Guests can TALK to the bartender in order to see what types of things are offered for sale. Various bar games have been set up for guests to play, and a giant bucket of peanuts is also available for grazing.
You see a long polished black granite bar with tall butter soft leather apolstered stools, a large black metal trash receptacle draped in color changing lights, a giant barrel of peanuts, The Drinking Game, a digital hangman game mounted on the wall, a petite young bartender, and an empty peanut shell here.
You see Matt Valentino, Kitty Mars (staring into space), and Aaliyah Morales (staring into space) sitting at a long polished black granite bar with tall bu

09:06 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

09:06 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

09:06 I don't understand that.

09:06 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

09:06 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

09:06 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

09:06 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

09:06 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

09:06 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

09:06 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

09:06 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

09:06 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

09:06 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

09:06 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

09:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

09:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

09:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

09:07 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

09:07 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

19:28 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Odessa; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.

This is a vast well lit lobby of gleaming white marble flooring and wide holographic windows. At it's center, a set of clear reinforced glass doors lead into an elevator. The elevator car itself is composed completely of glass and the shaft is itself a cylindrical tube of exceptionally strong and entirely transparent alien crystal. This tubular shaft stands at the centerpoint of the lobby and extends upward and downward to the levels above and below. A small door located in a back corner of the room leads to an emergency stairwell. Another door leads north into a noisy bustling gift shop.

22:08 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:08 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

22:08 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

22:08 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

22:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:08 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

22:09 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

22:09 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:09 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:09 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:09 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:09 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

23:32 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

23:32 You can't launch from here.

23:32 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:32 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

23:32 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:32 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:32 You're already sitting down.

23:32 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

23:32 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:32 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:32 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:32 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:32 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

23:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

23:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

23:33 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

23:33 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:34 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and a gray trash can here.
