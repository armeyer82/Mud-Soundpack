Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service
robot, a compact white refrigerator, and Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo
here.

ftl mir
The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its
existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased
destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris
still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.
Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting
vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to Mir."
Constantine Stone says, "I see, so like when I transfer at orion and I see the
org gets a fraction of what I get."

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Constantine Stone asks, "A bunch of orgs are getting that?"
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Constantine Stone
He appears to be 22 years old. He is about six feet and one inch tall and has
fair skin. His body is of average build with narrow hips and strong calves. He
has broad shoulders and a wide chest. His face is long and boyish, with a
straight nose and cleft chin. His lips are faintly upturned and light-colored
and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of
dark eyebrows, his eyes are grey and narrow. His close-cropped, bristly hair is
chestnut brown with slate blue streaks and mostly unkempt but standing on end
down the middle in a faux hawk. He also has chestnut brown stubble. He has
neatly trimmed light pink fingernails. He has a past injury on his right
eyebrow.
 He is wearing a dark blue corduroy blazer, an off-white cotton dress shirt, a
dark brown leather belt with a square copper buckle, a pair of casually tailored
red khakis, and a pair of soft dark brown suede boots. He is also wearing a
keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, an ice blue
metachannel FTL communicator, a sturdy dark green canvas backpack, a plain flat
einrophone in a dark blue reinforced plastic phone holster, and a thick
synthleather bandolier with large pockets. His head, face, both eyes, neck, both
wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a
planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The
wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an
eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

Star Conquest Help: Rerolling
--
Category: Background
--
Rerolling is the process of deleting your character and creating a new one. The
term derives from tabletop roleplaying games, where a character's stats had to
be determined from dice rolls, and thus to "reroll" was to start over with your
character. In character in Star Conquest, this process is usually called
"retiring" your character.
There are many reasons that people choose to reroll. The best reason to reroll
is that you feel your current character's story has been told and you'd like to
try something new. If this is your reason, and your character has been
well-roleplayed and your account is in good standing, please use the SUPPORT
command to speak to a host about your thoughts for ending your current character
and transitioning to a new one. We can help you finish your character's story
and often even arrange for some of your character's progress (usually just
points) to be gradually transferred to the new character. If your character has
NOT usually been well-roleplayed, we are less likely to do these things. Please
read Policy 14: Minievents for more information.
You should not invent your own wild retirement stories, nor have your next
character or your out-of-game friends try to invent things about your old
character. In the past, we've had rerolled characters supposedly die in horrible
accidents, be drafted into the navy, become an advisor to the president, and
somehow turn into a giant Bari, all of which were incompatible with the game's
theme. If you want a story for the end of your character besides quiet
retirement, you MUST speak to a host.
We have stated the best reason to reroll. There are also many poor reasons to
reroll, which are unfortunately more common than good ones. Here are some that
we see regularly:
* You did something silly, such as attacking an alliance-mate, and you don't
care for the consequences.
* You are unhappy with your organization, but talking to people is hard and
rerolling is easy.
* You are unhappy with your boyfriend/girlfriend, but breaking up is frightening
and rerolling is easy.
* You did something wrong out-of-character, such as scripting combat, and got a
penalty.
There are two things that every good roleplayer learns to deal with:
consequences and interpersonal conflict. You cannot expect your character to be
happy all of the time. Sometimes, you will do things that your character will
just have to live with. Sometimes, you will have to have hard, even unpleasant
conversations with other characters. These things are all part of a character's
story, not a reason to end it. It's the human experience.
Remember that bad things tend to pass. In roleplaying games, memories are short.
If you did something bad, you can probably be turning over a new leaf by next
month. If you're in the midst of a bad breakup, you'll probably both have moved
on in two weeks. Think twice before destroying a long-term character over
short-term issues. It's always better to weave something new into your
character's tapestry than to rip the whole thing up and start over.
Playing through a bad situation makes both you and your character stronger.
Rerolling is simply a passive-aggressive easy out. We will always encourage
players to stick with their characters in situations like these.
If you are committed to rerolling, there is one more important "don't": this is
not the time to take parting shots at your former friends, your alliance, your
organization, etc., nor is it time to suddenly launch your finest warship with
guns blazing to see how much damage you can do. Doing these things with the
knowledge that your character won't last the hour is out-of-character and
essentially metagaming. If you are going to have it out with other characters,
make it part of the ongoing story. The alternative may be satisfying for you,
but it's frustrating for everyone else.
If you rerolled purely to avoid consequences or for other essentially
out-of-character reasons, your character may be given a "reroll" tag on the WHO
list to denote this.
The process to reroll your character is to log out of Star Conquest, log back
in, and choose the "Delete Character" option. Follow the prompts, then create a
new character at the main menu.
There are three reasons why a character has been deleted:
1) You have violated policy repeatedly or proven yourself unable to play the
game without being a detriment to other players or the game itself.
2) You have not played the game in over six months AND had less than 1000
aggregate points.
3) You deleted the character yourself manually, for a reason mentioned above.
With none of the above being true, your character WILL exist in some fashion.
If 1) is true, your character will not be restored under any circumstances. 
Depending on the situation your account may also have been banned, in which case
you will no longer be eligible to play the game.
If 2) is true, then creating a new character with your old account and opening a
SUPPORT ticket in order to speak to us is the correct course of action if you
wish for your character to be restored.  However, if your previous character had
not left cadethood or had less than 100 points, we strongly suggested that you
simply use the newer character.  You may still request a restoration, though we
will explain why it is not a good idea.  If you have been actively playing the
game with your new character prior to the restoration request then it will be
denied.
If 3) is true, there is a 48 hour 'Deleter's Remorse' grace period where you may
create a new character and open a SUPPORT ticket in order to have the deleted
character restored.  Beyond this point, we will NOT restore a manually deleted
character.  If you create a new character and actively play the game with the
new character, the grace period is rendered void. 
Be aware that the nature of the deletion will also play a part in whether the
character is restored - accidentally choosing 'Delete Character' and somehow
confirming twice is one thing.  Screaming over the comm that you hate everyone
and are going to go help the Outsiders exterminate humanity before deleting is
another.
To play a character different to your current one, you MUST delete your current
character.  Multiple accounts are against policy as stated in Policy 9, and
there is no need to create a new account if a CHARACTER has been deleted. 
Accounts do NOT get deleted.
Occasionally you may TEMPORARILY be unable to delete your character - this will
always be for a specific reason: You are in a liaison role, you are active in
the middle of an ongoing plotline, you are not in a location that makes sense
for a character to 'retire' from, or you have specifically requested that we
make you unable to delete your character.
What will be restored along with your character?
When a character is restored, all points they had at the point of deletion will
also be restored, as will any credits they had on them at that point.
However, items are usually unrecoverable and cannot be returned to you - the
character will most likely be naked and have no containers.  Any clothing,
books, workbenches, etc that they had are gone.  Any robots or other items will
likewise be gone, as will apartments.
Starships are not immediately purged upon their destruction or the deletion of a
character but ARE removed from the game world and are placed in a temporary
'limbo'. After a grace period any starship in this location will be deleted.  If
the restoration of the character occurs before the next starship recycling,
there is a POSSIBILITY that any ships previously owned by that player can be
restored.  If it is after the starship recycling period, the character's ships
will be gone forever.
This is why an idle-purged character that was relatively new will often not be
restored, as without ships or items it becomes very difficult for a 'new'
character to play the game.

You can quit by using the @QUIT command, or by just closing your client. The
effect is the same.
Alternatively, keep in mind that you can remain idle in the game for as long as
you want. If you think you'll want to play again a little later, use the DOZE
command to take yourself off the WHO list and remain connected.
You do not need to save before quitting. The server automatically saves all game
information, including character status, at regular intervals.
You should, however, take care to quit in a private location, such as inside
your ship or in an apartment. Your character will still be in the game world,
asleep, and other players can still move you around while you sleep!
Also take care to land your ship and power it down before quitting. If you leave
your ship in space while you sleep, it is vulnerable to theft or destruction.
Disconnected players are invulnerable to most attacks, such as unarmed combat.
However, this protection does not kick in for several minutes, so disconnecting
is not a viable option for avoiding attack.

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense

A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service
robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.

Hello Ather,
SEAS has established their Genetics Lab. Since newer organizations no longer
receive a plant cutting with their Shell, we are seeking to buy a few unneutered
cuttings.
We would appreciate it if you would provide us with a list of six or more of the
most beneficial plant cuttings you would be willing to sell and their respective
costs and how they would be prepared for delivery. Also what would be their
respective selling price for a neutered plant?
Since we haven't submitted our first cutting yet, we're not certain how many
plants we can maintain and doubt there will be many available slots at this time
as we haven't a lot of command. We hope to maintain 3 or 4 though and these will
primarily be utilized amongst the current three members of SEAS or for future
members and aboard our organization's ships. If anyone approaches us though we
would sell cuttings which are neutered but we have no plans to actively promote
the sale of plants other than any unique Hybrids which we may be fortunate
enough to develop.
We would appreciate the opportunity to do business with your organization.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head,

Thanks for appraising us. I didn't know that it existed as I don't typically
review the available funds. I will definitely contribute as this is great for
new pilots. I will also inform new pilots as I assume the role of Ground Squad
Leader again this next Term. - Lily Kaise

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service
robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.
You can go south and out.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service
robot here.

[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking
bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an
individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly
seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and
hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very
well built and maintained station.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service
robot, and Mischief the large black felo here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps
its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the airlock.
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a
chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.
[0m[Miriani] From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you
hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Acrylon to Triskaideka flight
control, there's been an attack in the sector."[0m
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in AEU/Debate.
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a
fuchsia glowing interior pulsates gently.
Mischief the large black felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles
around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
