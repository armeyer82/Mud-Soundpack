[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "7777."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "If one does not work, try the other."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Also be sure your friend uses the REFER
command to give you credit for referring them to the game."

[Newbie Help] Cadet Aeva Carsen transmits, "Yeah I can't think why he all of a

firewall."
Xavier the sleeping big silver soldier felo blinks a few times, stands up, and

7771. Also have him restart the computer."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Aeva Carsen transmits, "That makes no sense why everything
including other MUDs would let him connect. It's only SC that's giving him
trouble for some reason."

you never know, a computer restart fixes many odd issues."

also tried 7771 and no go. I'm having him restart to see if that fixes it, but
again, since he's just updated, he came back from a fresh restart... shrugs."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Only other thing I could suggest is have
him go to the website and contact staff that way. He'd need to provide the
specific error he's getting through his client."

Mischief the large black felo jumps down from Lily Kaise's lap.
[Newbie Help] Cadet Aeva Carsen transmits, "Specified service name is invalid.
Yet he hasn't changed anything client side since the update. I'm totally at a
loss."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Best bet is to have him contact staff
through the website I'd imagine. Other than that I don't know."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Try using the IP address numbers
instead of the name?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Did you try a restart?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And or check the spelling, just to be
sure? There could be a typo?"
[Newbie Help] Cadet Aeva Carsen transmits, "I'll have him restart real quick.
Next step will be to try the IP address. What is it?"
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "104.181.170.164."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Aeva Carsen transmits, "Noted."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo rubs up against a round white rattan coffee

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
