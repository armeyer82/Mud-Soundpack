[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Star Conquest Help: Pilot Contract
--
Category: Background
--
The three planetary alliances (along with the EAOS) have many differing laws. 
The laws that they share are known informally as 'interalliance law' and cover
all of known alliance space and its inhabitants.  One such shared legal aspect
is the civilian pilot program.
At its most basic, the civilian pilot program is a set of laws relating to how,
why and when a person with a civilian pilot licence is able to do things that -
for the majority of the population - would be illegal or at least ill-advised,
such as operating a car-sized laser or launching massive explosive warheads at a
significant fraction of the speed of light.
PRE-CONTRACT
In order to be eligible to enter the civilian pilot program and attain a
licence, certain things must be true (though this is not a conclusive list):
* The person must be 16 years old or more in order to begin learning
* The person must be 18 years old or more in order to legally sign the pilot
contract
* The person must be in good physical health
* The person must be in good mental health
* The person must have no significant criminal record
* The person must be trained in spaceflight law and regulations 
* The person must be trained to operate space weaponry safely (such as laser
turrets and torpedo launchers - initially this would be simulator-based for
safety reasons)
* The person must be able to operate a starship safely
* The person must have reached 300 recorded flight hours without incident
There are other aspects but they are unlikely to be a consideration for most
players.
In general, gaining the civilian pilot licence can be thought of as similar to a
combination of a commercial driving licence (USA) and a private pilot's licence
(FAA/CAA) in real life. 
The various alliances each have different age laws relating to consent,
adulthood, and when an individual can do or use specific things.  In the case of
the pilot contract, interalliance law needed to be unified so while the League
age of majority is 18, the Fringe is 16.  To allow for this, citizens of all
planetary alliances are elegible to begin training at the age of 16, but must
wait until the age of 18 before actually being elegible to attain the licence
itself, to allow for the legality of signing the pilot contract as an adult.
The potential civilian pilot must also visit a doctor and psychologist in order
to attain certificates of good physical and mental health.  Many seemingly minor
physical issues may actually prevent a potential pilot from efficiently
controlling their starship, while mental issues have multiple knock-on effects
that could lead to problems beyond the individual.
As civilian pilots have access to vast wealth and advanced technology, as well
as interact with the other alliances in ways the average citizen does not -
leading to in effect the civilian pilot program often being a de facto
diplomatic system between planetary alliances and also the first diplomatic
action with others (such as alien species) - citizens wishing to become a
civilian pilot must have a reputation in good standing; a criminal record does
not suggest that a civilian pilot will uphold their end of the civilian
contract, nor would they be trustworthy when interacting with others as the
representatives of their respective alliance.
There is no specific curriculum and there are no academies or literal 'schools'
where people take classes; instead people pay for individual lessons from
licenced instructors, usually lasting between one to two hours at a time.  They
must also learn the necessary laws and regulations regarding atmospheric and
space travel, air space laws, landing clearance and docking permission
regulations, etc.
A written exam is taken when the potential pilot feels confident that they know
and understand the laws and regulations, and this is the only aspect that can be
explicitly 'failed' - like the written portion of a driving test, too many
incorrect answers will end your ability to continue, and you must wait at least
six months before you can re-take the written exam.  This is usually done prior
to or alongside the initial stages of flight training with an instructor. 
Passing this written exam gives a potential pilot a two year 'window' within
which to complete all other necessary training.  If the pilot contract is not
signed in this timeframe, the exam must be taken again.
Once the written exam is successfully completed, it all depends on the
instructor ticking off various checkboxes in their training checklist for the
potential pilot.  Understanding of components, ability to do pre-flight checks,
correct request for launch/landing, etc.  Each of these will only be ticked off
when the instructor is convinced that the potential pilot is capable, not merely
on the first 'success'.  After all the tickboxes have been completed, the only
remaining aspect before the attaining of the licence is to reach the mandatory
flight hours to be considered a civilian pilot.
CONTENTS OF THE CONTRACT
A potential civilian pilot, once they have completed their training (and if all
other elements are considered acceptable) will have the option of signing
various forms of pilot contract:
* CIVILIAN PILOT CONTRACT - The licence for a freelancer civilian as part of the
civilian pilot program.
* CORPORATE/MERCHANT PILOT CONTRACT - The licence for working exclusively for a
specific corporation as a merchant transport or passenger pilot.
* GOVERNMENT PILOT CONTRACT - The licence for government-mandated flights that
do not fall under the civilian pilot program or the navy.
While the training undertaken in order to attain a civilian pilot's licence will
aid someone if they choose to enlist in the alliance navy, it gives no hard
benefit and there is no 'contract' as with the other options - joining the navy
is a very different category.
The only way to gain a civilian pilot licence is by signing the civilian pilot
contract.  All trainees or cadets are free to defer or reject the basic civilian
pilot contract (perhaps in order to take on a corporate or government contract
as mentioned above) but any deferment can only last up to two years without some
form of contract being signed.  If no contract has been signed after the
deferment period ends, a potential pilot will need to re-take the written laws
and regulation exam and have an instructor re-confirm their skillset. 
In-game, the playerbase consists only of pilots who have signed the civilian
pilot contract.  We have no plans to add in purely corporate or government pilot
options at the present time.
The text of the pilot contract is freely available, but it is a legal document
that was drafted by interalliance lawyers during the creation of the unified
civilian pilot program and as such is filled with legalese and is not an easy
read.  The governments of the planetary alliances have responded to this in
different ways.
The AEU offers no 'normal language' documentation or any service to assist in
understanding the pilot contract, having ended this option after the removal
from office of President Christopher Sheffield - the expectation today is that
any AEU citizen who plans to sign the contract should be able to afford a lawyer
to interpret the document for them.
The League offers a 'normal language' pamphlet that gives the basic run-down of
the contents of the pilot contract, as well as a free 'limited discussion'
service where potential civilian pilots can meet with a member of the civilian
pilot program liaison branch office on their respective homeworld in order to
talk about the finer points of the contract itself.  This gives a good basic
grounding and understanding of the contents of the contract, but may not give
reasoning behind many of the regulations.  As with the AEU, League citizens are
able to pay for a lawyer from their own pocket to explain the intricacies of the
pilot contract in more detail, but this is rare due to the liaison roundtable
option.
Prior to the military coup the Fringe offered a service similar to the League,
though nowhere near as thorough.  Post-coup, the military have taken control of
the liaison office and as such civilian pilots discuss the pilot contract with
them.  This has often been seen as a conflict of interests by the other
planetary alliances and the EAOS, with a significant number of potential
civilian pilots choosing instead to enlist in the Fringe navy - but no change
seems likely.  However, the Fringe military do give basic details on the
contents of the pilot contract and do not appear to mislead potential civilian
pilots, merely attempt to guide them to a more 'patriotic' option.
* Section A of the pilot contract lays out the requirements relating to
elegibility for civilian pilothood, as stated in the previous section above.
* Sections B and C cover various potential industrial tasks a civilian pilot is
expected to be competent in the execution of in order to benefit their
respective alliance - from salvaging useful debris to asteroid hauling to
mining.  As new industrial tasks emerge thanks to technological advancement and
other discoveries, these sections are amended and civilian pilots must sign
addendum documents to confirm understanding of the new addition(s) to the pilot
contract.
* Section D covers alliance government subsidies of various technologies,
related devices, and other aspects of civilian pilot work - such as starships,
upgrades, and alliance research.
* Section E covers hostility and conflict resolution between alliances,
specifically what civilian pilots are legally expected and not legally able to
do during times of interalliance war or heightened tension.  For instance, by
signing the pilot contract, a potential pilot is agreeing to actively wage war
on naval and civilian forces that are part of an alliance that has declared war
on their own, while they are also agreeing they will not cause planetary
devastation by atmospheric assault.  An addendum involving drop pods and
battlesuits was included after their redeployment.
- Section E-c.1 specifically covers corporate and courier conflict and the legal
result of any cross-alliance (or internal alliance) conflict involving courier
or merchant work. This is one of the first major 'legalese' sections, requiring
legal knowledge in order to properly untangle.
* Section F covers hostility and conflict resolution between the potential
pilot's alliance and non-alliance factions such as pirates.  In simplified
language, pirates are usually considered 'alliance entities' under most law,
this section simply expands on suitable response to pirate activity, whether it
be from members of their own alliance or from another alliance.  In general, the
spirit of the pilot contract states that pirates must be stopped even if they do
not appear to be actively engaging in anti-alliance activity, but the letter of
the contract only states that anti-alliance activity from a pirate must be met
with force.
* Section G covers hostility and conflict resolution between the potential
pilot's alliance and non-alliance factions such as unregistered persons.  See
below.
* Section H covers interaction (hostile and non-hostile) between the potential
pilot's alliance and non-human factions such as alien species.  In general, this
section only details how to act during a First Contact scenario (basically 'do
not antagonise potential alien allies' and 'attempt to learn about them') but
since the encounters with the Jinu, Outsiders, IFS, Children of the Sun,
Testudinidae, and rift entities such as Euclid, there are multiple addendums
involving each of them and specific situations involving various scenarios.  In
general, this section of the contract boils down to 'unless the alien species is
actively at war with our alliance, do not initiate combat, but if we are at war
feel free to strike first'.  There is no specific addendum regarding
communication with hostile aliens, but this section does suggest being cautious
with information being passed to entities hostile to the potential pilot's
alliance.
* Sections I, J, and K cover the Centauri Seven Accords - these sections are
large and contain the most 'legalese' of the entire contract.
- Section I covers the nature of civilian pilot wealth accumulation and the
creation of a 'pilot economy' to ensure the sanctity and safety of the alliance
economies, including how tax rates and exchange rates are dealt with on a
per-alliance basis.
- Section J covers interaction and limitation between the pilot economy and
general alliance economies, including how much credit can be safely transferred
into non-pilot accounts over how long, regulations about pilot retirement and
the investment of pilot wealth into specialised trust funds for slow lifetime
release via stipend, and how an active pilot can request the release of funding
to the general alliance economy for a specific purpose or a retired pilot can
request additional access to their pilot wealth beyond the normal stipend in
order to purchase or invest in non-pilot activities.
- Section K covers legislation relating to limitation of pilot movement,
specifying which areas are 'pilot accessible' (such as spaceports, space
stations, etc) which areas are considered 'semi-accessible' (such as cities like
Landfall and Ixtapa) and areas which are completely inaccessible to civilian
pilots (such as the majority of normal towns and cities on a planet).
* Section L covers civilian pilot travel to locations outside those specified in
Section K, like unknown space stations or alien environs.  In effect, this
section describes how a potential pilot is, under specific circumstances,
treated as a diplomatic envoy and is expected to act accordingly.
* Section M covers the Mutuality and the Grand Amnesty.  It mentions how members
of the Mutuality are part of a unique organisational entity with alliance-like
traits and are not, by the technical definition of the law, covered by the unreg
bounty even though they are unregistered individuals under the umbrella term of
an alliance-like organisational entity.  In addition, it clarifies some elements
of interalliance law surrounding the still-active unreg bounty laws - stating
that while they are still in effect, any unregistered person who became
unregistered prior to the date 21st August 2304 is considered inelegible for the
bounty under the Grand Amnesty.
* Section N covers the Outsiders post-Subjugation, giving them a separate label
to other alien species and clarifying that potential pilots agree to engage them
in combat if encountered in beaconed space.  There is also the provision that
potential pilots agree to engage Outsider forces in combat if encountered in
non-beaconed space, but this has a clarifier that it only applies if there is a
realistic chance of victory and retreat would cause greater danger to humanity. 
A post-Resistance addendum includes the provision that as the Outsiders now want
the total extinction of humanity they cannot in any way be negotiated with,
copying interalliance law which states that any human found to be attempting
diplomacy with Outsiders is guilty of treason and will be charged without trial
under military law.
SIDE NOTE: THE UNREG PROBLEM
Section G of the pilot contract is long and detailed, with quite a significant
connection to interalliance law on unregistered persons.  Since the Subjugation
and Resistance, many interalliance laws relating to unregistered entities have
been altered, rewritten, or struck down - but not all.  With the Grand Amnesty
and retitling of the Sovereign Mutuality of Disparate Freemen from 'unregistered
faction' to 'alliance-like entity' and giving it legal status as an alliance
without it being the same as the planetary alliances, much interalliance law
relating to unregs has become either murky, irrelevant, or contradictory.
Large subsections of Section G no longer exist - there are several blank or
mostly blank pages where subsections and paragraphs used to be that defined
proper civilian pilot reaction and response to various unregistered entity
actions or activities.
Some subsections still exist, but the laws they refer to have been amended and
now make these subsections of the pilot contract sound like nonsense.
Other subsections still exist, with the laws they reference also existing in
their original state, but due to interaction with other laws it becomes a legal
tangle which law takes precedence and whether these subsections are still
applicable and whether a civilian pilot still falls under their remit or is
legally obliged to obey them.
Many civilian pilots who flew prior to the Subjugation found this shift
incredibly difficult following the Grand Amnesty - after signing a contract that
required them to respond to unregs in a specific way, they were now being
punished for doing so - but not always, not for the same thing, and not with the
same severity.  In response, many pre-Subjugation civilian pilots chose to
retire before they had their licences revoked, or otherwise wanted to get away
from such a confusing state of affairs.
The addition of Section M helped clarify some portions of the previous
confusion, but added further complications.  By the literal interpretation of
the Grand Amnesty, people who 'went unreg' prior to the amnesty (regardless of
what they did beforehand) were now no longer considered covered by the unreg
bounty or any other laws relating to 'going unreg'.  However, children of
unregistered persons who were born after 21st August 2304 are not covered by the
Amnesty as it is written - does this mean civilian pilots must capture and bring
unreg children back to their alliances for punishment?  A literal and technical
interpretation of the pilot contract would say yes, while the spirit of the
interpretation would say it was an unintentional oversight.
SIGNING THE CONTRACT
So a potential pilot has read up on the civilian pilot contract, they've spoken
to the League Liaison office, their personal AEU lawyer, or the Fringe military
to get enough details, or they've just said 'screw it I don't need to know
this', and are ready to sign the contract and get their licence.
Signing the contract must be done at a registered government location, with the
potential pilot providing ID and evidence that they have passed the laws and
regulations exam and showing their instructor-ticked pilot skillset document
which confirms their knowledge and flight hours.  Once signed, the potential
pilot will have to wait approximately two-to-four weeks for background checks,
legal changes to their status (including their credit account being flagged as
owned by a pilot and the initial pilot loan being granted to them) and putting
their affairs in order before they are limited from general access to their
previous home.  
After this time they will be contacted and informed that their licence
documentation is ready to be picked up at the same local government office,
being held there for up to three months before being sent back to the main
liaison office for security reasons if it is not collected before then. Once the
new pilot has collected their licence documentation and dressed in the
regulation plain gray shipsuit, they will be taken to the liaison office within
the spaceport on their capital world, where they will be greeted by a liaison
officer and be free to begin their civilian pilot career.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

coffee table with a glass top, a small purple trash bin, a wall-sized bubbling
neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks,
a robotic chef named Nellie, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari
horde noisemaker, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval dark purple and
light purple cloth rug, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

There is now a HELP PILOT CONTRACT to give some additional background towards
what civilian pilots in the planetary alliances actually agree to when they gain
their licences.  This does not apply to Mutuality characters, naturally.  If
anything in it does not make sense or you feel requires clarification, please

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval dark purple and
light purple cloth rug, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted
tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, Kiska the
humanoid service robot, a compact red refrigerator, a compact white
refrigerator, an insulated green cooler, an insulated pink cooler, and an

have begun moving in, rejuvenating the entire area. New offices now occupy the
old buildings, and even though outward repairs have begun only slowly, the area
already has a bustling atmosphere. A leveled building has been replaced with a
small plaza. A small hair care shop has recently opened here.

next to each other in the same building: 'Freneza,' which has in its front
windows displays of hosiery, belts, and odd-looking bracelets; and 'Studdedly,'
which occupies the corner of the building and advertises with hand-made signs
its low-priced stock of wrist bands and chokers. A number of glum and edgy
people seem to hang around these shops, their spiked hair and unique dress
setting them apart from the usual shoppers.

businesses has brought a new atmosphere of bustle and success to the area. On

delightful-looking breakfast restaurant with a large plate glass window in the

constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the

away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green

The fires from the chasms dissipate, and the platform levels off.
A colossal blast creates gaping cracks to open up all around in the earth and
the ground begins shuddering relentlessly.  The platform shakes violently from
turbulence.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh shooot."

The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
A groping hand clutches your shoulder. You charge forward in sheer panic.
You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.
You might have lost him.
The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

Lily Kaise sighs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "We're so close and I can't detect
anything on the sensors with this storm."
Lily Kaise presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship
begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Lily Kaise activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections
and recent ping returns.
Lily Kaise turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming the
riftsail to 100%.
Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
Lily Kaise sighs.
Lily Kaise activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections

The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
The tunnel widens, the ship tumbling as it speeds through.
With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the
tunnel.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I think we drifted east a little but
that area should be large enough for us to identify even in this storm I would
think."
The tunnel narrows once more.
The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.
Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in
the opposite direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 240.0, 0.0.

The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
Whatever is carrying the fishbowl begins moving more quickly, causing the water
to swirl tremendously.
The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.
Lily Kaise turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming the

Rotten fruit and spinning bottles fly at you from the darkness. The room spins
dizzyingly.
The heat from the stage light is oppressive.
The faceless people in the crowd redirect their ire to each other for a few
moments.
You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.
