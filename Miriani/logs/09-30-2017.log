04:18 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovlin: Hello and good evening I am a brand new player to MOO gaming. I have a few general questions about Miriani if that's okay...

04:18 [Newbie] Olivia Cantrell: Sure thing.

04:19 [Newbie] Olivia Cantrell: I'll try to answer anything I can.

04:19 [Newbie] Fawkes Fogwell: Hello! Please read help getting started, it will answer many common questions.

04:20 [Newbie] Fawkes Fogwell: Help FAQ and help introduction are also helpful resources.

04:21 [Newbie] Olivia Cantrell: That too. But if you do need help, don't be afraid to ask. There are many friendly hosts and players alike who can generally answer your questions. And many help files as well.

04:21 #$#hjelp

04:23 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovlin: Reading though the rules and policies mostly everything seems to revolve around in game conflicts. Is Miriani really THAT PvP focused of a game? My intrest with the game is to RP and sorta establish a cozy sci-fi life here, not to worry about consant RP wars and stuff like that. Some of it is okay but I am just wondering how much conflict really exists in this game between you guys. (I'm not competitive)

04:23 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: That's up to you. There can be RP wars here but if you'd like to simply RP, that's all right too.

04:23 [Newbie] Naomi Grason: It's all about how you roleplay your character, you can be PVP or not be.

04:24 [Newbie] Naomi Grason: Just be creative, develop your char, go with the flow.

04:24 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: Which isn't to say that PVP won't find you from time to time, but once you know your way around, you can generally avoid it.

04:24 #$#hjelp

04:24 [Newbie] Naomi Grason: Yep.

04:25 [Newbie] Cara West: It's life. You're going to have gerks here, since they're roleplaying gerks. You'll have pirates here which is totally legal, but there's ways to protect yourself. The rp here is pretty open ended. If you want to be a gerk, a pirate, a person who roleplays with their 24 kids and or pets it's up to you.

04:25 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: You can actually be attacked for any reason really. Just learn from the experience and move on.

04:25 [Newbie] Naomi Grason: Some of us would be happy to teach you.

04:28 #$#hjelp

04:28 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovlin: A text game like this with all the crazy complex commands and such is pretty daunting. But I really didn't wanna join a trigger happy PvP fest. Everything else I read sounded great. There isn't any sort of IC and OOC mentor program for Miriani is there? I do have some more questions but would rather not blow up everyone's screen with them.

04:29 [Newbie] Cara West: No. No mentor system like star conquest. Though like people said they don't mind answering questions.

04:29 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: PVP really isn't as bad as it was a few years ago.

04:29 [Newbie] Olivia Cantrell: I'd be happy to help any way I could.

04:31 #$#hjelp

04:34 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovlin: This is my first text game so I don't know what star conquest was... Though I read it was what this was based off of. Alright I guess I'll just have to ask a few questions here. 1) I am not a very fast typer. And I smell horrible usually. Is that going to be a huge issue or are the players here generally welcoming enough to let me gather my thoughts before I react? 2) is there some kind of system in place where we all can design our own clothing as in the descriptions and things? I'm really looking for a game like this with deep customization with clothes and all sorts of other stuff. Nothing silly but being able to 'make' my outfits or tech things would appeal to me greatly.

04:35 #$#hjelp

04:35 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: First question: If you're not that great with spelling, take a look at spell-options. The spellchecker isn't perfect, but it will help catch most misspellings and typos.

04:36 [Newbie] Fawkes Fogwell: Not to worry, a vast majority of the players on this game have a spelling deficiency of some level.

04:36 [Newbie] Cara West: If you smell horrible no one's going to know. Second. You can't design your own clothing as it were, but there's several places with pretty good clothing options. Just ask in char if anyone knows any good clothing stores.

04:38 #$#hjelp

04:41 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovlin: That's... A real pity. Very sad. I hope there's a great selection of options. 3) I read something about adult role-play rules... Is that allowed here? Is it shunned or pretty common place? This too might intrest me but then again its all in character so I'd have to see how my chracter develops and who she encounters. I'm just asking to understand what is or isn't acceptable for this game.

04:42 [Newbie] Cara West: As long as you don't get into it with someone underage...

04:42 [Newbie] Jason Harkness: Have a look at the policies. That should be a good place to start.

04:42 #$#hjelp

04:42 [Newbie] Fawkes Fogwell: Since Miriani allows players under the age of 18, we must be careful about what content they're exposed to and what activities they engage in. For this reason, this policy strictly forbids any minors (individuals under the age of 18) from engaging in roleplay or out of character actions of a sexual nature. Under no circumstances should a minor seek out sexual encounters, offer sexual encounters to others, negotiate contact information with others for the purposes of engaging in sexual activities outside of the game, or engage in sexual discussions of any kind.

04:44 [Newbie] Olivia Cantrell: I mean, I think adult rollplay is fine, just as long as the player is not under the age of 18 and you aren't herassing said player.

04:45 #$#hjelp

04:46 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovlin: ...I read the policies. They just said underage players RL are not allowed. I was asking if most of the adults here wade into that side of RP or if its something taboo. Maybe that clearifies my question a bit better. 4) I can't get this Mariani HUD add-on to 'connect' to my client. At the recomendation of the page I use VMoo. When I run the add-on it says nobody is connected in the WHO tab. I don't see any ini file or anything to set the thing up.

04:47 [Newbie] Cara West: People don't shy away from it no.

04:48 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: Hmm. I don't think many people use the HUD.

04:49 #$#hjelp

04:51 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovlin: The hud looks like it would be handy. Damage areas and the map thingie. I'd like to get it working if its still fucntional.... And maybe even a soundpack eventually. Which allaince is the most popular? I'm in the starting room to pick mine. I think I'd like to know which one(s) have a strong player base so I don't mess up and seperate myself from the start.

04:52 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: I wouldn't go off of the alliances for support. I'd use the alliances to determine what sort of RP do you want to do. Do you want to travel? Fight? Be peaceful?

04:52 [Newbie] Cara West: They're all pretty equal, no one alliance is really better than another.

04:52 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: Alliance truly doesn't mean as much as it should these days. The most it an alliance does is let you get different specialty starships later on.

04:52 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: You strike me as CW, so that would be my recommendation.

04:52 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: And, what he said.

04:53 [Newbie] Fawkes Fogwell: Allessondria, the best advice we can give you is to try the game out and enjoy learning the different aspects of it. A lot of your questions are borderline in character, you're basically asking things you would find out through the normal course of playing the game at this point. If you have questions about commands, moving around, things like that, those are the questions for this channel. Its not really for discussing the political climate of in character Alliances or giving you 'pro tips'. Not trying to be rude, but honestly just give it a try.

04:54 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: You will have the ability to switch your alliance later if you're not happy with it.

18:53 ["Starlight Express" Living Quarters 1] (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.
You can go southeast.
