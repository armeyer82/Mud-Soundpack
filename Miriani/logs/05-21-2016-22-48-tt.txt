Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a glossy
pale pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather
captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a
hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a
small white trash bin, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a
clear plastic food storage container, Purr the humanoid service robot, and
Sassie the large fuchsia felo here.

Xavier the big silver soldier felo
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely wolf-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, spotted silver fur,
possessing a short, thin tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
long, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, hooked black claws,
visible only when not retracted. A orange, vertical nose sits below a pair of
clear indigo eyes with horizontal pupils.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Kaboom"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.
You see a swiveling dark blue leather gunner's chair and an improved temporary
wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

You grin.
Lily grins.
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then
spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.
Kim Saunders just arrived.
Lily says, "O'oops sorry."
Lily laughs.

says in a New Bristol accent. "And all set."
Lily says to Kim, "I didn't see you."
Lily grins.
Joel Kringle stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.
Lily asks, "Ok everyone ready?"
Kim says, "I only just walked in."
'heh, she just arrived.

A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.
Lily nods.

here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
Kim Saunders nods. "I am."
The four-person mule "Daisy May" is slowly brought in aboard an automated
flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
You follow Lily Kaise aboard the four-person mule "Daisy May".
[Starship "Daisy May"; Airlock]
You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a felo nest, a hefty red
soldier felo, a big red bobtailed felo, a big red winged felo, and a hefty red
soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

this ship.
You follow Lily Kaise into the ship.
[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple
cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored
patchwork fabric with a sleeping big red soldier felo kitten on it, a large oval
white and light yellow cloth rug, and Emmylou the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
Joel Kringle says into his sleek platinum communicator watch with sapphire
accents, "Yes yes, sorry."
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Daisy May, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "Gotta love interruptability of speech."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area
is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
Joel Kringle says into his sleek platinum communicator watch with sapphire
accents, "Nope."
A big red winged felo wanders in from the airlock.
Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.
Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Ok head for the fort if you want."
Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello
there, Daisy May! Welcome to home space!"
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
Joel Kringle glances down at his watch momentarily.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

Joel Kringle says into his sleek platinum communicator watch with sapphire
accents, "So no furnace of high low system."
Joel Kringle says into his sleek platinum communicator watch with sapphire
accents, "Correct."
You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."
Joel Kringle whistles.
You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires
its descent thrusters.
i
You are wearing a blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and
cuffs and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers.
Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of
black socks.
You are also wearing a keychain, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black
leather phone holster, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic silver
metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the
side, and a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins.
You are concealing a leather briefcase, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera
bag, an asteroid hauling supply kit, a flight control scanner, a large
expandable telescoping xenology container, a black engineering tool case, and a
thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.
Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
You are carrying nothing.

You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AEU Combat
Supporter from storage and sets it in front of you.
An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the
battlesuit's weapons.

[Aerial Fortress "Petunia"; Deployment]
The aerial fortress appears to be at Old Frontier Processor.
You see an AEU Combat Supporter here.
Joel Kringle is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering
position near the space station's docking bay.
Joel Kringle says into his sleek platinum communicator watch with sapphire
accents, "If you don't mind yours just to make things a lil easier."
You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.
enter
You press a button on an AEU Combat Supporter, which splits open down the front.
You carefully climb inside.
launch
You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a
battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!
You can go north.

[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple
cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored
patchwork fabric with a sleeping big red soldier felo kitten on it, a large oval
white and light yellow cloth rug, Emmylou the humanoid service robot, and a big
red soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise and Kim Saunders are standing here.
You can go south and out.
Emmylou the humanoid service robot pours some low-grade dry Felo Chow into a

Emmylou the humanoid service robot clomps south.
"So, tomorrow you are headed off to Hall of pain," Kim says. "Wish I could go
too, but that will need to happen some other time."
Lily says, "Aww wish you could as you would be welcome to fly with us."

You nod to Kim. "Yeah, wish you could too."
Emmylou the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.
"Well," says Kim, "I have an expedition to prepare."
"Bue once I see what's along the way," says Lily, "I can probably take us there
again."

You nod.
Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "I meant but."
"Why are you taking your own ship then?" Kim asks. "Is there no room on
Melinda's ship?"
Lily says, "Well she didn't invite me initially."
"And since it's a carrier it's pretty limited with life support at around 8,"
Lily says.
Kim asks, "Oh, she is taking a carrier?"
Lily says, "I just kind of like doing it anyway in case we want to come back
sooner."
Lily says, "Yes so those guys can take out their own ships to artifact with."
A big red soldier felo rubs up against an overstuffed sofa upholstered in
brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a sleeping big red soldier felo kitten
on it, purring softly.
A red soldier felo marches in from the south.
A big green soldier felo kitten marches in from the south.
"I see," says Kim.
Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of a big green soldier felo kitten.
A big green soldier felo kitten purrs softly.
Kim says, "Well, fly safe."
'Thanks
"Thanks," you say.
"'thanks!" exclaims Lily. "We'll manage."
Lily says, "We were initially going out there the other time and planned to be
back but missed Hall of Pain so went onto Andy's and then to Tom Town and a
couple of other artifacting areas I know of."
Kim gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Oh, I did pass your
candidacy for the GSL position along to the liaison by the way, no word back
yet."
Lily says, "Ah thanks."
A red soldier felo marches out.
A big green soldier felo kitten marches out.
"As you know sometimes they are a little latent in their responses," Lily says.
"I have noticed," says Kim.
"I sent notes which they never responded to so I just took things in stride,"
Lily says.
"I sent them a message on monday and have not yet had a response," Kim says. "It
was not urgent though."
Lily nods.
Lily says, "I sent a query regarding Gray's Bold along with other information
and suggestions and never heard back."
"Well, fly safe, and see you in a few days," Kim says. "I really wouldn't like
either of you to miss the expedition. It's already very few AEU and mostly other
people."
A big red soldier felo bats at a small yellow ball containing some rattling
beads.
A hefty red soldier felo marches in from the south.
