15:24 That object was not found.

15:24 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

15:24 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

15:24 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid.

15:24 The starship is already moving.

15:24 You will once again see all starship movement messages. (Silent mode disengaged.)

15:25 You begin the landing sequence.

15:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward an asteroid.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off as the ship sets down on the asteroid's surface.

15:25 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:25 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

A scientist says, "I need the following items to complete the receiver. A small
box with holes in it and a single knob on the side, a small monopole magnet, a
thin triangular piece of metal, a misshapen mass of metal, a flexible piece of
wire, a flat heavy object with a series of buttons and knobs on it, a tiny metal
chip, a device flashing numerous alien symbols, a glowing metallic object with
two terminals on top, and a small piece of plastic with a series of bumps etched
on it. If you can put all of these in a container I will give you and return
here, and if you have at least 6500 license points, simply ask me again if you
can have a receiver. I'll sell you one in exchange for the items and fifty
million credits."

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa cover
