Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, Desiree the little black and
white spotted CatBot, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white
rattan coffee table with a glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and coral rocks, a
robotic chef named Nellie, an insulated orange cooler, Magellan the arachnoid
security robot, and an insulated purple cooler here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

Major Change:
Blast Furnace Overhaul!
For a long time it's been noted that the blast furnace is better than all other
power source options, and we agree! One big reason for that is that it recharges
a ship practically instantaneously, and that any debris can be used with equal
gains!
Well, no more! Debris now has a specific fusion value, where materials such as
hydrogen are far superior to materials such as iron or starship components,
whereas water is somewhere in the middle, so oort clouds and stellar nurseries
suddenly got a lot more appealing to visit!
Additionally, recharging now takes time after you finish shovelling debris, and
this is a much quicker process if the debris that has been salvaged is more
fusible. However, during the recharging period, your ship cannot enter the rift.
However, you can move normally in realspace during this time - the ship will be
rather vulnerable, but not completely helpless.
Finally, shovelling debris is now a continuous action, instead of one that you
have to mash as vigorously as possible. Also, we have added some additional
touches for realism.
Not to worry, the overall endurance from a blast furnace remains unchanged -
even if you're forced to use poorly fusible materials in a pinch, you'll get the
same overall range... but recharging stops will take much longer and you'll need
much more debris!
Note: Currently extant debris doesn't have its proper recharge value, this new
change only applies to newly-salvaged debris.
Someone comes in from the hub, takes a quick look around, and leaves again.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yup that's about right and you'd be able
to get there prior to when the emergency power is spent."
Several asteroid miners at a nearby table exchange stories about 'roid dogs,
laughing all the while.

rented, since I don't have a mod transport of my own. I need to do that

large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "Well I've now got a glowing
personality."

reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

The airlock hatch chimes quietly.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You'll have to take the rings
off then."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "No! No! No! I refuse!!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If they make you have a
glowing personality, then logic would dictate if you are wearing them, your
personality would be glowing...and if it isn't, then they are either
malfunctioning, or you should take them off because all the laws of physics have
been broken."
A medium-sized semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils
and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light
green sea fern.
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "You've got an exilent point. But
I shall wear them as long as they remain glowing."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "I'm actually thinking about
getting more of these."

too bright and everyone will have to wear shades."

yourself..."

Subject: New Exploration Book on the Market
Author: Morris Corlew
Posted: 06:25 16 October 2316 GST

Howdy, folks.
There is a new exploration book available on the market. Short version of the
story is that I had an encounter with someone in the rift, who dropped a journal
when she was startled by seeing me. Hold off on the jokes about my face, please.
I have painstakingly copied everything ftom said journal into a book with a
short explanation about what took place. It is available for sale on the space
market to even the poorest among you for only 1 single lonely credit.
Happy reading and explorering...I mean exploring.

Subject: Seeking Orange Egg & More
Author: Soraya Rhyz

I'm looking to buy an orange egg of any size, color, etc.
Also seeking to trade some dark purple eggs with red-skinned and violet maxwells
for any other color combos.
And lastly, giving away a large aquarium. It comes with a neon red light, plus
bubbler though the light color can probably be changed. Free to anyone who wants
to start raising their own fish.
Get in touch with me on comms, send mail or call me at 0002-33443 if you're
interested in any of the above, thanks!

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
