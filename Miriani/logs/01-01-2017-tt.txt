This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket, and
a pair of tan suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed
prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net
around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.
