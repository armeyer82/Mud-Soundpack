There should be a way to see a list of all the people who have keys to your ships in order to invalidate them or to see if they have a key already.

Ah, but indeed, there is such a list! If you go to your friendly neighborhood starship store, and use the invalidate command with the name of the ship in question, it will allow you to see all the keys in existence. There may be an easier way, but this has always been the method I use.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

Soundpack Hooks
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Miriani provides a number of useful out-of-band hooks that soundpack creators can use to enhance their soundpacks. Typically these hooks will provide information to the soundpack that could not ordinarily be gleaned from triggers alone. This help file will explain how to create a soundpack that can communicate with the MOO and will document the available hooks.

NOTE: You may need to view this section on the website, as it contains text that may be interpreted by your client as out-of-band commands and hidden from view. The URL is: http://toastsoft.net:1111/help2/Soundpack%20Hooks

  Soundpack Creation
First, your soundpack must be registered with the game in the soundpack registry. This allows the game to know who is using which soundpack and also allows other players to locate your soundpack. The following commands will be useful in the creation process:

@register-soundpack: This will ask you some questions about the name, version, clients, website, and download URL for your soundpack. This is step one!

@update-soundpack: This will update the version and, if necessary, download link to your soundpack. Once you execute this command, an update announcement will be sent to any connected users of your soundpack.

@soundpacks: Provides a list of soundpacks for your perusal.

  Soundpack Negotiation
When a player connects to Miriani, your soundpack will need to send a command in the following format:

Request: #$#register_soundpack <Soundpack Name> | <Soundpack Version>
Example: #$#register_soundpack Not Real | 10.9.8

The MOO will respond with a message in the format:

Response: #$#soundpack status <ok | outdated | unknown>
Example: #$#soundpack status ok

Ok means everything is good to go. Outdated means that your version of the soundpack doesn't match that of the MOO. The MOO will give you a warning and a download link. With both of these cases, a flag is set on your character and you will receive the special soundpack notifications. However, if it says unknown, this means your soundpack wasn't found in the registry and nothing has happened.

Alternatively, if you wish to register your soundpack BEFORE login, you can have it send the registration command at the username prompt BEFORE the user types their username. For example:

Username:
>register_soundpack Not Real | 1.0
>albori
Password:
>mypassword

  Soundpack Hooks
Message: #$#soundpack environment starship <space | landed> | <powered | unpowered> | <hostile | safe> | <light | dark> | <indoors | outdoors>
Example: #$#soundpack environment starship space | powered | safe | light | indoors
This indicates that the player is in a starship, in space, powered, in a safe environment with plenty of light. Indoors is included for completeness.

Message: #$#soundpack environment planet <classification> | <hostile | safe> | <light | dark> | <indoors | outdoors>
Example: #$#soundpack environment planet terrestrial | safe | light | outdoors

Message: #$#soundpack environment room <hostile | safe> | <light | dark> | <indoors | outdoors>
Example: #$#soundpack room safe | light | outdoors

Message: #$#soundpack social | [social name] | [person's gender]
Example: #$#soundpack social | grin | male

Message: #$#soundpack emote | [person's gender] | [emote with quoted substrings removed]
Example: #$#soundpack emote | male | Albori sighs wistfully and says while plunging a block of cheese into the trash.

Message: #$#soundpack environment space | <hostile> | <light | dark>
Example: #$#soundpack environment space | hostile | dark
Indicates you're in space. Obviously it's always going to list as hostile and outdoors, but it shows for completeness.

Message: #$#soundpack environment station | <hostile | safe> | <light | dark> | <indoors | outdoors>
Example: #$#soundpack environment station safe | light | indoors
Indicates you're on a space station, as I'm sure you guessed. For evident reasons, space stations will always display as indoors.

Message: #$#soundpack environment vehicle <landed | atmosphere> | <planet classification | starship | asteroid>
Example: #$#soundpack environment vehicle landed | starship
If you're in a vehicle, indicate whether it's landed or in an atmosphere. If you're in the atmosphere, indicate the classification of the planet. If you're docked, indicate starship. If you're in a rover, (hopefully) indicate asteroid.

Request: #$#soundpack_version_query <soundpack name>
Response: #$#soundpack status <ok | outdated | unknown> | version <version>
Example: #$#soundpack status ok | version 5.3
This will return the last reported version from the user as well as whether or not it's ok, unknown, or outdated. If the user isn't using the soundpack given in <soundpack name> then "unknown" will be returned with no version.

Request: #$#soundpack_ping
Response: #$#soundpack_pong
This command is typically used to test latency between client and server. Sending it will not alter idle time and can also help with poor connections, on top of the keep-alive system. See also: #$#soundpack_ping_reply

Request: #$#soundpack_ping_reply <optional ms>
Response: #$#soundpack_lag <time in seconds or milliseconds>
Example: #$#soundpack_lag 0.1068115234375
After receipt of a pong, this command can be used to reply, giving the game necessary data to calculate command latency. You can execute a ping sequence multiple times to obtain an average client-side. Including the ms argument will cause times to be displayed in milliseconds, rather than seconds.

Request: #$#unregister_soundpack
Unceremoniously unsets the soundpack flag on the player. Like a friend when you need to borrow money, there is no 
04:15 response.

  Conclusion
That should be everything you need to get started linking a soundpack to the game. If you have any questions, comments, bugs, or suggestions, please REPORT them or contribute to the message board thread mentioned below.

The original suggestion thread, which may contain additional information or insight, can be found by board reference 53586. Users of the web board can find it here: http://toastsoft.net:1111/board/OOC/Suggestions~Ideas/thread/53586

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa cover

04:28 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

04:28 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

04:28 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

04:28 The computer announces, "Scans reveal the debris to be a mass of magnesium silicates."

04:28 You hear a thunk as a piece of debris is expelled from the ship's cargo hold.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too
