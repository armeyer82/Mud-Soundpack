[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

Hi Love, I'm writing this because I may forget to ask? The current Salvage
processor in 777 will go offline around 2245 on 12-25-2316. Unfortunately, I
won't be available from around 2000 on this date until approximately 0200 on
12-26-2316. Will most likely have the station ready to deploy from Herding Cats
though. If you're available and can deploy the replacement in Asteroid Alpha 285
around the time the current one goes offline, it would be a tremendous help.
Otherwise, I'm sure that it won't cause much of an inconvenience to others if
the new Salvage processor is delayed for a few hours. Thanks for anything you
can do to assist. Love you, - Lily

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The motion of the ship throws your body from side to side, but your seatbelt
holds you in place.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
Z,1+u1x#OoP*1dvO{L$11YbWi-Fb'g(|m!m8Yxt(
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Hi Love, I'm writing this because I may forget to ask? The current Salvage
processor in 777 will go offline around 2245 on 12-25-2316. Unfortunately, I
won't be available from around 2000 on this date until approximately 0200 on
12-26-2316. Will most likely have the station ready to deploy from Herding Cats
though. If you're available and can deploy the replacement in Asteroid Alpha 285
around the time the current one goes offline, it would be a tremendous help.
Otherwise, I'm sure that it won't cause much of an inconvenience to others if
the new Salvage processor is delayed for a few hours. Thanks for anything you
can do to assist. Love you, - Lily

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
