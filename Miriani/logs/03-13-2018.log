The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

07:11 You hear the distinct hiss of water being pumped through the ship's piping. Moments later, a flurry of frozen water crystals begins to drift down from vents in the ceiling, lazily swirling through currents of air being pumped out until it settles on the deck plating, where it immediately melts into a hazardous water puddle.

08:27 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

13:53 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

18:05 [ You shatter immersion and say, "Need to go for a bit." ]

18:05 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid.

18:06 You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward an asteroid.

18:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off as the ship sets down on the asteroid's surface.

18:06 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

18:06 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

20:45 [Newbie] Cara West: There's no combat mission that you need an asteroid hauler for...

20:45 [Newbie] Allen Robinson: Cargo hauler maybe?

20:45 [Newbie] Anara Webster: She may be using it to move a fighter.

20:45 [Newbie] Silvia Baker: I got rid of my cargo hauler do you use that for missioning?

20:45 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: You don't use any hauller for a mission, if you hear something in game, its best for you to do your own research and make sure what your being told is true.

20:46 #$#soundpack_pong

20:46 #$#soundpack_lag 105

20:46 [Newbie] Cara West: That's not a hauler. If you're trying to move a fighter get a freighter or carrier or well a ship with a docking bay.

20:46 [Newbie] Silvia Baker: I am trying to figure out how to run a mission.

20:46 [Newbie] Daniel Smith: Ask that ic.

20:46 [Newbie] Daniel Smith: As this is the newbie channel for asking ooc questions afterall.

20:47 #$#soundpack_pong

20:47 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: You just ask it?

20:48 #$#soundpack_pong

20:48 #$#soundpack_lag 106

20:48 [Newbie] Cara West: Get a fighter or any ship with good weapons. Fighter, vanguard, cruiser, destroyer just to name a few. Upgrade it and then call over general for mission spots. Accept the fighter. When you've got mission crew go to High Guard on rolu assign the mission and try to see if you can get crew. Then launch fly through mission gate in sector 12.

20:48 [Newbie] Tom Tucker: Help combat missions. ...

20:49 #$#soundpack_pong

20:51 [Newbie] Daniel Smith: Ask ic, please.

20:51 [Newbie] Cara West: Fighters are meant for you to solo easy missions in. Vanguards and cruisers can hold 2 or 3 people for easies. Destroyers can hold 6 for mods. Gunships can hold 8 for diffs.

21:05 #$#soundpack_lag 115

21:05 [Newbie] Silvia Baker: Yes.

21:05 [Newbie] Daniel Smith: You can put different upgrades on. I.E. Rel drive etc.

21:05 [Newbie] Anara Webster: I'm not sure I understand the question.

21:05 [Newbie] Cara West: If you have a lore computer you can view the upgrades. And the cost of the upgrades.

21:05 [Newbie] Daniel Smith: Perhaps the general or chatter channels might be a better place to discuss this, as that way more people can add their input.

21:08 #$#soundpack_lag 116

21:08 [Newbie] Anara Webster: And, it being a cruiser you'll need two people with you.

21:08 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: Three at the maximum.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.
22:18  You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.
