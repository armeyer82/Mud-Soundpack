Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see Shamaya Iazikiwe (sitting on the floor) here.

01:25 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:25 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:25 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:25 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:25 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a sleeveless gold lace tank top with a sheer lavender mesh shawl thrown over it over a pale pink satin triangle bra with a gold heart-shaped front clasp. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of soft lavender purple linen capris with sun shaped pearls on the back pockets over a pair of pale pink satin boy shorts. She is wearing a pair of white platform sandals on her feet. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist.

16:23 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."

16:23 The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:24 #$#soundpack_lag 101

16:24 You press a large yellow button.

16:24 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

16:24 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Critical Strike" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

16:24 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:24 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:24 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:24 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The ten-person battlecruiser "Immortal Salvation" has left the sector.

16:24 The ship must be in space to do that.

16:24 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:24 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

16:24 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:24 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:24 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:24 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

16:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Critical Strike" has launched from Rolukssica.

16:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:41 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:41 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:41 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:41 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Critical Strike" has initiated an intrasector slip.

16:41 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:41 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:41 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:41 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

16:41 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:41 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

16:41 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:41 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.
