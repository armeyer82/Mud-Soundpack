00:04:37 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

00:04:38 Evenia Callseah opens the door.

00:04:38 Evenia Callseah just went out.

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:05:39 You sit down.

00:05:39 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

00:05:41 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:05:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:05:43 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:05:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:05:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:05:51 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Small Wonder" has jumped out of the sector.

00:05:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:06:04 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:06:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:06:05 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:06:08 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:06:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:06:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:06:12 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:06:12 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:06:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:06:16 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Weekend Warrior" has jumped into the sector.

00:06:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:06:17 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:06:19 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Shooting Star! Welcome to home space!"

00:06:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:06:42 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:06:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Shooting Star. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:06:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:06:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:08:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

00:21:18 You can't go that way.

00:21:22 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:21:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:21:24 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:21:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Praying Mantis, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:21:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:21:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:21:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Capital Ship Drydock. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:21:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:21:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

00:21:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:21:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:21:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:21:50 A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:21:52 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Shipyards."

00:21:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:21:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:21:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:21:56 The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the stations would be all but glowing with waste heat as the Intersector Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and darkened, and the ISC is no more.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:21:56 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Capital Ship Drydock."

00:21:57 You sit down on a gray leather captain's chair.

00:21:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:21:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:22:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:22:01 A large frame hangs in space here, sufficiently large to at least contain a battlecruiser-class starship.

00:22:03 Via general sector communication, Shipyard Structure transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Praying Mantis.' Welcome to Capital Ship Drydock."

00:22:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Shipyard Structure.

00:22:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:22:34 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:22:34 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:22:39 The computer receives no response, and begins docking procedures.

00:22:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:22:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:22:52 You stand up from a gray leather captain's chair.

00:22:53 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Airlock]

00:22:53 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:22:54 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

00:22:56 The computer announces, "Person detected without complete spacesuit. Cycling will not proceed."

00:22:57 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

00:22:57 [Enter `yes' or `no']

00:22:57 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

00:22:59 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

00:23:01 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

00:23:04 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

00:23:09 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

00:23:11 You exit the ship.

00:23:11 [Shipyard Structure; Docking Bay]

00:24:23 [Shipyard Structure; Aft Frame Assembly]

00:24:24 You can go southeast and southwest.
You are weightless here.

00:24:25 [Shipyard Structure; Port Frame Assembly]

00:24:25 You see a spacesuited figure here.
You can go southwest and northwest.
You are weightless here.

00:24:45 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."

00:24:47 [Shipyard Structure; Forward Frame Assembly]

00:24:47 You can go northeast, south, northwest, and down.
You are weightless here.

00:24:48 [Shipyard Structure; Docking Bay]

00:24:48 The exploration vessel "Percival Lowell", the one-person cargo hauler "Nation", the one-person cargo hauler "Supernova20", and the five-person gunship "Praying Mantis" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north.
You are weightless here.

00:24:50 Board what?

00:24:53 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Airlock]

00:24:53 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:24:54 You may not leave the airlock until its environment matches that of the ship.

00:24:55 I don't understand that.

00:24:56 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

00:24:59 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

00:25:00 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

00:25:05 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

00:25:07 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

00:25:09 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]

00:25:09 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a gray leather captain's chair, and a large leather couch here.
You can go south and out.

00:25:10 You begin the launch sequence.

00:25:15 The computer locates a launch trajectory.

00:25:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:25:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:25:26 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:25:26 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:25:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:25:29 You sit down on a gray leather captain's chair.

00:25:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:25:30 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]

00:25:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a gray leather captain's chair, and a large leather couch here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a gray leather captain's chair.)

00:25:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:25:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:25:33 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:25:34 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:25:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:25:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:25:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey Ather."

00:25:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:25:41 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Praying Mantis! Welcome to home space!"

00:25:58 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

00:25:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

00:26:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:26:06 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Melinda! There are totally parts here!"

00:26:27 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Only unmanned modules, but I just restocked those."

00:26:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:26:28 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:26:31 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Hell| Me-inda."

00:26:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Praying Mantis. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:26:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes, there are some. I didn't notice some of the wormhole modules."

00:26:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:26:48 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:26:54 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:26:54 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:26:59 You scramble to your feet.

00:26:59 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Airlock]

00:27:44 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

00:27:54 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:28:10 [General Communication] Xenolinguist Keegan Wantz transmits, "Oh, same as the normal mod transport, just has the gigantic bay for in-ship construction?"

00:28:16 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yup."

00:28:20 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Engineering Room]

00:28:20 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

01:43:49 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the airlock.

01:44:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami

01:47:34 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

01:47:50 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches out.

01:47:53 Lily Kaise says, "Well I don't always go after things unless I need something."

01:48:04 You say, "Well, we could see if there is enough interest to do missions."

01:48:09 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah!"

01:48:14 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "No one else?"

01:48:14 Lily Kaise says, "I do have time."

02:20:48 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid Belt Management Station.

02:20:48 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Gut I can always pay now t too!"

02:20:50 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

02:20:51 Lily Kaise says, "But."

02:20:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:20:56 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:21:01 You grin.

02:21:02 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:21:02 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:21:07 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Hi."

02:21:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:21:10 You begin the docking sequence.

02:21:10  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim Sahara sand linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
You are carrying nothing.

02:21:12 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:21:13 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:21:13 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and Xavier the old sleeping big silver soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go enter into the ship.

02:21:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

02:21:23 You say, "Aww."

02:21:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:21:25 You stroke the soft fur of Xavier the old sleeping big silver soldier felo.

02:21:26 Xavier the old sleeping big silver soldier felo takes a deep breath, then promptly continues to sleep.

02:21:30 You exit the ship.

02:21:31 [Asteroid Belt Management Station]
The four-person mule "Liberator", the scout "Pathseeker", the vostok-class capsule "Bolt", and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are parked here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go nowhere.

02:22:15 Some lights on the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" flash as Lily Kaise boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

02:22:22 Invalid selection.

02:22:26 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hi Alko."

02:22:31 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Also hi alko."

02:22:31 Board what?

02:22:33 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:22:34 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and Xavier the old sleeping big silver soldier felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:22:38 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:22:38 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

02:22:42 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Asteroid Belt Management Station.

02:22:46 I can't find "sofa."

02:22:48 I can't find "sofa."

02:22:50 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:22:57 You say to Lily Kaise, "Need to go anywhere else?"

02:23:05 Lily Kaise says, "Nope."

02:23:07 Lily Kaise grins.

02:23:09 You say, "Ok."

02:23:10 You grin.

02:23:11 You begin the launch sequence.

02:23:16 A launch trajectory is located.

02:23:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:23:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:23:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:23:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:23:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:23:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:23:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:23:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:23:39 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:23:39 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:23:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:23:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:23:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:23:43 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:23:46 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

02:23:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:24:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:24:24 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:24:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:24:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:24:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:24:47 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:24:47 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:24:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:24:50 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

02:24:54 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:25:00 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:25:19 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:26:23 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

02:26:31 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

02:37:39 She appears to be 30 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has light brown skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and firm calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is heart-shaped and quite pretty, with a button nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are pouty and pinkish red and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and squinting. Her mid-back length, thick hair is dark honey brown and in a bun. She has long rosy fingernails. She has a small birthmark on her neck.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
 She is wearing a classic misty rose silk sheath, an exquisite gold watch with sapphire accents, and a pair of rose pink patent leather stilettos. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a small cloth sack, a small matching sequined purse, a flight control scanner, a metachannel FTL communicator, a shimmering coral pink silk backpack, and a mood ring. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, left wrist, both hands, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying a photo of Keyonna Bradley in a glitter frame in her right hand.

02:37:39 Keyonna Bradley says, "I was wondering the same."

02:37:41 Rogue Romano says, "No clue."

02:37:50 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

02:37:57 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

02:38:06 You say to Keyonna, "Hi, I'm Shule. Nice to meet you."

02:38:08 Erik Goodwin considers a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural pistachio juice thoughtfully.

02:38:17 Erik Goodwin says, "According to the label it's the pride of the new earth lounge."

02:38:23 Keyonna Bradley smiles.

02:38:32 Keyonna Bradley exclaims, "Nice to meet you Shule!"

02:38:37 Keyonna Bradley smiles.

02:38:40 You grin.

02:38:43 Erik twists the cap off a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural pistachio juice and sniffs it hesitantly.

02:38:50 Bryan Stout grins and gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:38:50 A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the steaming beverage.

02:39:02 Erik Goodwin takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural pistachio juice.

02:39:05 Erik Goodwin gags.

02:39:05 Bryan stretches and absently hits a button, grabbing a turnover.

02:39:07 Erik Goodwin says, "God."

02:39:15 Erik Goodwin says, "Yeah no not for me."

02:39:17 Nathaniel says to Erik, "You suddenly just reminded me for no random reason how much I wanted a glass of beer about 20 minutes ago."

02:39:17 Bryan Stout orders a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

02:39:23 Rogue Romano laughs.

02:39:25 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:39:25 Keyonna Bradley smiles.

02:39:28 You chuckle.

02:39:32 Erik says to Nathaniel, "That's an insult to beer."

02:39:35 Erik Goodwin grins.

02:39:35 Rogue Romano finishes off a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

02:39:39 You say to Lily, "We taking my cruiser or the org one?"

02:39:44 Rogue Romano puts a mug in a shiny chrome trash bin.

02:39:45 Erik Goodwin puts a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural pistachio juice in a shiny chrome trash bin.

02:39:54 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

02:39:54 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Jacob is everything ok there? Are you still joining us?"

02:39:59 Nathaniel says to Erik, "Would take away the taste of that stuff."

02:40:03 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Yes mam, about to land."

02:40:08 Erik Goodwin says, "Good point."

02:40:10 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

02:40:10 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Awesome!"

02:40:13 Erik Goodwin says, "Although it would involve walking."

02:40:19 Erik Goodwin says, "So I'll just stick to this pastry."

02:40:21 Erik Goodwin takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with apple cinnamon filling.

02:40:26 You say to Lily, "Do you want us to take my cruiser or the org cruiser?"

02:40:28 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I was dealing with my felo really quick and was distracted a moment. I do apologize."

02:40:34 Bryan says to you, "Yours."

02:40:35 Lily Kaise says, "Our org Crusier."

02:40:35 Nathaniel Owens says, "Worth it though. Don't want to be gunning drunk. God know what i'd end up doing."
Bryan Stout laughs.

02:40:36 Rogue Romano orders a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural raspberry juice.

02:40:39 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person light transport "A Dime At A Time" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:40:40 Lily Kaise says, "Sruiser."

02:40:45 Jacob Smitt just arrived.

02:40:45 Lily Kaise says, "Haha I can't talk either."

02:40:48 You laugh.

02:40:50 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

02:40:51 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:40:52 Bryan Stout orders a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

02:40:54 Bryan Stout takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

02:40:59 Lily Kaise says, "I want to see how wicked the lasers are."

02:41:01 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural raspberry juice.

02:41:04 Erik Goodwin says, "What are AEU cruisers like anyways."

02:41:13 Rogue Romano says, "No clue."

02:41:14 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ou are atout to find out!"

02:41:14 Bryan Stout asks, "Your cruiser has lasers doesn't it shule?"

02:41:15 Nathaniel says to Lily, "Welcomme to the club of the none-talking talkers. We hope you enjoy your stay with us."

02:41:16 Jacob Smitt orders a flaky iced pastry with blueberry filling.

02:41:17 You say to Lily, "Ok, just remember. I haven't flown a mission in forever!"

02:41:20 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:41:20 Rogue Romano asks, "Energy hogs?"

02:41:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:41:26 Erik Goodwin finishes off a flaky iced pastry with apple cinnamon filling.

02:41:27 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Of courese!"

02:41:27 Keyonna Bradley smiles.

02:41:30 Lily Kaise says, "Course."

02:41:39 Bryan Stout asks, "What's the layout of it again?"

02:41:47 Erik Goodwin says, "Lots of lasers I'd imagine."

02:41:50 Rogue Romano orders a piping hot turnover filled with meatball.

02:41:51 Bryan Stout chuckles.

02:41:51 Erik Goodwin says, "Like just loads."

02:41:58 Rogue Romano takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with meatball.

02:42:02 You say, "Lasers and minis in every room except 5 and 6. Where it's just lasers."

02:42:05 Erik Goodwin asks, "Maybe a few sad minicannons?"

02:42:06 Bryan Stout says, "Woo."

02:42:15 Lily Kaise says, "No 5 and 6 only have lasers."

02:42:22 You say, "That's what I said."

02:42:24 You grin.

02:42:24 Bryan Stout asks, "Both cruisers outfitted the same?"

02:42:35 You say to Bryan, "The org cruiser has a laser plant."

02:42:36 Rogue Romano says, "Oh, I want one them rooms them."

02:42:39 Bryan Stout says, "Oof."

02:42:41 Lily Kaise says, "No because I put the laser plant on the Org cruiser."

02:42:42 Jacob Smitt takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with blueberry filling.

02:42:42 Rogue Romano says, "Then."

02:42:45 Bryan Stout exclaims, "Sexy!"

02:42:46 Erik Goodwin says, "Dibs on 5."

02:42:50 You grin.

02:42:50 Bryan Stout says, "Dibs on 6."

02:42:50 Rogue Romano says, "Six."

02:42:51 Bryan Stout laughs.

02:42:58 Lily Kaise says, "These lasers are 132 percent."

02:43:00 Keyonna Bradley says, "I'm new to this so, bare with me."

02:43:01 Erik Goodwin chortles.

02:43:02 Keyonna Bradley smiles.

02:43:06 Bryan says to Keyonna, "You'll do great!"

02:43:06 Nathaniel Owens says, "Nice."

02:43:09 Erik Goodwin smiles at Keyonna Bradley.

02:43:10 You say to Keyonna, "You'll be fine."

02:43:12 Lily Kaise nods.

02:43:13 Keyonna Bradley smiles.

02:43:23 Erik says to Keyonna, "Yeah, what they said, you'll do just fine."

02:43:30 Lily Kaise asks, "So I think everyone is here?"

02:43:30 You say, "Just remember to shoot chainguns."

02:43:34 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:43:36 Keyonna Bradley nods.

02:43:37 Erik Goodwin says, "Yes and torpedos."

02:43:39 Erik Goodwin says, "All the torpedos."

02:43:42 You say, "Yep."

02:43:44 Erik says to Keyonna, "They're just messing with you."

02:43:48 Rogue Romano says, "Right, reload reload reload."

02:43:49 Erik says to Keyonna, "It's lasers this time."

02:43:50 Bryan Stout grins at Keyonna Bradley.

02:43:54 Keyonna Bradley smiles.

02:43:56 You grin at Keyonna Bradley.

02:43:58 Keyonna Bradley says, "Oh."

02:43:58 Lily Kaise says, "All lasers all the way nothing else."

02:44:00 Keyonna Bradley laughs.

02:44:03 Bryan says to Keyonna, "Minicannons and lasers. Both weapons don't need to be reloaded either."

02:44:11 You say, "Unless the captain calls for something different."

02:44:15 Keyonna Bradley says, "I was sitting here like, torpedos, don't forget to shoot torpedos."

02:44:18 Keyonna Bradley laughs.

02:44:20 Lily Kaise says, "We don't use minis on our ships unless all of the lasers are totally gone."

02:44:25 Keyonna Bradley nods.

02:44:26 Nathaniel says to Keyonna, "My advice would be just focus on what your doing and tune everyone else out, like, just zone out of all the other sounds and stuff."

02:44:28 Top Gun Erik Goodwin says, "Fire all the torpedos."

02:44:33 Bryan says to Keyonna, "I'll teach ya things while we fly to the missions."

02:44:34 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:44:37 Keyonna Bradley nods.

02:44:45 Keyonna Bradley asks, "Is it the same as beacons?"

02:44:48 Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.

02:44:50 Jacob Smitt nods.

02:44:52 You say to Erik, "We'll launch you out like a torpedo."

02:44:53 Top Gun Erik Goodwin says, "Pretty much."

02:44:56 Jacob Smitt says, "Pretty much."

02:44:57 Nathaniel Owens says, "Similar, yes. Longer, though."

02:44:57 Jacob Smitt nods.

02:45:03 Erik Goodwin says to you, "I'm actually fine with that bro."

02:45:09 Erik Goodwin says to you, "I've always wanted to experement."

02:45:13 You chuckle.

02:45:20 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "People hanging out at New Earth? How odd."

02:45:20 Rogue Romano takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with meatball.

02:45:21 Erik Goodwin says, OOCly, "Experiment*."

02:45:27 Erik Goodwin speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

02:45:27 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Not for long."

02:45:29 You say, "Don't thold jacob."

02:45:33 You hold Jacob Smitt's hand, taking him into your group.

02:45:35 You say, "Sorry."

02:45:39 You say, "Let's do this thing."

02:45:41 Jacob Smitt says, "Well the only difference I have seen is it is like two beacons or three in a row. Because they come in waves."

02:45:41 Nathaniel says to Erik, "Somehow, I doubt you'f find it quite so fun when your flying through space."

02:45:49 You say, "Now, do not leave the control room."

02:45:54 Jacob Smitt says, "But other than that, its basicly the same."

02:45:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They've decided that it's the better earth."

02:45:55 Lily Kaise says, "Everyone stay in the control room until mission is assigned."

02:46:01 Bryan Stout says, "No."

02:46:03 You say, "Let me r reeat. Do not leave the control room."

02:46:04 Bryan Stout says, "Go 1 south."

02:46:06 Erik says to Nathaniel, "But imagine the headline. Fringe voice fires league whip at new earth."

02:46:13 You chuckle at Bryan Stout.

02:46:15 Lily Kaise says, "Oh'oh true."

02:46:17 You can't go that way.

02:46:19 You're already standing.

02:46:21 Bryan says to you, "Take everyone south, get erik to grab everyone so we don't get tons of roundtime."

02:46:28 Bryan Stout says, "Er, well."

02:46:31 Lily Kaise says, "Well I could."

02:46:32 You say, "Oh, ok."

02:46:34 Bryan Stout says, "Not tripping over each other and shit."

02:46:36 Jacob Smitt nods.

02:46:39 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I would laugh at joke, but it is bad joke."

02:46:42 You say to Lily, "Bring everyone south."

02:46:46 Nathaniel Owens says, "And my reason? That reload button was to far to reach, so a crew member will have to do."

02:46:47 Bryan Stout gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:46:49 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ok I don't have all morning!"

02:46:50 Erik Goodwin says, "The easiest way is to have someone else move everyone along, it gets elss confusing."

02:46:51 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

02:46:51 You can go up.
Lily Kaise, Bryan Stout, Nathaniel Owens, Erik Goodwin, Rogue Romano, Keyonna Bradley, and Jacob Smitt followed you.

Muffin the little orange CatBot trots happily in after Rogue Romano with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:47:11 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:47:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:47:12 Erik Goodwin leaves your group.

02:47:13 Erik Goodwin takes control of your group.

02:47:15 Bryan Stout says, "One moment."

02:47:18 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "All is right in the universe."

02:47:20 Erik Goodwin says to you, "Now you can fly in peace."

02:47:21 Bryan Stout ambles northwest.

02:47:24 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]

02:47:25 You see a viral injection pylon launcher, a decoy beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

02:47:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:47:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Raging Seas, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:47:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:47:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:47:45 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:47:45 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:47:47 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

02:47:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:47:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:47:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:47:53 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:47:54 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:47:59 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

02:47:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:48:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:48:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:48:03 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:48:03 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

02:48:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:48:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:48:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:48:08 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:48:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:48:28 Erik Goodwin's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh no you have to go back."

02:48:30 Erik Goodwin's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You forgot ammo."

02:48:36 You chuckle into the PA microphone.

02:48:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:48:48 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:48:52 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

02:48:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:49:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:49:06 Erik Goodwin meanders in from the south followed by Lily Kaise, Nathaniel Owens, Rogue Romano, Keyonna Bradley, Jacob Smitt, and Bryan Stout.

02:49:07 Muffin the little orange CatBot trots happily in after Rogue Romano with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:50:53 Nathaniel Owens strides south.

02:50:57 Erik Goodwin's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I still want a refund! I could have bought a coffee for those 5 credits."

02:50:59 Jacob Smitt's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "WR 3 Standing by, Sir."

02:50:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:51:06 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sorry we don't have any furniture in here just yet."

02:51:13 Keyonna Bradley sits down.

02:51:37 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]

02:51:37 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a viral injection pylon launcher, a decoy beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.

03:50:34 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Control Room]

03:50:35 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

03:57:18 You say, "Oh."

03:57:20 You say, "I forgot."

03:57:22 You say, "Ok."

03:57:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:57:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Raging Seas, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:57:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:57:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:57:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:57:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:57:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

03:57:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:57:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:57:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:57:49 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: |Us"S|BwPisPT$|`TLuO=/:|_X.w~)B[37.rq]LQ
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

03:57:54 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:57:55 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

03:57:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:57:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:57:59 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:58:00 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

04:06:09 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

04:34:32 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

06:23:15 [Starship "Revenge"; Control Room]

06:23:15 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.

06:26:56 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.

06:33:18 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

06:33:18 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

06:33:19 You sit down.

06:33:20 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

06:33:20 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

06:33:21 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

06:33:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:33:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

06:33:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:33:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:33:39 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:33:39 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:33:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

06:33:43 You're already sitting.

06:33:43 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:33:43 The motion of the ship throws your body from side to side, but your seatbelt holds you in place.

06:33:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:33:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:33:46 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:33:47 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

06:33:48 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:33:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:33:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:33:51 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:33:54 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Shooting Star! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

06:33:55 AutoStar detects 5 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

06:33:56 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

06:33:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:34:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:34:06 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

06:34:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Shooting Star. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

06:34:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

06:34:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

06:34:26 You pull a large lever towards you.

06:34:26 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

06:34:26 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

06:34:27 You scramble to your feet.

06:34:27 You exit the capsule.

As soon as you board the pod, it launches from the station, beginning a long arc above the surface.

06:36:59 [Suborbital Pod: Chetumal City to Ixtapa]

06:37:00 Several rows of cramped seats are arranged along the walls of the pod, facing toward the axis. It's obvious that the pod was built for capacity rather than comfort.
You can go nowhere.

06:37:01 There appear to be 12 pilots recently active.

06:56:34 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:56:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

06:56:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:56:48 The ship is already moving.

06:56:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:56:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Calm. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:56:50 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:56:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

06:56:54 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:56:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:56:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:56:57 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

06:57:28 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:57:28 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

06:57:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Shooting Star. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

06:57:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

06:57:40 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I will not say what I'm thinking. I will not."

06:59:32 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

06:59:32 [General Communication] Bryan Stout whistles.

06:59:33 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:59:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:59:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:59:36 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:59:39 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Shooting Star! Welcome to home space!"

06:59:40 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Oh snap."

06:59:41 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "I always got time burnos."

06:59:43 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Whoa boy."

06:59:43 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "I mean vernos."

06:59:52 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Perhaps you can save me from this group over here."

06:59:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No, not at the moment. I have work to do."

07:00:02 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "No. No she can't. See?"

07:00:06 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

07:00:10 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Damn."

07:00:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

07:00:12 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

07:00:12 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well damn then."

07:00:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Shooting Star. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

07:00:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

07:00:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

07:00:28 You pull a large lever towards you.

07:00:28 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

07:00:29 You scramble to your feet.

07:00:29 You exit the capsule.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 541" and the vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" are landed here.

07:01:16 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They are being really creepy over here and was looking for help."

07:01:22 [General Communication] Bryan Stout whimpers.

07:01:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Vern, they're always really creepy."

07:01:29 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "How the f am I being creepy."

07:01:32 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

07:01:32 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

07:01:34 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Speak for yourself young man."

07:01:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

07:01:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

07:01:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

07:01:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

07:01:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

07:01:54 The ship is already moving.

07:01:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

07:01:55 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

07:01:55 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:01:56 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

07:01:57 You sit down.

07:01:57 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

07:01:59 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:02:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:02:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:02:02 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:02:03 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

07:02:04 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:02:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:02:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:02:08 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:02:08 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

07:02:09 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:02:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:02:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:02:13 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:02:14 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

07:02:14 Your communicator reports that...

07:02:14 
At least six recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.
[General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "My suggestion would be try asteroid mining."

07:02:15 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:02:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:02:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:02:18 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

07:02:20 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Shooting Star. Welcome to Accord space."

07:02:22 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Gag me."

07:02:23 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

07:02:24 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

07:02:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

07:02:27 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "I can't do that."

07:02:34 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

07:02:34 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

07:02:36 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Don't say that around me."

07:02:39 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

07:02:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

07:02:43 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Vern. Lesson one. Related to Joel and Bryan. If they aren't being either creepy. Strange. Or a measure of both. There's something wrong with them and they need medical attention."

07:02:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

07:02:52 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Speak for yourself young lady."

07:02:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

07:02:54 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

07:02:59 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Wow."

07:03:00 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Excuse me? You didn't say drop dead sexy."

07:03:11 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Which is why we love them."

07:03:15 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "She's jealous of my piercings."

07:03:21 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay, well I was hoping you would save me but I see I need to take matters into my own hands."

07:03:31 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "No no I'm leaving we're leaving right now."

07:03:38 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

07:03:39 This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face. It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however, possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
(You are sitting.)

07:03:54 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Play nice boys."

07:04:00 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Oh no no nooooo!"

07:04:02 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Either use both or swich regularly. Just trying to be helpful."

07:04:09 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Oh."

07:04:10 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I'm being abducted semi against my will."

07:04:19 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "I thought vernos was going to do something inappropriate."

07:04:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well. I wouldn't change either of them for anything. But yeah. That's Joel and Bryan."

07:04:27 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

07:04:28 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Not that I wouldn't."

07:04:29 [General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.

07:04:31 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Thought or hoped?"

07:04:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

07:04:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

07:04:41 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Shhh I won't say hoped."

07:04:58 You tap a number into a metallic gold touch einrophone.

07:04:58 You hear a soft ringing sound on the line.

07:05:02 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am escaping and hiding deep in a asteroid mining site."

07:05:03 You hear a soft ringing sound on the line.

07:05:08 You hear a soft ringing sound on the line.

07:05:12 The ringing stops as the other end is picked up.

07:05:15 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Hi you."

07:05:19 You say, "Hey you."

07:05:21 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Oh. If escaping is all you meant I could have taken you into, never mind."

07:05:49 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I know how to fly your ship."

07:05:49 You ask, "Hey, are you busy?"

07:06:00 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "That's hot."

07:06:06 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Did you have to use both hands?"

07:06:10 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Mmm. I like guys that know how to fly my ship."

07:06:17 [General Communication] Rogue Romano cackles!

07:06:27 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You can not see it but I regret the words I spoke."

07:06:30 Over the line, "I actually am." Evenia Callseah laughs. "I meant what I said to Vern. Though...Even if I wasn't. I wasn't getting anywhere near that. He's a cadet for one thing. and for another...I'm not interested."

07:06:35 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "What if I told you the next ship you fly will be a virgin?"

07:06:37 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I just got good with handling torps, and I leave the rest to the ships."

07:06:50 You chuckle. "Ok."

07:07:01 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Well hot damn."

07:07:01 You say, "No worries."

07:07:12 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yup, hiding away in a mining site."

07:07:15 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah ask, "Can you do me a favor, and hook him up with...Anyone? Anything?"

07:07:26 You laugh. "Wish me luck."

07:07:35 You say, "I suck at matchmaker."

07:07:38 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Oh, I'm wishing you all the luck."

07:07:59 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "I don't care who it is. The admiration is nice, but...creepy."

07:07:59 You chuckle.

07:08:07 You say, "Yeah, I hear ya."

07:08:23 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I forgot that's your tugboat."

07:08:24 You say, "I have no idea who to hook him up with at the moment."

07:08:46 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Quit tuggin' at my boat."

07:08:46 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "A lizard for all I care. Just get him paying attention to something else."

07:08:51 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Never."

07:09:00 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "You better."

07:09:03 You chuckle. "Hmmm, I'll see what I can do."

07:09:12 Over the line, Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:09:14 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I refuse to dignify this with any response other than this one."

07:09:20 You laugh.

07:09:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's a pretty undignified response right there."

07:09:30 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Thank you. But I'll catch you soon? I gotta get this stuff done."

07:09:49 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That is the point, I think."

07:09:56 You say, "I was going to see if you wanted to keep me company while I go put up the station out at 275, but you're busy. Next time maybe."

07:10:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Figured."

07:10:02 You say, "Er, 285."

07:10:16 You say, "Ok, catch you later."

07:10:19 You say, "Take care."

07:10:20 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Definitely next time. Count on it."

07:10:30 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "You have a point?"

07:10:31 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Anything I say will be twisted and warped into perversion."

07:10:42 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Shame on them."

07:10:44 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I got one, come here."

07:10:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Of course. You're in the civi corps."

07:10:59 You say, "Ok, take care."

07:11:05 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "You too."

07:11:08 The connection goes silent with a soft click.

07:12:57 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "My minicannon."

07:13:02 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Do not twist too hard. Bruising is possible."

07:13:18 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So is a sprain or even a break."

07:13:20 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "If you hear sharp crack, you have twisted too hard."

07:13:20 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Well you'll see when I land."

07:13:25 [General Communication] "It's like I said to Morris the other day." Evenia Callseah chortles. "Sometimes I gotta pretend I'm normal, to then remember how not normal I am."

07:14:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew whistles.

07:14:14 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

07:14:15 This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face. It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however, possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
(You are sitting.)

07:14:18 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "It's there for a reminder that I was there after all."

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

07:28:50 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

07:28:50 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go south and out.

07:28:52 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

07:28:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

07:28:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

07:28:54 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

07:28:59 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

07:28:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

07:29:01 I can't find "sofa."

07:29:03 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

07:29:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

Enter your selection:

07:29:11 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

07:29:12 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:29:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

07:29:16 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:29:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:29:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:29:19 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: "i`8;7H'WM3f`<1a/ll(U+D\|u9BIl1_9{0Zg<f~
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:29:20 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

07:29:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:29:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:29:24 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:29:25 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

07:29:26 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:29:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:29:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:29:29 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:29:30 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

07:29:37 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

07:29:42 This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 7,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do you wish to pay this?

07:29:42 [Enter `yes' or `no']

07:29:44 You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

07:29:44 The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

07:29:45 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

07:29:46 There are no other ships in the sector.

07:29:55 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

07:29:55 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

07:29:56 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

07:29:57 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

07:46:08 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

07:46:09 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

07:46:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "So what would it take for old frontier to open?"

07:46:19 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

07:46:19 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

07:46:20 The starship has left a unique area of space.

07:46:20 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

07:46:29 Listen. You need to be careful.

07:46:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We need to take battlesuits into it and fight the bari."

07:46:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Higher than my tier one I bet."

07:47:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, we usually like to have at least tier 2 or higher. If there are enough poeple, you might be able to come along in your tier 1."

07:47:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "People, that is."

07:47:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Maybe I will ask for help later."

07:48:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You could, but usually someone with a tier 3 or higher league suit needs to lead."

07:48:14 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

07:48:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We can try to organize something later."

07:48:48 The AEU reached all performance goals!

07:48:48 Top Performers: Kim Saunders, Shule Elemmire, and Lily Kaise.
The current Conquest period began 1 day, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 28 seconds ago. The period will end in 2 days, 18 hours, 11 minutes, and 12 seconds.

07:49:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will ask, who knows, maybe we can get what we need easy."

07:49:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's been like pulling teeth in the passed. There's not much reward for other alliances tohelp us."

07:49:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

07:50:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well, we will see later."

07:51:19 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

07:51:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Honestly, I would wait until someone who is experienced at it organizes it. Lily or Ather may be willing to lead it later."

07:51:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "1there ya go."

07:51:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah."

07:52:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You need specific suits. It's not like a nest."

07:54:19 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:54:19 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

07:54:21 Via general sector communication, AEU Passively Beaconed Fusion Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

07:54:28 I don't understand that ("e" is an ambiguous name).

07:54:31 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

07:54:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

07:54:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Maybe with a revitalized corps we can keep it open."

07:55:07 The starship transitions into another sector.

07:55:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That would be nice."

07:56:13 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

07:56:13 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

07:56:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

07:56:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

07:56:41 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

07:56:43 The computer reports that the two-person Accord corvette "Peacekeeper Task Force Mu 4" has jumped into the sector.

07:56:44 The computer reports that the two-person Accord corvette "Peacekeeper Task Force Alpha 2" has jumped into the sector.

07:56:45 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

07:56:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

07:56:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

07:56:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

07:56:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

07:56:59 You scramble to your feet.

07:56:59 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Airlock]
You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

07:57:02 You exit the ship.

You can go northeast, southeast, and up.
[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

07:57:04 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

07:57:04 This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face. It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however, possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.

07:57:06 You sit down.

07:57:06 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

07:57:07 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

07:57:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

07:57:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

07:57:09 There appear to be 12 pilots recently active.

07:57:13 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

07:57:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

07:57:22 The ship is already moving.

07:57:23 The ship is already moving.

07:57:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

07:57:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

07:57:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:57:26 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

07:57:33 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:57:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:57:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:57:36 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

07:57:37 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

07:57:38 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

07:57:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

07:57:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:57:41 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

07:57:44 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Shooting Star! Welcome to home space!"

08:13:47 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Why?"

08:15:15 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Can no longer calculate with it. Movement predictions are no good."

08:15:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "At least it lasted a good long while."

08:16:00 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Is that the one that you just made?"

08:28:45 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "What?"

08:28:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I neglected to have Mel get me an accelerator."

08:29:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But there's one on the Cats spare parts ship I can use."

08:30:36 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Remains of League 75th, 1.03 light-trade cycles down and slightly southwest from Capella."

08:30:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's the one we found, yes."

08:30:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Same distance from B-24 and that whole cluster pretty much."

08:38:46 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I think that is closest you are going to get."

08:39:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, and it's not much closer than the Fall of the New Earth 40th."

08:39:22 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "I guess see which one is better?"

08:39:30 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I found several locations that were just as close, or just slightly further."

08:39:38 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "But 1.03 light-trade cycles is closest."

08:39:54 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "For League location that is."

08:40:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well the grade is slightly lower at League 75th than at New Earth 40th."

08:40:26 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "What are they?"

08:40:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But it's...a light-year closer I think? Not much difference."

08:40:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...10 to 30 at the League one and 20 to 40 at the New Earth one."

08:41:01 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Gotcha. What's the 777 one?"

08:41:08 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Not much difference. Are you going to put accelerator up?"

08:41:56 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "It shows how much salvaging I do."

08:42:01 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Or work at all."

08:42:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's not much difference in the two so I'm not sure moving things around is that great an idea. But I'm thinking of maybe asking Lily if she wouldn't mind moving 776 from Mir to Battle of Mir. They're negligible distance and then we don't need a marker at Battle."

08:43:11 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "So what's wrong with 777?"

08:43:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We were just hoping to find something closer is all."

08:43:36 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "So lazy."

08:43:38 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Did you look out of Tesla?"

08:43:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. Has to do with new pilots and their batteries and how long it takes us to go help them if it's needed."

08:44:14 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Lazy."

08:44:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. There's several places we haven't looked out of yet."

08:44:18 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Tell them to get better batterys."

08:44:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How is helping new pilots lazy Aisling?"

08:44:59 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I am too lazy to come up with good answer."

08:47:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Technically it's not needed at all, but there's no tellin some folks that, so we're just tryin to maybe make it better if we can. But it's quite possible we won't find anything. However, we might just find something pretty neat besides what we're lookin for, so why not try?"

08:48:15 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Message Beacon in Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285.

09:36:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I just put 071 up without a stealth not thinkin about it."

09:36:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nothing special. Just the basic stealth. Sometimes I'll get a couple of outsiders, but usually only two."

09:36:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. I just got an ace corvette thrall without one. Is it the one that uses 1 power or 5?"

12:49:28 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "In fact, three."

12:49:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Barnham's Belt, Barnham's Redoubt, and..."

12:50:07 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Barnham's face."

12:50:10 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oh, hang on, maybe only two, I was thinking Territories but I might be making that one up."

12:50:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ali's face."

12:50:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Your face."

12:51:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyone happen to know there the one for Mutie folks is?"

12:51:42 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Their belt management station? Hmm, no, on the other side of some skim probably though."

12:51:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep, it does, I got my book out, I wasn't making it up."

12:52:27 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "No, I don't actually, that's a good question."

12:52:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, forgot about that one. I know all our stuff, I don't know y'all's. Never had the need."

12:52:49 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, well, isn't it usually where asteroids can be hauled and mined?"

12:52:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Heck, I didn't know ours till bein SDC and doin sector checks."

12:52:58 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Barnham's Territory isn't one we actually go to often."

12:53:16 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "They have a few hauling places by the looks of it."

12:53:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's a few of those in the Mutuality Kim. I might have to check 'em out and look unless one of them turns their comm on."

12:53:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, what Ted said."

12:53:31 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Which do they have?"

12:53:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Helios, Tandem, and I think somewhere else."

12:53:59 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have never seen a belt station near tandem."

12:54:01 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'd have to haul a roid to remember, but I know they have Helios, which doesn't have a belt station as far as I remember."

12:54:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Tandem accepts roids."

12:54:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, neither does Tandem."

12:54:43 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I don't remember ever noticing one, but then I wouldn't notice yours either."

12:54:59 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, wait. No, the roid place is not Helios station, but something with Helios in the name."

12:54:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

12:55:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, it's Helios Subsidiary Processor."

12:55:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But Tandem accepts roids at both docks alpha and beta."

12:55:51 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have never gone there. But uh. I think that they have only 3 places because you can take roids to tandem station alpha and beta."

12:56:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "To be honest, I'll look at what's there in a sector when I'm not sure, but once I know what I want, I tend to just go there, and forget everything else."

12:56:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

12:56:22 [General Communication] Kim Saunders laughs. "So the helios thingy might very well be their belt station, you'd have to go there to be sure."

12:56:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't know that that's a separate sector. Let me check something here."

12:57:01 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, I do believe that is a separate sector."

12:57:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh...uh...might be in Nebular Cluster?"

12:57:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd about be willin to bet that's where it's at."

12:58:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wanna make 1% of what you asked me for earlier?"

12:58:42 [General Communication] Morris whines. "But Kimmmmmm! I'm mining!"

12:58:46 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I know the EAOS one is in drifting cluster."

12:58:50 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

12:59:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ali asked me for a billion credits. I will pay him 1% of that to go check it out for me."

12:59:28 [General Communication] Kim Saunders laughs.

12:59:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Remember, I'm supposed to be learning laziness from Mel!"

13:00:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "There's nothing obvious but I bet you're right about where it is Morris."

13:00:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ali, do I have to do what Aisling does?"

13:00:37 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Waht, call him arse face?"

13:01:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "This is...bad."

13:01:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."

13:01:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Kim, would you rather make 1% of what Ali asked me for?"

13:01:48 [General Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.

13:01:57 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I guess you are hoping I wil go check this out."

13:02:06 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Why is this important?"

13:02:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wait, giggling is usually positive, right? Is that a yes? Please say it's a yes?"

13:02:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My booook."

13:02:18 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Your, book?"

13:02:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm."

13:03:01 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "All right then, I am not doing anything very important right now anyway."

13:03:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, some time ago I wrote a book for League pilots about industrial and other activities we do in our career. Because an interalliance version took a lot more work and research and I was busy with other endeavors, I didn't get to updating it to the new version till now."

13:03:58 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, what is this place I am checking out?"

13:04:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nebular Cluster out of the Cross."

13:04:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "See if there's a belt management station there. Either way I'll give ya 10 mill."

13:06:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hey, I'm thinking a hell of a long way ahead here, but can anyone tell me what the modules you can get for AEU 4 and Muty 4 are? It occured to me the other day that I've never noticed."

13:06:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Light is one of 'em for AEU."

13:07:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not sure if that's 4 or 5 though."

13:07:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've seen Mel use it before too."

13:07:46 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hey, I'm in my AEU and I want you to hit me, oh, wait, I don't take as much damage as the others."

13:07:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've got under 95 ground to go."

13:07:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hey, it has its uses."

13:08:06 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You're way ahead of me."

13:08:07 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "They're backups. Especially blind."

13:08:14 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

13:08:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And Ted, far as I know, we get the AEU at 1350. Not sure when y'all get it."

13:08:38 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Should be 1450 for us."

13:08:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "1400 as far as I know."

13:08:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ali tell me this is so? Please."

13:08:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh."

13:08:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...195 then."

13:09:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm still 90 off my League 4."

13:09:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ali, first you miss out on making 1% of what you asked for, now you dash my opes of my AEU 4."

13:09:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My hopes rather."

13:09:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You are not my friend anymore. I'm pouting, even though you can't see it."

13:09:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

13:09:43 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Morris, the answer is yet."

13:12:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. I ordered the pizza oven I was talkin about. Not sure when they'll get it to me since it's custom."

13:15:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ted do y'all have anywhere other than Barnham's for minin?"

13:16:47 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, has everyone made it home from uh, the oort place?"

13:16:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

13:17:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Goss checked all the stations."

13:17:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep Kim."

13:17:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We could use Drifting Clustre if we wanted, but the taxes make it not worthwhile."

13:17:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm."

13:18:33 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Even with taxes, drifting is still a bit more worth while than glittering. But not compared to frontier."

13:19:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Crias is the bomb."

13:19:12 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's nowhere near as good as Barnham's for us, I tried it a good few times."

13:19:56 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "We should try to clean frontier again some time."

13:26:52 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "For frontier, that is."

13:27:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I do, it has reps and sonics and chains."

13:27:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The couple times I've done it, damage wasn't all that bad."

13:29:23 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "How many of us does it need? I've never done it yet."

13:29:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I know it's not for you Ted...I was talkin specifically about myself."

13:30:15 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Actually, I'll be back in a bit."

14:14:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wow...that took awhile."

14:14:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Gotta remember to initiate the cadets a bit faster I think."

14:14:47 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "To be fair, we did spend a week or so out of comms."

14:14:59 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "He spent a lot of time out f comms range."

14:15:17 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "And I repeat him."

14:15:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah so did I as a new pilot, but I think it took all of 2 days of my bein here for it to happen."

16:11:26 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.

16:18:58 a photo of Evenia Callseah
Evenia Callseah is in the photo. She is reclining on a sofa, with her legs teasingly parted. One hand curled around a breast, and a cute little smile on her face.
She appears to be at Apartment 9001; Living Room.
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average, firm breasts with large dark brown nipples. Her abdomen is muscular and punctuated by a small navel. More intimately, she has neatly trimmed jet black pubic hair and a muscular butt. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her close-cropped, bristly hair is indigo and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair. She has a past injury on her throat.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a shiny gold ring pierces her left nipple, a shiny gold ring pierces her right nipple, a thick gold ring with a dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider c
16:18:59 harm pierces her right upper ear, a small bloodstone stud with a matching spider charm pierces her belly button, a thick gold ring pierces her right lower lip, and a thick gold ring pierces her left lower lip.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic glass dolphin, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a glossy obsidian wrist-mounted chronometer, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, and a teal battle hummingbird stamp. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.

16:19:36 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

16:39:08 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Engineering Room]

16:39:09 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go north and down.

16:43:26 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

16:43:26 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

17:57:00 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

17:57:34 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go up and out.

18:00:35 I don't understand that ("minimod" is an ambiguous name).

18:00:40 A greater minimodule of gravitic boost is not equipped.

18:00:47 You drop a greater minimodule of gravitic boost.

18:00:49 Your battlesuit is holding a major minimodule of laser boost, a major minimodule of laser boost, a major minimodule of projectile resistance, a greater minimodule of laser resistance and nanite resistance, a greater minimodule of laser resistance, a moderate minimodule of laser boost, a major minimodule of laser resistance, a moderate minimodule of laser resistance, a major minimodule of laser resistance, a major minimodule of armor boost, a major minimodule of explosion resistance, a major minimodule of gravitic boost, a major minimodule of ammunition capacity and explosion resistance, and a major minimodule of explosives boost.

18:01:27 I don't understand that.

18:01:30 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an AEU Combat Universalist, and a greater minimodule of gravitic boost here.
You can go up and out.

18:01:41 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

18:01:42 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:01:43 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:01:43 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:01:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey allies."

18:01:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:01:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:01:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:02:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Greetings Constantine."

18:02:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Nine jumps to Teslaworld Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:02:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Switching it."

18:02:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Deep Wastes."

18:02:09 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

18:02:12 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:02:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:02:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:02:15 The sensors tell you that this area is full of valuable salvage, but all you can see of it yourself is dark smudges that block the light of the stars.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Eight jumps remaining."

18:04:01 [Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

18:16:17 A greater minimodule of plasma boost is already equipped.

18:16:22 You equip a greater minimodule of energy capacity and energy generation.

18:16:27 Probably not a good idea to be wandering around here while wearing a few hundred extra pounds of armor and weapons.

18:16:28 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

18:17:06 You grin.

18:17:08 You hug Kim Saunders.

18:17:13 Kim says to Vernos, "If we need it, I will call out for it."

18:17:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do minidrones do?"

18:17:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've only ever used the suit in a live-fire test."

18:17:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Help repair."

18:17:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "OK."

18:17:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Minidrones are your repair."

18:18:00 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

18:18:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Seems like we should have a ground combat class sometime."

18:18:09 Vernos Bailey says, "And I assume I don't just throw minidrones about as I wish."

18:18:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be great."

18:18:26 You grin at Vernos Bailey. "We'll tell you what to do."

18:18:30 Vernos Bailey nods.

18:18:30 Kim Saunders nods.

18:18:36 You grin at Vernos Bailey. "Just listen to our fearless leader."

18:18:40 You gesture vaguely at Kim Saunders.

18:18:59 Constantine Stone just arrived.

18:19:00 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

18:19:00 Kim Saunders giggles.

18:19:03 You grin.

18:19:04 Constantine Stone waves.

18:19:10 "Oh, hi!" Kim Saunders smiles at Constantine Stone.

18:19:15 You wave to Constantine Stone.

18:19:18 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Hello hello!"

18:19:19 Kim says to Constantine, "You must be Constantine then?"

18:19:26 Constantine Stone says, "I am."

18:19:26 You say to Constantine, "I'm Shule. Nice to meet you."

18:19:35 Kim Saunders smiles. "My name is Kim."

18:19:40 Constantine Stone says, "Nice to meet you, too."

18:19:44 You smile.

18:19:48 Vernos Bailey waves to Constantine Stone.

18:19:52 Kim Saunders asks, "Are we all ready?"

18:20:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:20:43 Kim Saunders disbands her group.

18:20:44 Kim Saunders uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:20:47 You hold Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

18:20:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Silver Eagle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:20:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:20:50 You hold Vernos Bailey's hand, taking him into your group.

18:20:51 [Starship "Silver Eagle"; Main Deck]

18:21:02 You can't go that way.

18:21:03 Vernos Bailey presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AEU Light Combatant from storage and sets it in front of him.

18:21:04 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

18:21:05 Vernos Bailey presses a button on an AEU Light Combatant, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

18:21:10 You grin.

18:21:23 Ali Candan strides in from the north.

18:21:25 You say, "You can go ahead and deploy your suit."

18:21:28 Constantine Stone presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AEU Light Combatant from storage and sets it in front of him.

18:21:28 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

18:21:39 You grin.

18:21:51 Constantine Stone says, "Whoa, they put it right on the ship for us."

18:21:55 You say, "Yep."

18:21:56 Constantine Stone says, "That's convenient."

18:21:58 You say, "They do."

18:22:02 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

18:22:13 [Aerial Fortress "Space Vermin's Terror"; Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

18:22:13 The aerial fortress appears to be docked to "Silver Eagle."
You see Vernos Bailey (AEU Light Combatant), Constantine Stone (AEU Light Combatant), and a Mutuality Junkbot here.
Ali Candan is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

18:22:20 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All here?"

18:22:25 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

18:22:25 [Aerial Fortress "Space Vermin's Terror"; Deployment]
You see Vernos Bailey (AEU Light Combatant), Constantine Stone (AEU Light Combatant), an EAOS Conjurer, and a Mutuality Junkbot here.
Ali Candan is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

18:22:27 You speak into the microphone.

18:22:30 Ali Candan presses a button on a Mutuality Junkbot, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

18:22:34 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

18:22:49 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Silver Eagle."

18:22:53 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Here we go."

18:22:54 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

18:22:55 You say, "Party time."

18:22:59 Vernos Bailey says, "Wooo."

18:23:13 Vernos Bailey says, "Time to dance with bari."

18:23:14 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

18:23:16 You say, "Heh."

18:23:30 You can't do that right now.

18:23:35 Vernos Bailey says, "You said part."

18:23:35 You can't do that right now.
The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

18:23:40 Vernos Bailey says, "You said party."

18:23:40 You can't do that right now.
You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

18:23:40 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

18:23:50 Two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend from the ceiling and close around Ali Candan (Mutuality Junkbot). The sealed drop pod is quickly hauled into position at the launch tube, then disappears at a high rate of speed.

18:23:51 You say, "Ok, go ahead and launch."

18:23:53 Two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend from the ceiling and close around Vernos Bailey (AEU Light Combatant). The sealed drop pod is quickly hauled into position at the launch tube, then disappears at a high rate of speed.

18:23:53 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)

18:24:13 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

18:24:14 (20 seconds roundtime.)

18:24:33 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

18:24:33 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You see Ali Candan (Mutuality Junkbot) and Vernos Bailey (AEU Light Combatant) here.
You can go west.

18:25:03 You ask, "Uh oh, did Constantine not launch?"

18:25:04 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Constantine Stone (AEU Light Combatant).

18:25:10 You say, "Oh."

18:25:10 Constantine Stone waves.

18:25:13 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Kim Saunders (League Knight).

18:25:13 Constantine Stone laughs.

18:25:16 You say, "And speak of the devil."

18:25:17 Constantine Stone says, "I didn't know how."

18:25:26 Ali Candan says, "Oh, I'm the only tier 5? This is going to be fun..."

18:25:28 You grin at Constantine Stone. "Looks like you figured it out."

18:25:33 Kim Saunders says, "Na, it's fine."

18:25:37 You chuckle at Ali Candan.

18:25:42 Kim Saunders says, "Mixed tiers out here do not matter so much."

18:25:42 You say, "It won't be that bad."

18:25:49 You nod.

18:25:53 Constantine Stone says, "Now."

18:26:00 Constantine Stone says, "I know the gun points at the alien."

18:26:05 Kim Saunders giggles.

18:26:05 Constantine Stone says, "But how do I use the minidrone."

18:26:23 I don't understand that.

18:26:28 Oh no! You currently do not have any proteges!

18:26:54 Kim directs her attention to Vernos Bailey and Constantine Stone as she explains: "Right, first, it would be a good idea if you checked your suits to make sure everything is set up the way you like it."

18:27:03 You nod.

18:27:05 Vernos Bailey says, "Set."

18:27:15 Kim Saunders says, OOCly, "Type commands to set up aliases for weapons and minidrone abilities."

18:27:35 Vernos Bailey says, OOCly, "Closing the front door, brb."

18:28:11 You say to Ali Candan, "What all you got on that suit?"

18:28:15 Vernos Bailey nods.

18:28:18 Ali Candan says, "Everything."

18:28:23 You grin.

18:28:30 Kim Saunders says, "Then, you check the damages of the suits in the squad with that squad damages report."

18:28:45 No one in the squad has damage.

18:28:50 You say, OOCly, "Sqd for short."

18:28:52 Kim Saunders says, OOCly, "Sqd gives you a quick overview of damages with the most damaged suit at the top."

18:29:15 Kim Saunders says to Vernos Bailey, "You can repair on this first bari, if you like?"

18:29:23 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)

18:29:23 This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You see Ali Candan (Mutuality Junkbot), Vernos Bailey (AEU Light Combatant), Constantine Stone (AEU Light Combatant), and Kim Saunders (League Knight) here.
You can go west.

18:29:26 Kim Saunders says, "Then constantine can do the next."

18:29:26 You peer west...

18:29:27 
[Ventilation Tunnels; T-Junction] (inside a battlesuit)
Here, a straight tunnel branches into two alternatives. One can go that way, or one can go that other way. The possibilities are endless!
You see Bari Vine Cluster Alpha here.
You can go north, east, and south.

18:29:33 Vernos Bailey nods.

18:29:36 Constantine Stone says, "Hmm."

18:29:48 You say, "Oh lovley. A nice pretty little bari vine to greet us."

18:29:50 Constantine Stone says, "I might not have equipped the drone."

18:30:01 Kim Saunders says to Vernos Bailey, "In answer to your question, it is not wise to repair when someone is below 10 percent damage."

18:30:04 Vernos Bailey says, "Uh oh."

18:30:08 Vernos Bailey nods.

18:30:23 You say, "It's just kind of a waste of energy."

18:30:26 Kim Saunders says to Vernos Bailey, "Oops. Ok, well, then just shoot for now, Ali can back Vernos up if things go bad."

18:30:32 You nod.

18:30:34 Vernos Bailey nods.

18:30:36 Kim Saunders says, OOCly, "Ug, fail, that was meant for constantine."

18:30:43 Vernos Bailey says, "Lets do this."

18:30:54 Kim Saunders nods. "Right last, do not move before I do."

18:30:57 Ali Candan asks, "You got the minidrone, but forgot to get the ability?"

18:31:01 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

18:31:11 You say, "Probably."

18:31:15 Constantine Stone says, "I bought it, but I don't see anything about it under the battlesuit commands."

18:31:22 Kim Saunders says, "It's my mistake, I should have pointed that out."

18:31:26 Ali Candan says, "Yep. You have to buy a bilities to the module."

18:31:33 You nod.

18:31:34 Constantine Stone groans.

18:31:36 Constantine Stone says, "Sorry."

18:31:42 You say, "Don't worry about it."

18:31:43 Kim Saunders smiles at Constantine Stone. "It's ok."

18:31:45 You say, "We'll be fine."

18:32:21 Kim Saunders says, "Right, this vine. After we move in I would like a regen from Vernos please."

18:32:28 Vernos Bailey nods.

18:32:42 Vernos Bailey says, "Can do."

18:32:45 "I think we've got it all now?" Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

18:32:50 You say, "I think so."

18:32:53 Constantine Stone says, "I think so."

18:32:58 Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah."

18:33:01 Kim Saunders says, "Right then, moving."

18:33:04 Kim Saunders moves west.

18:33:04 Vernos Bailey moves west.

18:52:49 [Aerial Fortress "Space Vermin's Terror"; Starship Access]

18:52:49 You can go north, east, south, west, and up to the starship.

18:52:54 [Starship "Silver Eagle"; Docking Bay]

18:52:54 You see the aerial fortress and deployment station "Space Vermin's Terror" here.
You can go up.
The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:52:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:52:57 [Starship "Silver Eagle"; Main Deck]

18:52:57 You see a large leather couch here.
Ali Candan is standing here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

Kim Saunders is sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair. Constantine Stone is lying down. Vernos Bailey is standing here.
You can go south and out.
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Silver Eagle! Welcome to home space!"

18:53:02 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

18:53:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, well, that would be nice, if one day we could get rid of the bari there forever."

18:53:03 Kim Saunders presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

18:53:03 Kim Saunders accidentally slams her shoulder into Vernos Bailey as she attempts to work with a nearby control panel.

18:53:05 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

18:53:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:53:16 Constantine Stone begins leaning against a wall.

18:53:35 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:53:36 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

18:53:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Silver Eagle. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

18:53:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:53:44 You say, "Thanks for everyone's help."

18:53:46 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

18:53:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "In all honesty, if we want that to happen we will have to clear it every conquest and thoroughly, not just the part until we hit the cocoon."

18:53:49 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

18:53:50 Ali Candan strides out.

18:53:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:53:52 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

18:53:56 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:54:02 Vernos Bailey strolls out.

18:54:04 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

18:54:05 [Starship "Silver Eagle"; Airlock]

18:54:05 Ali Candan is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

18:54:06 Ali Candan says into the PA microphone, "See you guys."

18:54:10 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks!"

18:54:10 You say, "See ya."

18:54:12 You exit the ship.

18:54:12 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The four-person mule "Silver Eagle" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
Vernos Bailey is standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

18:54:24 The one-person cargo hauler "Weekend Warrior" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved to the launching area.

18:54:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

18:54:31 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

18:54:32 I don't understand that.

18:54:33 There appear to be about 17 pilots recently active.

18:54:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, did we want to do a nest?"

18:54:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That was great, thanks everyone."

18:54:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, sure."

18:54:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But let me change my suit around."

18:55:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm up for it."

18:55:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, we will have to see how to sort the suits then."

18:55:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sorry Kim, I forgot. What low tier suits do you have?"

18:56:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Rental tier 2, league and EAOS 3."

18:56:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, so If Vernos comes with us. Vernos in fringe 1, Constantine in AEU 1, you in your rental 2 and me in league 2. How does that sound?"

18:57:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That would work."

18:57:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Vernos, are you up for it?"

18:58:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "In a bit yeah, I was going to explore the processor since I was unable to land before."

18:58:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, right."

18:58:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And hi Eli."

18:59:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And yeah, we do need ground combat lessons, and a ground squad leader too."

18:59:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm not volunteering."

19:00:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "For GSL. Ground combat ins't my strength."

19:00:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Mine neither, although I know the basics. If I did that though, who would be our voice?"

19:00:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Not a big station."

19:01:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Although, having said that. It's the only office I haven't held."

19:01:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And Kim, we need a Voice."

19:02:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "So, for now, guess you're stuck as Voice."

19:02:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

19:02:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I plan to run for whip if I can get my full license before then."

19:02:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Seems like it might be really needed."

19:02:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "So, nest or no nest?"

19:02:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That is the question."

19:02:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am heading back to switch suits."

19:02:58 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

19:03:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I can do a nest."

19:03:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Cool. I need to switch suits too."

19:03:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I will do a nest."

He has broad shoulders and a wide chest. His face is long and boyish, with a straight nose and cleft chin. His lips are faintly upturned and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, his eyes are grey and narrow. His ear-length, straight hair is chestnut brown and neatly combed. He has neatly trimmed light pink fingernails. He has a past injury on his right eyebrow.
 He is wearing a standard grey shipsuit and a pair of shiny black boots. He is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, an ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, and a small cloth sack. His head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

19:12:24 You grin.

19:12:26 Kim Saunders says, "Let me give it is brief check first."

19:12:29 You say, "Ok."

19:12:29 Kim Saunders strides out.

19:12:53 You say to Constantine, "Have you ever been on a nest before?"

19:13:00 You ask, "Actually, either of you?"

19:13:06 Constantine Stone says, "I have not."

19:13:15 You say, "Ok, there are three stages."

19:13:26 Kim Saunders just arrived.

19:13:30 Kim Saunders holds Vernos Bailey's hand, taking him into her group.

19:13:32 Kim Saunders holds Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into her group.

19:13:34 You say, "First stage is when we arrive in the sector, we have to kill the RATs."

19:13:34 Kim Saunders holds your hand, taking you into her group.

19:13:37 Kim Saunders asks, "All ready?"

19:13:40 You say, "Hang on."

19:13:43 Kim Saunders nods.

19:13:56 You say to Constantine, "We do that in the mule. Just like regular space combat."

19:14:01 Constantine Stone says, "Ok."

19:14:29 You say, "Then we all go to the fortress and have to fight the wasps that are protecting the nest."

19:14:52 You say, "It's similar, but not the same as space combat."

19:15:01 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

19:15:12 You say, "And third, is when we get into our battlesuits and go enter the nest."

19:15:19 You ask, "With me so far?"

19:15:34 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I think so."

19:15:39 You say, "Ok."

19:15:43 Vernos Bailey nods.

19:16:04 You say, "We'll go to the nest and talk about the combat on approach to the nest before we actually do it."

19:16:17 Kim Saunders nods.

19:16:18 Constantine says to you, "Sounds good."

19:16:28 You say, "Ok, let's do it."

19:16:30 You grin.

19:30:37 You say, "Ok, now we approach the nest and fight the resistance."

19:30:45 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah."

19:31:01 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

19:31:38 Kim Saunders nods. "While one person flies, another engineers and the others shoot."

19:31:44 Constantine Stone says, "Ok."

19:31:50 You nod.

19:32:03 "Hmm, do you wanna shoot or eng?" Kim Saunders looks at you thoughtfully.

19:32:04 You say, "Thre are three weapons on here."

19:32:24 You nod.

19:32:25 You say, "True."

19:33:13 Kim Saunders points out controls as she explains: "There, your controls for the missiles. We can fire them forward or rearward, depending on where the target is.

19:33:22 Constantine Stone says, "Ok."

19:33:45 Kim Saunders says, "You are in the port weapons room, so you only shoot at targets that are on the port side."

19:33:55 Constantine Stone nods.

19:34:05 Kim Saunders says, OOCly, "Commands are mis f and mis r."

19:35:31 Constantine Stone nods.

19:35:43 Constantine Stone asks, "When do I want to use grapeshot intead of a missile?"

19:35:51 Kim Saunders says, "Also forward and rearward, they do damage only if the target flies thorugh them."

19:35:58 You nod.

19:36:11 Kim Saunders says, "Never fire a missile after you fire grapeshot, as you just destroy your own grapeshot with it."

19:36:17 Constantine Stone says, "That makes sense."

19:36:38 You say, "It's a common mistake. I think I've done it a time or two."

19:36:47 Kim Saunders nods. "Me as well."

19:36:47 Constantine Stone asks, "Is the fortress going to call out targets that you're tracking?"

19:36:52 Constantine Stone asks, "Just like the ship?"

19:37:06 Kim pointing at the laser controls: "Finally, we have lasers on the sides of our fortress, if the target moves alongside, that's what we fire at them."

19:37:17 Constantine Stone says, "Ok."

19:37:21 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey."

19:37:31 Kim Saunders says, "No, I do not track them, but you will see them as they approach."

19:37:37 You say, "Exactly."

19:37:49 Kim Saunders says, OOCly, "Commands for grapeshot are gra f and gra r, and for lasers are just las."

19:37:53 Constantine Stone nods.

19:38:04 Constantine Stone says, "I will maintain visual scanning."

19:38:10 "Should I explain rolling?" Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

19:38:14 You say, "Nah."

19:38:16 Constantine Stone says, "Please do."

19:38:18 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, ok."

19:38:27 Kim Saunders says, "We will save that for another time."

19:38:32 You say, "Well, ok. But rolling can gt confusing."

19:38:35 You say, "Get."

19:38:53 Kim Saunders says, "Yeah, it is handy, but let's try it without for today."

19:38:58 You nod to Kim Saunders.

19:39:00 You say, "I concur."

19:39:21 Kim Saunders says, "Right, I will get us to descend, so we can go somewhere. Then I can come stand with you and help if you need it."

19:39:26 You exclaim, "Woo!"

19:39:30 Constantine Stone says, "Sounds good."

19:39:32 You say, "Time to play with duct tape."

19:45:01 
[Aerial Fortress "Space Vermin's Terror"; Port Turret]
The aerial fortress appears to be hovering just inside the entrance of a RATS nest.
Constantine Stone is standing here.
You can go northeast, east, and southeast.

19:45:04 [Aerial Fortress "Space Vermin's Terror"; Control Center]

19:45:04 Kim Saunders is standing here.
You can go southeast, south, and southwest.

19:45:08 [Aerial Fortress "Space Vermin's Terror"; Control Center]

19:45:08 The aerial fortress appears to be hovering just inside the entrance of a RATS nest. A screen is currently displaying a tactical map of a "Destroy Minor RATS Nest" mission.
Kim Saunders is standing here.
You can go southeast, south, and southwest.

19:45:10 Kim Saunders says into the PA microphone, "Minor."

19:45:12 Kim Saunders strides southwest.

19:45:18 You see Vernos Bailey (Fringe Warrior) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

19:45:24 I don't understand that.

19:45:26 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves a League Infantryman from storage and sets it in front of you.

19:45:27 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

19:45:28 You press a button on a League Infantryman, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

19:45:30 Kim Saunders strides in from the north followed by Constantine Stone.

19:45:31 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

19:45:31 (20 seconds roundtime.)

19:45:51 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

19:45:51 (20 seconds roundtime.)

19:46:11 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

19:46:11 [RATS Nest; Drop Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This is just inside a location where the nest is open to space. Before you extends a series of tunnels, which are strangely organic-looking, yet clearly crafted from metal.
You can go northeast.

19:46:16 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Vernos Bailey (Fringe Warrior).

19:46:21 You peer northeast...

19:46:22 
[RATS Nest Interior] (inside a battlesuit)
This is the interior of the nest. There is no light here save that provided by battlesuit torches. Tunnels twist here and there, many too small for you to navigate. The walls possess a manufactured regularity, while the layout seems organic and unpredictable.
You see Mobile Laser-Equipped Sentry Alpha here.
You can go northeast and southwest.

19:46:34 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Constantine Stone (AEU Light Combatant).

19:46:37 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Kim Saunders (AISSF Rental Advanced Combat Armour).

19:46:42 Constantine Stone says, "Let me check my commands really quick."

19:46:47 You say, "Awesome."

19:46:50 You say, "Go for it."

19:46:51 Kim Saunders nods.

19:47:31 Constantine Stone says, "Ok."

19:47:37 You say, "Cool cool."

19:47:40 You ask, "Everyone set?"

20:22:40 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

20:22:43 Kim Saunders presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

20:22:43 Kim Saunders accidentally slams her shoulder into Shule Elemmire as she attempts to work with a nearby control panel.
(8 seconds roundtime.)

20:22:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

20:22:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:22:49 Kim Saunders exclaims, "Darn, Sorry!"

20:22:51 You say, "Oops."

20:22:53 You say, "Sorry."

20:22:54 [Starship "Silver Eagle"; Airlock]

20:22:54 You can go enter into the ship.

20:23:05 You hear a sharp clank from the hull somewhere near you.

20:23:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:23:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:23:25 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Thanks guys for coming along."

20:23:28 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks for the nest!"

20:23:29 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "And good job."

20:23:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:23:33 You exit the ship.

20:35:01 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "So quiet\."

20:35:18 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It happens sometimes."

20:35:18 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

20:36:18 Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the south.

20:37:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It is quiet. Maybe people are just waiting to talk, then our comms will explode."

20:57:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "There is probably a reason why we are selling some books only to our own alliance."

20:57:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And sure, you can ask."

20:57:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "If a person declines then that is their right."

21:35:23 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

21:35:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. 
21:43:52 If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly wi
21:43:52 th his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on 17 April 2317 GST. Time remaining: 13 days, 4 hours, 17 minutes, and 39 seconds

21:55:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

21:57:33 You see a cruiser here.
"Supernova" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AH-12b" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. The bays of its minicannon launchers are somewhat scuffed and painted silver. Its landing struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a silver AEU logo forward on the starboard side, a geodesic radome, a smooth dome, and a single large port covered by an iris-style hatch on the forward end, and the hull has an odd sheen to it, as if covered in a thin gossamer webbing.

You can go up and out.

22:11:19 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

22:11:20 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:11:21 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:11:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:11:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:11:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:11:30 I don't understand that.

22:11:33 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

22:11:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:11:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:11:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:11:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:11:47 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:11:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:11:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:11:51 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:11:51 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:11:53 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:11:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:11:55 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 329" has jumped into the sector.

22:11:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:11:58 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Fearless! Welcome to home space!"

22:16:01 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

22:16:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.

22:50:49 You glance at your communicator's screen.

22:50:50 Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Greetings pilots! I am happy to have noticed a sharp upswing in decoy beacon drops and missions. I encourage you all to continue this upward trend. Remember, if anyone needs anything at all related to space combat or anything else in general, feel free to send a letter to Ather, or to call the space defense captain's office so we can set up times to meet. Additionally, with the influx of new pilots, I am contemplating holding refresher classes for how to deal with IFS, Outsiders, RATS, allied pirates etc. Let me know when would be a good time for everyone and I'll try to set up the best possible time.

23:55:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Because if not, we will have another mystery to solve."

23:55:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I suppose one or two pilots wanting to explore as AEU is not really enough to justify keeping a ship in production."

23:56:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Although I hope to take a long trip and discover something unknown myself one day."

23:56:27 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Dioes anyone have a clue of how many command I need before the org can start renting ships?"
