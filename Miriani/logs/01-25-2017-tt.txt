Hi Lily and Shule,
As promised, I write to you to inform you of the result of the vote I conducted
among our members.
The details of the vote were as follows:
Would you like for Starseekers to continue to support Alpha 777? Pick the option
that best describes your feelings.
The 5 options everyone could choose from were as follows:
Yes, I want to use it myself.
No, I don't go there.
Maybe, if you think people will use it.
I really don't care.
If other people want to pay for our modules, why not.
Our members were given close to 72 hours to vote and in the end 5 out of our 6
members gave their vote.
I regret to inform you that with 60 %, the winning option was number 2, No, I
don't go there. The options Maybe, if you think people will use it and I really
don't care each received 20 % of votes. 
The conclusion is that by choice of our members, Starseekers will not support
Alpha 777, and by extention Alpha 776 for the forseeable future.
I understand your wish to help newer pilots with these stations, but people are
really not using them much at all. We can build all kinds of things to help out,
but if they are not being used, then ultimately we are not helping. Maybe the
travel distance stops people from wanting to go there, maybe because belt of
Orion has grade 20 and 30 as well.
My advice for now is to let it rest for several months, because I also got the
distinct impression that people are getting tired hearing about salvage station
changes. Maybe one day one of us will get lucky in finding something that more
pilots would like to use.
I know this is not the outcome you hoped for, but I hope you can understand our
decision.
take care,
Kim

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small
purple trash bin, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing
yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, and
Purr the humanoid service robot here.

I will listen to it again and again or at least until you remove it from your
dropbox folder. I wanted you to know that the final RP between our characters
affected me just as strongly but I'm not talented enough to express it as
beautifully as you did. I'm very touched that I could inspire you to make such a
beautiful piece. When I first heard the song, I cried at my computer. I want to
hear it a few more times to capture all the essences of the good times and
nostalgia along with the sadness. Again, thank you for this.

Thank you, I'm glad you liked it. The piece started out really sad, but I wanted
it to reflect the good things too, you know?  So I pumped as much nostalgia into
it as I could manage. It's been a while since I've made an emotional piece like
that. Thanks for the inspiration :)
