awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. It is asleep. Its stomach is
bulging, but it seems content to slowly digest its large meal.

has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
Her right leg is bruised and swollen. 
 She is wearing a pair of very brief coral pink cotton panties with a row of
tiny embroidered flowers in the front and a pair of tan suede clogs. She is also
wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender
bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple

[Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Repairing
Nuclear Broadcast Facility; Docking Bay.
