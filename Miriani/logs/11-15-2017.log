00:54 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, and a shiny white starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

00:55 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:55 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

Standard equipment includes: Class 7 solar charging array, enhanced sensor array, planetary survey scanners, class 10 hull plating with battlecruiser hardening, an enhanced relativity drive, an alliance specialty subwarp drive, a Galactic Map Unit, a navigational automatic vector interface, and an intrasystem slip drive. To accomodate the power system necessarily to drive the technology available, the Dart does suffer from slightly slower drive recharge times and a moderately weakened laser power system. To compensate, the Griffin Research Laboratory released an upgrade called a laser overdrive capacitor, a piece of technology that will feed energy wasted during NAVI transit and store it in a buffer. Once the buffer is 10% or fuller, the starship's laser array will be able to draw energy from the buffer to amplify their diminished firepower, bringing it on par with standard defensive equipment."

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, and a shiny white starship simulator here.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, and a shiny white starship simulator here.

01:48 [General Communication] Alexander Artorius transmits, "Not trying to stop you if you want to crew, just offering."

01:48 You peer out and see...

01:48 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

01:48 [General Communication] Jack Mason transmits, "It's all cool man, everything is that way when you are down with the clown."

01:48 [General Communication] Kitty Mars transmits, "Do you already have an engineer?"

01:49 [General Communication] Alexander Artorius transmits, "No problem. Well, I'm ready to get back in the saddle when new diffs come around."

01:49 [General Communication] Stan Maro transmits, "One way or another I am down for shooting."

01:49 [General Communication] Jack Mason transmits, "Stand bye for bay."

01:49 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:49 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

01:49 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:49 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
You're already sitting down.

01:49 You're already buckled in.

01:49 The ship is already moving.

01:49 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:49 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:49 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:49 [General Communication] Kitty Mars transmits, "Ok I'll catch you all another time."

01:49 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:49 The ship must be in space to do that.

01:49 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:49 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:49 Those coordinates are currently occupied.

01:49 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 9, 8."

01:49 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:49 The eight-person gunship "Imminent Demise" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

01:49 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:49 [General Communication] Cody Williams transmits, "Gamma."

01:49 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:49 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20). You may also specify a destination name.

01:50 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:50 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

01:50 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

01:50 [General Communication] Jack Mason transmits, "Gamma it is."

01:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

01:50 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:50 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

01:50 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

01:50 You stand up.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma] (indoors)
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Carnival of Carnage", the ten-person battlecruiser "Tribulations", the ten-person battlecruiser "Immortal Salvation", the four-person roborant "Chain of Memories", the six-person destroyer "Magical Melody", the eight-person gunship "Imminent Demise", and the one-person expediter "Zoom Zoom" landed here.

Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons.

12:38 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, and a shiny white starship simulator here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Eden" powered down here.

15:54 ["Samma" Weapons Room 3] (indoors) (sitting on a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

15:59 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, and a shiny white starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

15:59 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.
You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

16:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:00 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

16:00 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:00 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:00 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:00 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:00 The computer announces, "Seven planets have been detected in the sector."

16:00 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:00 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 18, 3, 9."

16:00 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:00 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:00 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:00 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:00 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

This small lobby area features pale blue carpet and creamy white walls which serve to give the cramped space a more open atmosphere. A large silver bell is sitting on a wooden desk in the middle of the room, and behind it, a wooden door with a nameplate reading Mr. Barrister stands firmly closed. To the east, another office lies with a sign above the door proclaiming it to be a property transferral center. A sign posted on the front of the counter reads, Please ring the ASSIST bell to speak to a realtor. One will contact you within a few days.

This dingy little office has the same pale blue carpet as the outer lobby, but the creamy white walls here are dingy with smoke. An empty leather office chair, the back cracked in several places, sits behind a battered metal desk in the middle of the room. Tall file cabinets are everywhere, and this small room has no windows to look out of.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Aquatimis; Landing Pad.

16:06 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:06 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Seven planets have been detected in the sector."

16:06 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

16:06 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

16:06 The ship is already moving.

16:06 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:06 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:06 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:06 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:06 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

16:06 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:06 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:06 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:06 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:06 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

16:07 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

16:07 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, and a transparent architectural de

16:44 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

16:44 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

16:44 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

16:44 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:44 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

16:44 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:44 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:45 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:45 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:45 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

16:45 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:45 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

16:45 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:45 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:45 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

16:45 The three-person freighter "Radical Rainbow" has jumped into the sector.

16:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

16:45 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

16:45 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa along the eastern wall, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a compact light blue cooler on wheels, a glowing blue medical drone, a glowing blue security drone, Ia the droid, and Eo the droid here.
You see Erik Yobi (staring into space) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

16:48 ["Samma" Weapons Room 4] (indoors) (sitting on a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a small white marble side table with twisting iron flower vines encircling the tabletop, a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a turquoise plastic cooler on wheels, and a silver trash bin here.
You can go northwest.

16:49 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

16:50 [General Communication] Moiraine Soto transmits, "So there are two people I am waiting on I think. Stan and who?"

16:50 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

16:50 [General Communication] Stan Maro transmits, "Just landed."

16:50 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

16:51 Stan Maro's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "In one if you want someone else here let me know."

16:51 [General Communication] Moiraine Soto transmits, "Ok. Last call. 2 spots. Mods."

16:51 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

16:52 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:52 #$#hjelp

16:52 Moiraine Soto's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Right. So we are way way undercrewed. Literally, Erik is in eng but he is staring. There are only 3 of you gunning. Please do it efficiently."

16:52 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:52 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:52 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:52 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:52 Rogan Steele's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "not a prob"

16:52 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I'll do my best."

16:52 Stan Maro's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "10.4"

16:53 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:53 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:53 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

16:53 Rogan Steele's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Do you have eng and control room, or you want me to watch damages?"

16:53 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:53 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:53 Moiraine Soto's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I've got it."

16:53 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:53 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:53 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:53 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:53 Rogan Steele's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Ok, then focusing on killing anything that moves"

16:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:53 You stand up.

17:14 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

17:14 You peer northwest and see...

17:14 ["Samma" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a cylindrical silver metal trash bin with a lid, a comfortable rich blue brocade engineer's chair, a deep indigo star-patterned leather sofa along the eastern wall, a small white marble side table set with a fragrant floral arrangement, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a compact light blue cooler on wheels, a glowing blue medical drone, a glowing blue security drone, Ia the droid, and Eo the droid here.
You see Michael Calaway here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

17:14 ["Samma" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a thin layer of marble. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a small white marble side table with twisting iron flower vines encircling the tabletop, a comfortable rich blue brocade crew chair, a red plastic cooler on wheels, a turquoise plastic cooler on wheels, and a silver trash bin here.

17:14 Moiraine Soto's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Right, here we go."

17:14 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

17:14 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

17:15 [Private | Lena Mylan] You transmit, "Just chuckling at your comments on short range."

17:15 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

18:20 [Newbie] Geoffrey Obrien: It's been a very, very long time since I've played on here. Are there still fuzzy lifeforms that randomly show up when salvaging?

18:20 [Newbie] Allen Robinson: Yes.

18:20 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: Yes.

18:21 #$#hjelp

18:22 [Newbie] Geoffrey Obrien: How would yall suggest I go about handling that IC? Because of the reroll status, I have no newbie tag, which makes me think that the newbie protection that prevents newbies from getting them isn't there.

18:22 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: Do you have a stun gun?

18:23 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: It isn't there. Get a lone, get a weapon, and some ammo, then go salvaging. You should be all set.

18:23 [Newbie] Geoffrey Obrien: No, and my char doesn't know they exist yet. Perhaps if he gets one, he could land, get out of his ship, and call for help?

18:23 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: I (think) that if you don't have a stun weapon, they don't show up.

18:23 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: Your character went to pilot academy, so yes, he would know about stun weaponry.

18:23 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: Oh yes they do, it happened to me.

18:23 [Newbie] Scott Franklin: Oh, wow. Interesting.

18:23 [Newbie] Allen Robinson: They do show up. Just buy a stun weapon.

18:24 [Newbie] Geoffrey Obrien: Thanks loads, all!

18:24 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: Hence why I said, take it out as part of your lone required for buying a cargo hauler.

18:24 [Newbie] Geoffrey Obrien: Would he know where to find those weapons by going through the pilot academy?

18:24 #$#hjelp

18:25 [Newbie] Cara West: I see the newbie tag as more of an ooc thing since newbies have no clue how to play here what so ever. If you're a reroll. Hense no newbie tag, you know everything you need to know from pilot training.

18:26 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: You could always act like you know that they exist but aren't sure whree to find them. Just a quick question, where can I buy stun weapons, would suffice, I'd think.

18:26 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: You could also play as though you slept through or other wise did not pay attention in that class.

18:37 You peer out and see...

18:37 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Green", the six-person destroyer "Samma", and the three-person antagonizer "Primordial Storm" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Chitter the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, Beta the droid, Alphy the droid, Mjolnir the droid, a pale black leather rolling backpack with several compartments, Ia the droid, and Eo the droid here.
You can go northwest, east, and southwest.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, and a transparent architectural design simulator here.

18:42 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

18:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:42 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

18:42 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

18:42 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

18:43 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

18:43 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

18:43 ["Unnatural Disaster" Weapons Room 6] (indoors) (sitting on a silver leather recliner with a built-in seat warmer)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a silver leather recliner with a built-in seat warmer here.

18:43 [Short-range Communication] Cody Williams transmits, "Fight."

18:43 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

18:43 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

18:43 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

18:43 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "alright, so for the new comers, we will do one more gunship dif, but, would you guys be in for a bc old dif?"

18:43 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

18:43 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "sure"

18:43 Alexander Artorius's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Any gunners that are 3 or less hits in a mod or 5 or less hits in a diff are tied in my book because I'm not sure how well the system counts partials and such."

18:43 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

18:43 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

18:43 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Ten starships have been detected in the sector."

18:43 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

18:43 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

18:43 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

18:43 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

18:43 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

19:50 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

19:50 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

19:50 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

19:50 Calyssa Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "awe"

19:50 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

19:50 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

19:50 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

19:50 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

19:50 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

19:50 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

19:50 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

19:50 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

19:50 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

19:50 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

19:51 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

19:51 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

20:03 You deftly draw a stun turret from a soft black leather stun weapon holster.

20:03 A stun turret

20:03 A stun weapon made for pure, raw power. It mounts to the user's forearm with a powerful clamp and braces against their chest. It has a set of rotating barrels that fire a powerful stun charge, able to stop anything dead in its tracks. It comes with a small eyepiece for targetting and displaying the ammunition count.
You take a quick glance at a stun turret, noting that the effective stun power is 31 and that it is loaded with a high-capacity magazine and has 13 shots left.

20:06 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

20:07 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:07 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:07 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:07 You don't see that here.

20:07 You access a silver portable point unit and note you have 6040.86 license points and 5099.56 combat points.

20:07 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

20:07 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

20:07 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

20:08 There are no ships here.

20:08 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

20:08 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

20:08 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

20:08 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

20:08 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

20:08 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

20:08 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:08 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:08 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:13 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Erm laughable."

21:13 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "Come on new diffs."

21:13 [General Communication] Alexander Artorius transmits, "I don't know. To me a bc pilot shouldn't be boxxed in a grouping of up to 50 ships or they shouldn't have a bc. But I've got strong opinions on what makes a bc pilot."

21:13 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "Come on new diffs diffs diffs diffs diffs diffs difs."

21:14 [General Communication] Cody Williams transmits, "I wish to gun."

21:14 [General Communication] Tom Tucker transmits, "It's actually surprisingly easy to get boxed with just 30, but then, I don't claim to be the most skilled flyer."

21:14 [General Communication] Alexander Artorius transmits, "It depends on if you're sitting in the middle or actively ranging one out of the larger fleet."

21:15 [General Communication] Alexander Artorius transmits, "If you stay moving across the combat grid they're in each others way and your path will stay clear. If you stay around the northwest corner you're crewed."

21:15 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "5 more bag of bones, just 5 more bag of bones."

21:16 [General Communication] Tom Tucker transmits, "Yeah. My tactic with bigger fleets is pick a reasonably threatening target, then let it go where it wants to go, and follow it to ugly coords if you can fly there. I don't try to stay near 3 3 3 in larger swarms."

21:16 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "We can't get 5 bags of bones, well can we get 4 bag of bones?"

21:16 [General Communication] Alexander Artorius transmits, "You can use your position relative to your target to actually pull it apart from the other ships if you're comfortable with the grid. But I'm not here to argue semantics."

21:17 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "Anyone paying attention the the new diff broadcast, we are offering new diffs, come one come all, you bag of bones."

21:17 [General Communication] Alexander Artorius transmits, "5 spots. Come on people. New diffs all day."

21:17 [General Communication] Cara West transmits, "I heard ray call so you only need 4 it sounds like."

21:17 [General Communication] Allon Martellato transmits, "I personally don't give two shites how you handle it, so long as everything gets killed. Is it worth risking a situation where you're getting boxed if you don't do well in that situation? I mean, in that case you'd either be running forever, or you'd lose your bc. If acrobatics are your cup of tea, then sure, don't run box. Everyone has different piloting preferences. So why must we insist on arguing and putting each other down for the purpose of being the bigger and badder pilot?"

21:18 [General Communication] Therman Donaldson transmits, "I added him in in an earlier broadcast. So just 5."

21:18 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Thank you allon that was my whole point."

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, an internal stun turret, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, and a transparent architectural design simulator here.
You can go so
22:35 uth and out.

22:35 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Blossom the droid, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Chops the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the dr
22:35 oid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet medical drone, a compact black security drone, Katherine the droid, Am the droid, Ma the droid, a sleek black hovercraft, a transparent blue security drone, and a transparent pink medical drone here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

22:35 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:35 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

22:35 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

22:36 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

22:36 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:36 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
> (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

22:36 The ship is already moving.

22:36 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:36 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:36 There are no ships here.

22:36 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:36 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:36 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

22:36 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

22:36 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Torndano.

22:36 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

22:36 The ten-person battlecruiser "Storm of Torment" has jumped into the sector.

22:36 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

22:36 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

22:36 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

22:36 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

22:36 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:36 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:36 This ship transmits, "Yo"

22:36 Via general sector communication, Storm of Torment transmits: "sup"

22:36 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:36 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:36 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:36 This ship transmits, "not much"

22:36 The ten-person battlecruiser "Storm of Torment" has left the sector.

22:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:36 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

22:36 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:17 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:17 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:17 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:17 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:17 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person fighter "Seeking the Enemy" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

23:17 The one-person fighter "Seeking the Enemy" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

23:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

23:17 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

23:17 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:17 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:21 [Short-range Communication] Jack Mason transmits, "Did you find the enemy?"

23:21 [Short-range Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Maybe the enemy is verywhere."

23:21 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:21 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:21 [Short-range Communication] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Everywhere."

23:21 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:21 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:21 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

23:21 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:21 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:21 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:21 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:22 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:22 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

23:22 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:49 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

23:49 Alexander Artorius's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "get comfortable. I want 500 more points by Saturday"

23:49 #$#soundpack social | laugh | male

23:49 Jack Mason laughs over the intercom.

23:49 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:49 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I want 500 mill by next saturday"

23:49 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:49 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "you can get armor for a bc?"

23:49 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:50 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:50 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:50 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:50 Alexander Artorius's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "can you or is that just for the 15 person thing"

23:50 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:50 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "i thought it was only for the 15 person thing"

23:51 You hear several loud thuds as cargo is transferred from the ship.

23:51 A loud whirring sound comes from the ship's storage room as motorized lifts haul cargo away.

23:51 You hear the bustle of activity from the ship's cargo hold.

23:51 The noises coming from the storage room gradually cease until they can be heard no more.

23:52 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "i did a new dif in one once, it was pretty epic"

23:54 You peer west and see...

23:54 ["Bravitzlana Rubakalva" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. You see a painting of a series of gentle hills rolling into a pink and gold sky and an enormous cedarwood grandfather clock hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a brown leather sofa, a cream beanbag chair, an oak wood trash bin, a compact black refrigerator, and three compact black security drones here.
You can go east and west.

23:54 Alexander Artorius's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "more?"

23:54 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "sure"

23:55 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "I can do one more."

23:55 Aaliyah Morales's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "yeah"

23:55 Alexander Artorius's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I need 8 more"

23:55 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

23:55 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "8?"

23:55 #$#soundpack social | grumble | male

23:55 Jack Mason grumbles over the intercom.

23:55 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:55 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "At least he didn't say 80 more"

23:55 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:55 Alexander Artorius's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "for my daily goal"

23:56 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:56 Alexander Artorius's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I want to get to 5500 by the end of the day."

23:56 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:56 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:56 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:56 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:56 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:56 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:57 Jack Mason's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "if you need me, i'll be drinking vodka"

23:57 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:57 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:57 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:57 Alexander Artorius's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I do need you to gun. not that you can't do that while drinking vodca, but"

23:57 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.
