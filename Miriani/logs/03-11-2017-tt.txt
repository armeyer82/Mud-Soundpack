Recent Minor Changes:
-----
Mission-related debris will now always credit its full original weight toward
completing the mission. This means that compressing mission-related debris will
no longer allow one to contribute more pieces than usual to complete the
mission.
   Posted 6 days, 3 hours, 20 minutes, and 3 seconds ago
-----
Mission-related debris is now worth fewer points when tossed into a
debris-burning station, in order to prevent unusual point gains related to
missions.
   Posted 6 days, 3 hours, 14 minutes, and 59 seconds ago
-----
Starships belonging to inactive organizations (that is, the founder and trustees
are inactive) will no longer be granted launch clearance.

Subject: Pirate attacks
Author: Ather Jammoa
Posted: 16:20 28 January 2317 GST

Attention pilots:
it has been brought to my attention that there was a major attack conducted by
Mr. Kelsey's allied pirates over the Belt of Orion early on the morning of
January 28. The attackers used several larger vessels, as well as Bolt Throwers
to drive off the civilian pilots that attempted to fight it off. What is truly
concerning is the lack of willingness from members of our own corps who were
active at the time, but did not crew. Let me emphasize that no matter what
you're up to, if any sectors get invaded by obvious threats, you should drop
what you're doing and volunteer for a crew spot. The AEU once was one of the
most active alliances for fighting off invasions. To not even volunteer to crew,
even if you're for some reason incapable of combat piloting, is completely
stupid. In future, I expect to see a good AEU showing when fighting off an
invasion, or as good as we can get it under the current circumstances. I don't
want to hear about pilots turning off their comms again seconds after an
invasion was announced and a request for crewing went out just because they
might not wish to crew. This is our space too! Let's defend it.
That being said, with the current crop of pilots that are available to us, no
one has any excuse to not at least be somewhat proficient in at least flying a
fighter, in the event that all crewing stations are full on ships attempting to
drive off an invasion. If you've been slacking off on learning to fly in combat,
well, I will once again tell you, feel free to contact me either via mail, or
call the SDC office. Let me know you're available times, and we can work out a
training schedule. Everything helps in an invasion. Even a fighter.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a pair of
gray canvas sneakers, and a pair of tan suede clogs here.
You can go out.

Minor Change:
Starship PA functionality has received several improvements.
 - Things said over the PA are now echoed back to you.
 - Social commands and emotes will now function over the PA. For example, try
"pa laugh" or "pa :chuckles dryly." Note that doing inaudible things over the PA
is, of course, out of character.
 - You can use the PA ON/OFF command to toggle an open mic on the PA in that
room. When on, everything audible in that room will be heard all over the ship,
in a similar manner to how phones work.
 - A line has been added to starship room descriptions to indicate when the PA
has an open mic.
