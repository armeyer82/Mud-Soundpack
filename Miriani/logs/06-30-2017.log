[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

02:50 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

04:32 ["Vengeful Justice" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.

["Guardian of The Night" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a small flat disc containing the image of Dorion and Alycen, a large stone wall clock, and a tiny flounder hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Primal Tranquility; Docking Bay.

05:32 ["Guardian of The Night" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. A translucent frosted glass light ivory desk lamp is casting a warm gold light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a black suede recliner, a narrow onyx pastel ivory statue of a warrior with his sword held aloft, a light brown beech wood bench, a flower bed full of radiant tulips with blue and white petals, two cherry tomato vines, an orange-yellow narcissus tree, a stainless steel electric piano, a wide comfortable leather-covered red piano bench, a wrought iron trellis twined with sunflowers, a large canopy bed with a midnight blue silk curtain and an ocean blue bedspread, a soft royal blue velvet sofa with a light throw over the back, a small rich mahogany bedside table, two raspberry bushes, three strawberry bushes, three blueberry bushes, two blackberry bushes, and an internal stun turret here.

14:54 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

19:44 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

20:56 [Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage.

21:24 Michael Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "if yobi has 3"

21:24 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

21:24 Britney Chance (C) (Female) is asleep!

21:24 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

21:24 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

21:24 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person sentinel "Nightingale" has initiated an intrasector slip.

21:24 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

21:24 Moiraine Soto's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Sorrys Mikey. Was a little confused for a second there."

21:24 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person sentinel "Nightingale" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

21:24 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:25 Michael Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "no problem"

21:25 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:25 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

21:25 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

21:25 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:25 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:25 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:25 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:25 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:50 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.
