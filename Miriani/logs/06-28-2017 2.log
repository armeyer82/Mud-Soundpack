01:16:41 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:19:27 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Deep Space Operations Nuclear Temporary Station in Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285.

01:27:01 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Alright all of those interested in Salvage Ops. Please come to old Earth Lounge, so we can start getting folks separated and assigned. It would seem we have enough for two full Op crews."

01:28:18 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

01:28:19 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a pair of white cotton briefs here.

01:28:21 You scramble to your feet.

01:28:21 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo slides to the floor.
[Starship "William Dove"; Observation Deck]
You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing red and light green aquatic life and coral rocks, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:28:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]

01:28:22 You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion and a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

01:28:23 You can't go that way.

01:28:23 You can't go that way.

01:28:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

01:28:25 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:28:25 You exit the ship.

01:28:25 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

01:28:28 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

01:28:28 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:28:29 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:28:30 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:28:30 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:28:31 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:28:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:28:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:28:47 The ship is already moving.

01:28:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:28:48 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:28:48 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:28:49 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

01:28:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:28:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:28:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:28:56 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:28:56 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

01:28:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:28:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:29:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:29:01 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:29:01 Your communicator reports that...

01:29:03 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

01:29:04 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:29:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:29:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:29:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:29:20 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:29:20 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:29:21 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

01:29:21 You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:29:21 You exit the ship.

You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

01:29:22 The two-person light corvette "Bach To Battle, Reprise" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

01:29:23 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

01:29:23 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a salt lick, Manx the little calico CatBot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
Jacob Smitt is sitting on a cushy booth seat. Rogue Romano is sitting on Jacob Smitt's lap. Aisling the Fox and Hakeem Oiadip are sitting on a comfortable wooden chair. Bryan Stout, Michael Kennedy, Pilot Kerry Rodriguez, Elissa Rosales, and Nathaniel Owens are standing here.
You can go out.

01:29:24 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person runabout "Dawnrunner".

01:29:29 Bryan Stout frowns.

01:29:30 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person light corvette "Bach To Battle, Reprise" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

01:29:31 Hakeem Oiadip waves frantically!

01:29:36 Nathaniel Owens waves.

01:30:37 Bryan Stout says, "All the pillows."

01:30:41 You grin.

01:30:41 Melinda Michaels whistles.

01:30:45 Hakeem Oiadip asks, "11, 12?"

01:30:51 Your communicator reports that...

01:30:51 
At least twelve recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

01:30:57 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the eight-person mantis mark three "Carcharocles Megalodon".

01:30:57 You say, "12 are here at the moment."

01:32:04 Melinda Michaels asks, "I thought Eli was taking one?"

01:32:05 Hakeem Oiadip nods.

01:32:12 Rogue Romano says, "Oh."

01:32:22 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Sure."

01:32:25 Jacob Smitt says, "Not sure, he said he was coming back. But I haven't heard much after that."

01:32:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Sort it when he gets here I guess."

01:32:29 Rogue Romano says, "I know defense for me. Don care who's crew I go on."

01:32:42 Pilot Kerry Rodriguez says, "Defence to."

01:32:44 A group a table over have a conversation about pilots from other alliances while rolling their eyes and shaking their heads.

01:32:54 Jacob Smitt glances down at his wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

01:32:56 Hakeem Oiadip says, "I do whatever, need to grind the locks, but do whatever."

01:33:00 Bryan Stout says, "Let."

01:33:04 Melinda Michaels says, "Y'all are gonna need salvagers."

01:33:09 Jacob Smitt laughs.

01:33:13 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Can do."

01:33:37 Jacob Smitt speaks into his off-white metachannel FTL communicator:

01:33:37 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Last call, five minutes and we start assignning."

01:33:38 Rogue Romano orders a warm butterscotch cookie.

01:33:49 Elissa Rosales gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:33:56 Hakeem Oiadip steps up to a brightly-lit candy vending machine.

01:33:57 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Need any salvagers?"

01:34:01 Hakeem Oiadip carefully presses a button on a brightly-lit candy vending machine and receives a Fudge Fusion Bar.

01:34:08 Gonzales Bourne removes an icky plastic cockroach from a small cloth sack.

01:34:08 Elissa Rosales says, "I'll be right back."

01:34:09 Hakeem Oiadip forcefully hurls a Fudge Fusion Bar at Elissa Rosales.

01:34:10 Elissa Rosales deftly catches it.
Elissa Rosales dances out.

01:34:12 Jacob Smitt says, "I'll give him more time. Just wanted to give another reminder."

01:36:37 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "I'll help with defense if you still need some."

01:36:41 Caleb Davenport says, "One sec."

01:36:43 Caleb Davenport walks out.

01:36:46 Melinda Michaels says, "The easiest way to do this is for everybody to sit down. Then those who cannot salvage, stand up. So we can see who has to be on defense."

01:36:53 Jacob Smitt speaks into his off-white metachannel FTL communicator:

01:36:54 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Come to old Earth lounge Kat."

01:36:56 Gonzales Bourne sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.

01:37:10 Bryan Stout sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.

01:37:14 Gonzales Bourne says nothing to Eli Grey.

01:37:14 Elissa says to Eli, "You ok?"

01:37:19 Eli Grey asks, "Can I just stay standing up if I can salvage?"

01:37:20 Caleb Davenport just arrived.

01:37:24 Melinda says to Eli, "Sit."

01:37:34 Lillian Hudson sits down on a cushy booth seat.

01:37:37 Gonzales says to Eli, "We especially did wait for you as we believe you'll lead the second crew!"

01:37:40 Elissa Rosales smiles.

01:37:46 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay pilots who do not have grade 50 grapples, up."

01:37:49 Elissa Rosales stands up from a cushy booth seat.

01:37:51 Michael Kennedy stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

01:37:56 A Tardick lizard named Isis, perched on Lillian Hudson's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:38:04 Melinda Michaels asks, "That it?"

01:38:10 Michael Kennedy smirks.

01:38:12 Elissa Rosales smirks.

01:38:15 Elissa Rosales says, "I'm getting there."

01:38:24 Gonzales Bourne says, "Now do the walk of shame."

01:38:36 Hakeem Oiadip sighs.

01:38:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay I wanted to check the numbers."

01:38:39 Ali Candan's group just arrived.

01:38:47 Your communicator reports that...

01:38:47 
At least seventeen recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

01:38:50 Elissa Rosales takes a bite of a warm lemon-poppy seed muffin.

01:38:51 Melinda Michaels says, "We've got three who cannot salvage."

01:38:54 Ali Candan says, "17. Yay."

01:38:54 You say, "17 so far."

01:39:04 Melinda Michaels says, "I'll bow out then."

01:39:11 Rogue Romano glances around at her surroundings.

01:39:13 Hakeem Oiadip says, "You don't need me, I am out."

01:39:14 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:39:18 Melinda says to Hakeem, "Stay."

01:39:19 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Too tired."

01:39:21 Pilot Kerry Rodriguez gasps.

01:39:25 Rogue Romano asks, "Looks like three ops?"

01:39:28 Hakeem Oiadip shakes his head.

01:39:29 Rogue Romano says, "Damn."

01:39:34 Hakeem Oiadip stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

01:39:38 Pilot Kerry Rodriguez says into his indigo metachannel FTL communicator, "Wow! Um 17 people here for this op! 17!"

01:39:41 Melinda Michaels says, "No 8 people per op."

01:39:41 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Thanks guys."

01:39:44 Hakeem Oiadip slinks out.

01:39:53 Gonzales Bourne says, "Nah. 5 defense 3 salvagers for each crew. Checks out."

01:39:58 Your communicator reports that...

01:39:59 
At least sixteen recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

01:40:02 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the vostok-class capsule "Blurr" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

01:40:03 Melinda Michaels asks, "Okay who is flying?"

01:40:07 Rogue Romano says, "So total of sixteen."

01:40:07 Jacob Smitt says, "I can."

01:40:13 Melinda Michaels asks, "Who else?"

01:40:13 Gonzales Bourne says, "I can too."

01:40:21 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

01:40:22 Pilot Kerry Rodriguez says, "I'll swap with jacob if he needs a brake."

01:40:27 Katina says to Melinda, "This wil be my first I can gun?"

01:40:32 Melinda says to Katina, "Sure."

01:40:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Gonna need two engineers."

01:40:47 Lillian says to Katina, "You have to. You don't have the grade of grapple we need."

01:40:58 Katina smiles in relief.

01:41:04 Rogue Romano says, "I can be one of engineers."

01:41:13 Jacob Smitt asks, "One more?"

01:41:20 Melinda Michaels points at you.

01:41:23 You say, "Sure."

01:41:25 Lillian Hudson grins.

01:41:26 You say, "I can engineer."

01:41:30 Ali Candan disbands his group.

01:41:42 Melinda Michaels says, "So Ali is salvaging, we need 5 more."

01:41:44 Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:41:47 Lillian Hudson says, "I'll salvage."

01:41:48 Nathaniel Owens says, "Me."

01:41:51 Gonzales Bourne says, "Alright, I'll bring Orca."

01:41:54 Gonzales Bourne stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

01:41:56 Melinda Michaels says, "That's 3."

01:41:58 Gonzales Bourne sprints out.

01:41:59 Eli Grey says, "I have my transport here, so I might as well salvage."

01:41:59 Katina Faye says, "Sec."

01:42:00 Katina Faye dances out.

01:42:04 Melinda Michaels says, "4."

01:42:10 Elissa Rosales asks, "I thought Gonzales was flying?"

01:42:11 Jacob says to Eli, "I thought you were bringing your puslor."

01:42:13 Bryan Stout says, "Whoops."

01:42:14 Jacob Smitt says, "Pulsor."

01:42:15 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the four-person mule "Falco Peregrinus" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

01:42:16 Melinda Michaels grumbles.

01:42:20 Katina Faye just arrived.

01:42:21 Rogue Romano says, "He's gettin' his ship I think."

01:42:25 Rogue Romano shrugs.

01:42:27 Ali Candan says, "He went to get a torp boat."

01:42:28 Jacob Smitt says, "Gonzo is."

01:42:29 Michael Kennedy says, "He said he was."

01:42:31 Eli says to Jacob, "I originally said that, but I think things have evolved since then."

01:42:38 Bryan Stout glances around at his surroundings.

01:42:40 Caleb Davenport says, "I would prefer to gun."

01:42:40 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay, I'll salvage."

01:42:43 Elissa Rosales gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:42:45 You say, "I can bring a pulsar."

01:42:49 Bryan Stout says, "I'd like defense if I can."

01:42:51 You say, "Or a gunship."

01:42:52 Lillian Hudson says, "No please don't make her salvage. I'll pay for it later."

01:42:57 Bryan Stout grins at Lillian Hudson.

01:42:57 You chuckle.

01:43:00 Jacob Smitt says, "I have my gunship."

01:43:02 Melinda says to you, "We have ships for these."

01:43:32 Bryan Stout gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:43:32 Nathaniel says to Melinda, "Why do you hate salvaging so much?"

01:43:41 Elissa Rosales says, "I kind of like it."

01:43:48 Lillian Hudson says, "Crazy talk."

01:43:48 Melinda says to Nathaniel, "I just do."

01:43:49 Elissa Rosales shrugs.

01:43:50 "No problem." You shrug. "Just heard someone mention something about a pulsar."

01:43:52 Ali Candan says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Perfect."

01:43:58 Melinda Michaels nods to you.

01:44:08 Rogue Romano asks, "Okay, who will grab canisters?"

01:44:14 Jacob Smitt says, "I will grab one."

01:44:20 Melinda Michaels says, "Two people from the defense teams."

01:44:21 You say, "And figured I probably have one or two laying around somewhere."

01:44:32 Bryan Stout says, "I can grab one."

01:44:35 Melinda Michaels says, "So they can be picked up once they get out there."

01:44:44 You hear the ringing of the nearby ferry and the answering calls of seagulls.

01:44:48 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the five-person torpedo boat "Orcinus Orca".

01:44:49 Melinda Michaels says, "Don't grab till you see whose team you are going with."

01:44:59 Bryan Stout absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

01:44:59 Melinda Michaels says, "Y'all will get screwed up."

01:45:02 Lillian Hudson nods.

01:45:02 Bryan Stout laughs.

01:45:08 You laugh.

01:45:08 Gonzales Bourne just arrived.

01:45:17 Jacob Smitt says, "I could grab Gonzo's and he can grab mine. Then we can be officially fucked."

01:45:18 Bryan Stout asks, "Who are the two teams?"

01:45:24 Gonzales Bourne glances around at his surroundings.

01:45:30 Melinda Michaels says, "I'll salvage for Gonzo."

01:45:31 Jacob Smitt says, "Joking, joking."

01:45:34 Bryan Stout says, "Hakeem and Jacob? Oh."

01:45:38 Eli Grey sighs.

01:45:38 Ali Candan says, "I'll salvage for Gonzo too."

01:45:43 Lillian Hudson says, "I'll go with Gonzo as well."

01:45:49 Lillian Hudson says, "There ya go."

01:45:56 You say, "Hakeem isn't coming I though."

01:45:56 Jacob Smitt says, "Ok."

01:46:01 Melinda Michaels says, "Hold on."

01:46:02 You say, "Thought."

01:46:12 Melinda says to Gonzales, "Take shule."

01:46:18 Gonzales Bourne nods.

01:46:20 Gonzales Bourne takes you into his group.

01:46:20 Melinda says to Jacob, "Rog goes with you."

01:46:25 Jacob Smitt stands up from a cushy booth seat.

01:46:26 Rogue Romano falls from Jacob Smitt's lap.
Rogue Romano nods.

01:46:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah that's her name."

01:46:28 Jacob Smitt holds Rogue Romano's hand, taking her into his group.

01:46:31 Bryan Stout laughs.

01:46:31 Pilot Kerry Rodriguez stands up from a cushy booth seat.

01:46:31 Lillian Hudson grins at Melinda Michaels.

01:46:33 Rogue Romano grins.

01:46:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Then pick your gunners."

01:46:39 Jacob says to Rogue, "Sorry."

01:46:40 Gonzales Bourne takes Katina Faye into his group.

01:46:45 Caleb Davenport joins Jacob Smitt's group.

01:46:45 Jacob Smitt takes Pilot Kerry Rodriguez into his group.

01:46:48 Elissa Rosales joins Jacob Smitt's group.

01:46:48 You stand up from a comfortable wooden chair.

01:46:51 Gonzales Bourne takes Bryan Stout into his group.

01:46:58 Melinda Michaels points at Michael Kennedy.

01:47:10 Nathaniel Owens stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

01:47:13 Gonzales Bourne takes Michael Kennedy into his group.

01:47:13 Eli Grey asks, "Since i'm salvaging, do you care if I just go on out there and sit?"

01:47:20 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Debris-Burning Temporary Station involving the two-person light corvette "Bach To Battle, Reprise".

01:47:21 Melinda Michaels says, "Hmm."

01:47:22 Jacob Smitt says, "That's totally fine."

01:47:32 Eli Grey nods.

01:47:32 Nathaniel Owens asks, "Who's team am I a part of?"

01:47:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Jacob."

01:47:39 Ali Candan says, "Jaky."

01:47:39 Eli Grey stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

01:47:44 A well-dressed man speaks in hushed tones to a nearby pilot and hands him a small credit chip.

01:47:49 Nathaniel Owens asks, "Ok, mind if I go check the transport?"

01:47:52 Eli Grey asks, "And have salvagers already been assigned to teams?"

01:47:56 Lillian Hudson nods.

01:47:58 Melinda Michaels asks, "Sec, is somebody left out?"

01:47:59 Jacob Smitt says, "Gonzo's has."

01:48:10 Melinda says to Eli, "You're with Jacob."

01:48:16 Eli says to Melinda, "Ok."

01:48:20 Bryan Stout asks, "I get the can from orion right?"

01:48:30 Jacob Smitt says, "No out there I believe is where it is."

01:48:34 Lillian Hudson says, "No, the op stations' at 285."

01:48:39 Melinda Michaels asks, "Everybody know who they are going with?"

01:48:39 Bryan Stout says, "Oh okay."

01:48:41 Rogue says to Jacob, "You wan me to grab can for our crew?"

01:48:48 Jacob Smitt says, "If you want."

01:48:50 Melinda Michaels says, "Here's the trick."

01:49:05 Elissa Rosales asks, "Can someone please explain to me about the can?"

01:49:10 Melinda Michaels says, "One op goes west and the other goes east so we don't fuck up and put shit in the wrong can."

01:49:10 Lillian Hudson says, "Sec."

01:49:17 Rogue Romano nods.

01:49:17 Jacob Smitt says, "Totally."

01:51:20 You peer north...

01:51:20 
[Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a decoy beacon launcher here.

01:52:19 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Weapons Room Three]

01:52:19 Gonzales Bourne is standing here.
You can go south and down.

01:52:20 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

01:52:20 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Corridor]

01:52:20 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:52:23 You peer up...

01:52:23 
[Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You can go south and down.

01:52:33 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Weapons Room Three]

01:52:33 You can go south and down.

01:52:33 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

01:52:34 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Engineering Room]
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

01:52:38 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the north.

01:52:42 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Rogue I'll meet you out there on the station with the cans."

01:52:44 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

01:52:51 Gonzales Bourne sprints north.

01:52:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:52:59 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Everything checks out. Let's go."

01:53:06 Weapon Room Status

01:53:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:53:10 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Weapons Room Three]

01:53:11 You can go south and down.

01:53:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:53:12 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Corridor]

01:53:12 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:53:16 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:53:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey love! What's up?"

01:53:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:53:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:53:34 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 168,233.54 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

01:53:43 I don't understand that.

01:53:46 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 168,233.54 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

01:53:46 The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space station.

01:53:51 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 168,233.54 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

01:53:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi love. We just left to go do salvage ops."

01:53:56 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:53:56 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:54:06 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

01:54:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Darn ok."

01:54:23 You scramble to your feet.

01:54:23 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Weapons Room One]
You see a personal hoverpallet here.
Michael Kennedy is lying down.
You can go east.

01:54:25 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Corridor]

01:54:25 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:54:26 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Weapons Room Two]

01:54:26 Katina Faye is standing here.
You can go west.

01:54:29 You smile at Katina Faye.

01:54:31 Katina Faye waves to you.

01:54:34 You say to Katina, "Hi."

01:54:37 Katina Faye exclaims, "Hello!"

01:54:45 You grin.

01:54:48 Katina Faye asks, "How are you?"

01:54:55 You ask, "Doing great. How are you?"

01:55:00 Katina Faye says, "I'm hanging in there."

01:55:04 You smile.

01:55:09 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 168,233.54 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

01:55:25 Katina Faye says, "I'm sleepy actually."

01:55:30 You say, "Awww."

01:55:33 You say, "I'm sorry."

01:55:39 Katina Faye says, "It's all good."

01:55:42 Katina Faye says, "Being stubborn."

01:55:45 Katina Faye says, "Fighting sleep."

01:55:46 You say, "Should drink some coffee."

01:55:51 Katina Faye says, "Too late."

01:56:02 You say, "Or I could just tickle you every time you fall asleep."

01:56:06 You smirk.

01:56:22 Katina Faye stretches.

01:56:30 Katina Faye says, "I'm working on it."

01:56:32 Katina Faye giggles.

01:56:34 Katina Faye says, "Staying awake."

01:56:35 You grin.

01:56:42 You tickle Katina Faye!

01:56:49 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Lily, we will be working east of the roid station so as to steer clear of the other op."

01:56:49 Katina Faye groans.

01:56:55 Katina Faye says, "Too sleepy for that."

01:56:59 You chuckle.

01:57:16 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok."

01:57:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 168,233.54 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

01:57:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Are you joining us?"

01:57:50 You ask, "Hmmm, should I pour water on you then?"

01:57:54 You chuckle.

01:57:57 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "8 minutes."

01:57:59 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Who's hungry?"

01:58:05 Michael Kennedy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Where's the food!"

01:58:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You're joining us?"

01:58:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire cheers.

01:58:20 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There."

01:58:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I think so is that ok with you?"

01:58:27 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he chortles.

01:58:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise laughs.

01:58:32 Michael Kennedy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not sure how this would go down."

01:58:36 Michael Kennedy's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he snickers.

01:58:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Of course!"

01:58:43 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All these prejudges."

01:58:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm glad you get to participate!"

01:59:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well you know I don't like salvaging but beats sitting back here twiddling my thumbs."

01:59:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah."

01:59:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm doing your normal job on the ship."

01:59:59 You say, "Don't go to sleep."

02:00:00 Katina Faye asks, "Hmm?"

02:00:04 You grin.

02:00:04 Katina Faye says, "Sorry, it's hard."

02:00:06 Katina Faye giggles.

02:00:12 You chuckle.

02:00:28 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Of course! Thought would go well with it."

02:00:37 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Eta?"

02:00:42 Michael Kennedy's voice comes over the loudspeaker: "I put the cockroach in the juice?" snickers.

02:00:50 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "1 minute and 35 seconds."

02:00:54 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Copy."

02:00:59 You say, "Ok, good luck."

02:01:04 You wave to Katina Faye.

02:01:07 You hug Katina Faye.

02:01:08 Katina gazes sleepily up at you.

02:01:11 You say, "Have fun."

02:01:14 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Full dive."

02:01:14 Katina Faye nods.

02:01:19 [Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Waiting one sector east for Gonzo's op."

02:01:26 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Corridor]

02:01:26 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

02:01:27 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Weapons Room Three]

02:01:27 You can go south and down.

02:01:29 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

02:01:33 I can't find "chair."

02:01:35 [Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Engineering Room]

02:01:35 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

02:01:38 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

02:01:48 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Hey, where is your furniture?"

02:02:04 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think Katina ate them."

02:02:06 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'm one west, waiting for the can."

02:02:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hardly Eli."

02:02:07 Michael Kennedy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "He believes that his crew performs their best, standing."

02:02:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:02:13 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And that yeah."

02:02:15 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ate whuh?"

02:02:21 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Bryan Stout has rented a medium moderate-grade salvage canister at League Deep Space Operations Nuclear Temporary Station.

02:02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I know you aren't but there's at least one person who is."

02:02:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ah ok."

02:02:34 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:02:39 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

02:02:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:02:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:02:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That's what?"

02:02:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Huh?"

02:02:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "At least one person that is what?"

02:03:02 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:03:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:03:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

02:03:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:03:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "There's at least one person that is what?"

02:03:37 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Going west to wait there."

02:03:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Wow why do I have a habbit of pressing the wrong button latelytr gen not experienced with ops I suppose."

02:03:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah, ok."

02:03:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "At least one person who's on an op for the first time I think. They might be on defense though."

02:04:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok."

02:04:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh yeah, Katina has never been on an op. She's on my ships for defense."

02:04:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, the ship that I'm on."

02:04:32 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Rogue Romano has rented a medium moderate-grade salvage canister at League Deep Space Operations Nuclear Temporary Station.

02:04:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Uh wait I thought stout rented a can what's going on here."

02:05:01 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Gonzo, tell Bryan when you are in the roid station sector so he can drop the can and be picked up at the repair station."

02:05:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Two ops are going on at the same time."

02:05:16 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "I'm all ready to pick him up."

02:05:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Brian rented for us."

02:05:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:05:27 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Lily, ETA?"

02:05:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh joy hope I don't go to the wrong can."

02:05:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:05:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "This is confusing."

02:05:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Just stay east of the temp stations."

02:05:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:06:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Not that easy to do if I can't go anywhere but east."

02:06:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:06:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

02:06:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:06:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, true. But our salvage can will be one sector east of 285."

02:06:50 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok i'm a bit confused. I'm in the 285 sector so where will the ban be and whose crew?"

02:06:58 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Come east Lily."

02:07:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Think you are East Lily."

02:22:27 You peer north...

02:22:28 
[Starship "Orcinus Orca"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
Bryan Stout is standing here.
You can go south and down.

03:47:36 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.

03:47:42 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:47:42 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

03:47:51 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

03:52:43 You smile.

03:52:44 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:52:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:53:49 You say, "Never been to one. Just heard of it."

03:53:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:54:01 Katina says to you, "What happens?"

03:54:09 You say, "People paint each other."

03:54:16 Katina says to you, "Mmhmm."

03:54:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:54:22 Katina says to you, "Sounds innocent enough."

03:54:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:54:27 You say, "Well, I was involved in an impromtu one."

03:54:33 [Salvage Op] Lily Kaise: "Lazy so I'll feed orion."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond. Her

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

04:49:27 Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be 'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a special application in character generation.

12:09:40 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:09:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

12:10:05 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Nuevo Laredo here, we record an inbound Fringe fighter."

12:10:10 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is flight control in Nuevo Laredo, a Fringe fighter is outbound."

12:10:10 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Chetumal Orbit flight control, this is Chetumal, we detect a Fringe fighter inbound."

12:11:00 Your communicator reports that...

12:11:00 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

12:11:06 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

12:11:08 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:11:08 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:11:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:11:11 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Chetumal here, Fringe fighter heading for us."

12:11:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:11:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth flight control here, AEU destroyer heading for space."

12:11:22 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

12:11:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:11:36 Which sector did you mean?

12:11:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:11:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

12:11:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:11:42 The starship is already moving.

12:11:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:11:45 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in New Earth here, an AEU destroyer is outbound."

12:11:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

12:13:42 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

12:13:42 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

12:13:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:13:46  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee with a large white lightning bolt appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

12:13:46 You are carrying nothing.

12:14:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:14:11 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

12:14:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

12:14:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:14:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

12:14:31 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:14:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.

12:21:41 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Chet."

12:21:44 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm in, but don't think Lily is."

12:21:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:21:55 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

12:22:00 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:22:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:22:01 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:22:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:22:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:22:15 The ship is already moving.

12:22:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:22:17 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:22:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:22:18 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

12:22:20 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Katina, beacons?"

12:22:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:22:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:22:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:22:24 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:22:25 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

12:22:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:22:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:22:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:22:29 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:22:31 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:22:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

12:22:32 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

12:22:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:22:35 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I wish I could but I don't think I currently have enough time and I could only engineer at best."

12:22:45 The computer reports that the scout "White Eagle" has jumped into the sector.

12:22:48 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Non Serviam" has landed on the planet Chetumal.

12:22:48 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, White Eagle! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

12:22:50 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Sure can I have like 10 minutes?"

12:22:51 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "eep beep"

12:22:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:22:53 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

12:22:56 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok."

12:22:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

12:22:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:23:03 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So please look for someone else."

12:23:08 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Thanks."

12:23:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

12:23:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:23:11 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:23:14 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:23:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi love."

12:23:23 You scramble to your feet.

12:23:23 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

12:23:24 You exit the ship.

12:23:24 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
The one-person cargo hauler "Non Serviam", the three-person clipper "Firestorm", and the scout "White Eagle" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can, and Vim the mound of parking tickets here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

12:23:26 [Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

12:23:26 You see a gleaming granite-topped bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a trash can emblazoned with the triumphant image of Space Chief Marshal Nina Thomas here.
You can go out.

12:23:30 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the scout "White Eagle" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

12:23:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good day love."

12:23:43 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

12:24:19 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "We are meeting at chetumal."

12:24:36 Kim Saunders just arrived.

12:24:42 You smile at Kim Saunders.

12:24:44 [Tactical Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Ok I come gun."

12:24:49 You hug Kim Saunders.

12:24:52 You say to Kim Saunders, "Hi1."

12:24:55 "Hi!" Kim Saunders hugs you.

12:24:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh by the way, probably wouldn't be recommended that putting up the asteroid processor in 288 should be publicized. I don't want to get into the politics hehe. Even though I agree with the sentament, I didn't advise anyone as to what to do."

12:25:00 Lexie Amarras just arrived.

12:25:09 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the four-person mule "Stinger" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

12:25:11 Lexie Amarras says, "Hiya."

12:25:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, I know and I agree."

12:25:34 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Would you like to join the next one katina?"

12:25:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

12:25:41 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Yes."

12:25:46 Lexie Amarras says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Correction to that last i'm in the lounge."

12:25:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise chuckles.

12:25:51 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok, thank you."

12:25:54 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Wait, how many people do we have so far?"

12:26:05 Lexie Amarras says, "Four I think."

12:26:14 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "We have caleb, you, me, lexie, kim."

12:26:14 Kim Saunders says, "I don't know."

12:26:18 You say, "Mmm, think more than that."

12:26:22 Lexie Amarras nods.

12:26:22 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "And katina need some time."

12:26:38 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "I do I'm a bit preoccupied at the moment."

12:26:43 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

12:26:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I am surprised she was able to get the asteroid processors from Cats. So it was interesting when I looked around on the transport."

12:26:44 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I can do the first one, but then I got to run. I have errands to run."

12:27:01 Lexie Amarras leans on a brightly-lit candy vending machine.

12:27:12 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok. So that's five."

12:27:14 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Just let me know when you're ready please."

12:27:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah."

12:27:22 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Not A Target Drone!" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

12:27:27 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I think I might only do one but will see."

12:27:35 Lexie Amarras laughs.

12:27:41 Lexie Amarras says, "I like that one, not a target drone."

12:27:49 You chuckle.

12:27:51 You grin.

12:27:54 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

12:28:29 You peer out...

12:28:29 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The five-person mass production scythe "Cleopatra" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can, and Vim the mound of parking tickets here.
Caleb Davenport and Alko Delovega are standing here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

12:28:37 Lexie Amarras says, "I'm a little better than I was the last time you and I shot at stuff, I might be up to 15% this time."

12:28:40 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We're in the lounge."

12:28:41 Lexie Amarras smiles.

12:28:52 Caleb Davenport just arrived.

12:28:54 You grin at Lexie Amarras.

12:28:55 Lexie Amarras nods to Caleb Davenport.

12:28:58 Lexie Amarras says, "Hiya."

12:29:03 Caleb Davenport says, "Hiii."

12:29:05 You say, "Yeah, I need to learn to gun faster too."

12:29:15 Lexie Amarras says, "And you were the best one of the three of us."

12:29:22 Caleb Davenport says, "Ha I have never quite figured out speed gunning."

12:29:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Anyway Love, have a great day. Seeya later and fly safely!"

12:29:30 You grin at Caleb Davenport.

12:29:33 Caleb Davenport says, "I just just gun the best I can."

12:29:38 Alko Delovega just arrived.

12:29:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, you too. I love you. See ya later."

12:29:42 Alko Delovega holds Caleb Davenport's hand, taking him into his group.

12:29:43 Alko Delovega holds Lexie Amarras's hand, taking her into his group.

12:29:44 Alko Delovega holds Kim Saunders's hand, taking her into his group.

12:29:46 Alko Delovega holds your hand, taking you into his group.

12:29:47 Alko Delovega waves.

12:29:53 Lexie Amarras nods.

12:29:54 You ask, "Who's engineering?"

12:29:58 Lexie Amarras says, "Hiya."

12:29:58 Alko Delovega says, "Someone."

12:30:05 Alko Delovega says, "Not sure."

12:30:06 You say, "I can."

12:30:08 Alko Delovega nods.

12:30:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Love you too!"

12:30:18 Alko Delovega exclaims, "Let's do it!"

12:30:20 Lexie Amarras nods.

12:30:45 You peer north...

12:30:45 
[Starship "Cleopatra"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad.
Caleb Davenport is standing here.
You can go south and down.

13:02:01 [Starship "Cleopatra"; Engineering Room]

13:02:01 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.

14:22:50 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'm in."

14:23:00 [General Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "I."

14:23:04 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I can fly or whatever, prefer to fly."

14:23:06 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Same."

14:23:14 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Lounge and we'll sort it."

14:23:15 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Katina flies."

14:23:23 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "What."

14:23:26 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:23:26 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:23:28 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:23:31 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "You said same."

14:23:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:23:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:23:41 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "You're at Chetumal Hakeem?"

14:23:41 The ship is already moving.

14:23:43 The ship is already moving.

14:23:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:23:44 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:23:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:23:45 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "No way, you aren't making her fly and have us get unregs so early in her career."

14:23:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

14:23:47 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

14:23:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:23:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:23:50 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Elissa, if you are at old earth, I will come to you."

14:23:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:23:51 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:23:52 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

14:23:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:23:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:23:56 [General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "I am at old earth, yes."

14:23:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:23:56 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

14:23:58 AutoStar detects 5 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

14:23:59 [General Communication] James Seiko transmits, "Awww why not."

14:23:59 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

14:23:59 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

14:24:02 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:24:04 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Festina Lente" has landed on the planet Old Earth.

14:24:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:24:06 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:24:10 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Chained To The Rhythm" has landed on the planet Old Earth.

14:24:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

14:24:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:24:18 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Have james fly. He said why not."

14:24:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:24:22 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:24:22 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:24:22 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Be right there."

14:24:24 You scramble to your feet.

14:24:24 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

14:24:25 You exit the ship.

14:24:25 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The two-person light transport "Chained To The Rhythm" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

14:24:26 The reactionless drive of the two-person light transport "Chained To The Rhythm" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

14:24:26 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

14:24:26 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Katina Faye is sitting on a cushy booth seat. Gonzales Bourne is standing here.
You can go out.

14:24:28 Elissa Rosales just arrived.

14:24:28 [General Communication] James Seiko transmits, "Oy."

14:24:33 Elissa Rosales sits down on a cushy booth seat.

14:24:34 Gonzales Bourne removes a plain flat einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

14:24:35 Elissa Rosales takes a bite of a warm banana nut muffin.

14:24:36 Melinda Michaels just arrived.

14:24:36 Gonzales Bourne punches a number into a plain flat einrophone.

14:24:40 You wave.

14:24:44 You sit down on a comfortable wooden chair.

14:24:46 Ali Candan just arrived.

14:24:50 Elissa Rosales exclaims, "Hi Ali!"

14:24:52 I don't understand that.

14:24:53 Gonzales Bourne sprints out.

14:24:54 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

14:24:56 Ali Candan exclaims, "Hi Lissa!"

14:25:00 Elissa Rosales grins.

14:25:09 You say, "Hi everyone."

14:25:12 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey."

14:25:15 Elissa Rosales says, "Heyy."

14:25:16 Elissa Rosales grins.

14:25:28 "How is the kitten popping going?" Melinda Michaels taps Katina Faye.

14:25:31 Melinda Michaels laughs.

14:25:34 You chuckle.

14:25:37 Katina Faye blushes.

14:25:39 Katina Faye says, "No more."

14:25:39 Elissa Rosales giggles.

14:25:47 Melinda Michaels frowns.

14:25:50 Katina Faye says, "Only 2, I made sure."

14:25:53 Katina Faye giggles.

14:25:56 You chuckle.

14:25:59 Melinda says to Katina, "Whatever will I tease you about now?"

14:26:00 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the three-person flying wing "Stormy Skies".

14:26:05 Hakeem Oiadip just arrived.

14:26:08 Hakeem Oiadip waves.

14:26:08 Katina bites her lip.

14:26:08 Gonzales Bourne just arrived.

14:26:12 Elissa Rosales cheers for Hakeem Oiadip!

14:26:12 Katina Faye waves.

14:26:16 Ali says to Melinda, "Should I give you ammunition?"

14:26:16 Melinda Michaels waves.

14:26:19 Hakeem Oiadip gives a large red long-eared felo kitten to Elissa Rosales.

14:26:23 Elissa Rosales exclaims, "Awwwww!"

14:26:29 Elissa says to Hakeem, "Ok, so what do I need to know?"

14:26:33 Elissa Rosales strokes the soft fur of a large red long-eared felo kitten.

14:26:33 A large red long-eared felo kitten purrs softly.

14:26:36 Melinda says to Ali, "If you don't, I'll make up something."

14:26:43 You chuckle at Melinda Michaels.

14:26:59 Hakeem says to Elissa, "You need a tonic to make it live longer, and food. If you don't have enough cash now, I can give you, since you are a new pilot and that felo is cute."

14:27:06 Elissa Rosales asks, "A tonic?"

14:27:14 Hakeem says to Elissa, "Hold it for now, and we talk after the op?"

14:27:22 Melinda Michaels says, "Do not set it down."

14:27:26 You nod.

14:27:31 Elissa Rosales says, "Ok."

14:27:31 Hakeem Oiadip sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.

14:27:36 Melinda Michaels says, "It'll nest and you'll be the next kitten popper."

14:27:38 Elissa Rosales laughs.

14:27:40 You laugh.

14:27:41 Elissa Rosales says, "Ok."

14:27:43 Hakeem Oiadip grins at Melinda Michaels.

14:27:43 Katina says to Melinda, "I was gonna say."

14:27:45 Katina Faye smirks.

14:27:46 Elissa Rosales giggles at Katina Faye.

14:27:55 Say to whom?

14:27:55 Melinda Michaels asks, "Okay how many are we?"

14:27:59 Melinda Michaels says, "Let's see."

14:27:59 Your communicator reports that...

At least seven recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

14:28:00 Ali Candan says, "7."

14:28:01 Your communicator reports that...

14:28:01 
At least seven recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

14:28:04 You say, "7."

14:28:05 Elissa Rosales says, "I have to go."

14:28:14 Elissa Rosales says, "I was just waiting for the kitten."

14:28:19 Elissa Rosales asks, "Where doI find the tonic?"

14:28:19 You say, "Oh."

14:28:26 Elissa Rosales asks, "The pet store?"

14:28:36 Melinda Michaels speaks into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator:

14:28:36 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Anybody else doing this crazy op thing?"

14:28:48 Melinda says to you, "The torrus, east side."

14:28:51 Hakeem says to Elissa, "The torus, yes, you will need food too, from Helios Station or the repair shop."

14:28:51 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

14:28:54 Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings.

14:28:58 You grin at Melinda Michaels. "I know."

14:29:01 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I did enough ops for me for a while on the trip."

14:29:03 Elissa Rosales asks, "Repair shop?"

14:29:03 Melinda Michaels points at Elissa Rosales.

14:29:06 Hakeem says to Elissa, "Took good care of the felo."

14:29:08 You grin.

14:29:09 [Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I need a little time before I can."

14:29:10 Ali Candan speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

14:29:10 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Come gun at least."

14:29:11 Hakeem Oiadip nods to Elissa Rosales.

14:29:23 Hakeem Oiadip says, "There is a felo feeding option."

14:29:24 Melinda says to Elissa, "Felo store."

14:29:29 Elissa Rosales says, "I am so confused."

14:29:31 Elissa Rosales frowns.

14:29:34 Elissa Rosales says, "I don't want it to die."

14:29:36 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Felo store."

14:29:39 Elissa Rosales asks, "On Torus?"

14:29:41 Melinda says to Hakeem, "Show her now. You've time."

14:29:44 I don't see that here.

14:29:46 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Too sleepy to gun well."

14:29:47 Hakeem Oiadip holds Elissa Rosales's hand, taking her into his group.

14:29:47 You nod to Elissa Rosales.

14:29:49 Elissa Rosales stands up from a cushy booth seat.

14:29:52 Elissa Rosales finishes off a warm banana nut muffin.

14:29:52 Hakeem Oiadip stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

14:29:59 Hakeem Oiadip's group slinks out.

14:30:01 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll be fine."

14:30:06 Ali Candan speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

14:30:06 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Excuses excuses."

14:30:09 Gonzales Bourne says, "You just made his day."

14:30:12 You grin at Ali Candan.

14:30:15 Melinda Michaels laughs.

14:30:16 Ali Candan chortles at Gonzales Bourne.

14:30:21 Ali says to Gonzales, "Get out of my mind."

14:30:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Well, he gave the felo, he needs to properly show people what to do. So we don't get all the kittens."

14:30:40 Katina Faye grins.

14:30:45 You grin.

14:30:52 Melinda Michaels speaks into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator:

14:30:53 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "How much time Kim?"

14:30:55 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

14:31:05 Melinda says to Ali, "Now, ammo?"

14:31:14 Melinda says to Ali, "Are you guys like dating or something?"

14:31:15 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the three-person flying wing "Stormy Skies" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

14:31:16 Melinda Michaels beams.

14:31:36 Ali says to Melinda, "Nope. Be more creative."

14:31:45 Gonzales Bourne asks, "What are you trying to accomplish, give Hakeem a heart-attack?"

14:31:53 Ali Candan says, "He did, yesterday."

14:31:53 Melinda says to Ali, "I was going to send her some condolence flowers if you were."

14:31:55 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

14:31:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

14:31:57 Melinda Michaels applauds sedately and grins.

14:32:00 Gonzales Bourne grins at Ali Candan.

14:32:04 Katina Faye blushes.

14:32:07 Katina Faye says, "Where's my muffin."

14:32:09 Katina Faye stands up from a cushy booth seat.

14:32:09 Katina Faye dances out.

14:32:17 Katina Faye just arrived.

14:32:17 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Woo."

14:32:18 Katina Faye sits down on a cushy booth seat.

14:32:20 Ali says to Melinda, "Hey I'm not that bad."

14:32:21 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm chocolate chip muffin.

14:32:29 Melinda says to Ali, "You gotta admit, that was a good one."

14:32:31 Melinda Michaels laughs.

14:32:59 Ali Candan beams.

14:33:01 Melinda Michaels speaks into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator:

14:33:01 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We'll sort that out when you get here and we find out how much time Kim needs."

14:33:05 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Think we'll figure that out when everyone gets here."

14:33:11 Melinda Michaels looks at Katina Faye thoughtfully.

14:33:15 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok, I will come with my transport in case."

14:33:16 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm chocolate chip muffin.

14:33:23 Gonzales Bourne says, "My orca's here. I could either fly or salvage."

14:33:29 Katina Faye asks, "Can I gun?"

14:33:31 Ali Candan says, "My Orca's not here."

14:33:42 Melinda Michaels says, "I think Hakeem asked to fly."

14:33:52 Melinda says to Katina, "You can gun."

14:33:52 Ali Candan says, "My Kartal and Akrep are here though. Also Timsah."

14:33:54 Ali Candan beams.

14:34:10 Gonzales Bourne exclaims, "It could be yours only for 1,084,050,000.99 Fringe credits!"

14:34:16 Gonzales Bourne says, "Sorry, been watching too mcuh SSN lately."

14:34:16 Katina Faye laughs.

14:34:19 Ali Candan chortles.

14:34:21 Gonzales Bourne says, OOCly, "Much*."

14:34:25 You chuckle.

14:34:25 Melinda Michaels grins.

14:35:15 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person medium transport "Indefatigable".

14:35:15 Ali Candan says, "I'll salvage. Otherwise my sexy grapple gets wasted out there."

14:35:30 Melinda says to Katina, "He is wanting me to be creative. Give me something to tease you over."

14:35:30 Alko Delovega just arrived.

14:35:34 Melinda Michaels smirks.

14:35:38 Alko Delovega sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.

14:35:40 Alko Delovega waves.

14:35:44 Melinda Michaels waves.

14:35:53 You wave to Alko Delovega.

14:35:54 A well-dressed man speaks in hushed tones to a nearby pilot and hands him a small credit chip.

14:36:17 Katina says to Melinda, "Hmm."

14:36:35 Katina says to Melinda, "You're asking the victum for suggestions, ain't that a bit morbid?"

14:36:38 Katina Faye smirks.

14:36:42 You chuckle.

14:36:42 Melinda says to Katina, "It sure is."

14:36:44 Melinda Michaels laughs.

14:36:54 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

14:37:12 Ali Candan says, "Hapless victim."

14:37:22 Melinda Michaels asks, "I guess, Gonzo, Ali and Alko can salvage?"

14:37:30 Gonzales Bourne absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

14:37:34 Gonzales Bourne sprints out.

14:37:34 Ali Candan says, "Sure."

14:37:37 You say, "This is why I claim innocence. That way no one can tease me about anything."

14:37:44 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the vostok-class capsule "Festina Lente" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

14:37:53 Melinda Michaels laughs at you.

14:37:57 You grin.

14:38:35 Ali says to you, "Lily does not say so."

14:38:41 You say, "Yes she does."

14:38:47 Melinda Michaels asks, "Want to bet?"

14:38:49 Melinda Michaels laughs.

14:38:57 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

14:38:59 You say, "No."

14:39:08 Melinda Michaels grins.

14:39:10 You grin.

14:39:11 You laugh.

14:39:32 Ali Candan orders an icy-cold glass of milk.

14:39:34 Ali Candan sits down on a cushy booth seat.

14:39:36 Ali Candan takes a sip of an icy-cold glass of milk.

14:39:55 A pilot at a nearby table excitedly describes a recent find in deep space.

14:40:04 Melinda Michaels speaks into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator:

14:40:05 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hakeem, you about got the felo food sorted?"

14:40:05 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm chocolate chip muffin.

14:40:13 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the three-person flying wing "Stormy Skies".

14:40:19 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Almost, can she put it down after the tonic?"

14:40:26 Melinda Michaels speaks into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator:

14:40:26 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes."

14:40:34 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "One minute."

14:40:43 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm chocolate chip muffin.

14:41:39 Melinda Michaels says, "We're gonna short crew the gunship unless Kim shows up. So, leave WR 3 open and I can swap between there and eng."

14:41:42 Hakeem Oiadip just arrived.

14:41:50 Hakeem Oiadip speaks into his charred metachannel FTL communicator:

14:41:50 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Look at the bowl now."

14:41:55 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Ready."

14:42:12 Melinda says to Hakeem, "Get Katina and Shule. I'll pick up the can."

14:42:22 Alko says to Melinda, "I missed things."

14:42:24 Katina Faye finishes off a warm chocolate chip muffin.

14:42:26 Hakeem Oiadip asks, "For defense?"

14:42:26 Katina Faye orders a cool glass of water.

14:42:29 Melinda says to Alko, "You can salvage?"

14:42:31 Hakeem Oiadip holds Katina Faye's hand, taking her into his group.

14:42:31 Alko Delovega nods.

14:42:32 Katina Faye takes a sip of a cool glass of water.

14:42:35 Hakeem Oiadip holds your hand, taking you into his group.

14:42:35 Ali Candan stands up from a cushy booth seat.

14:42:36 Ali Candan strides out.

14:42:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Head to 285 then."

14:42:40 Alko Delovega nods.

14:42:40 Melinda Michaels just went into the stairway to the garage.

14:42:42 Alko Delovega scrambles to his feet.

14:42:42 Alko Delovega slinks out.
[General Communication] Elissa Rosales transmits, "It's fulll! Yay!"

14:42:43 Katina Faye quickly drains a cool glass of water.

14:42:45 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person medium transport "Full Dive" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

14:42:46 Katina Faye stands up from a cushy booth seat.

14:42:50 You stand up from a comfortable wooden chair.

14:42:51 Hakeem Oiadip asks, "We are on defense?"

14:43:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Stormy Skies, you have clearance to launch. Your allies the League wish you farewell."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:43:56 Katina Faye dances in from the south.

14:43:57 Hakeem Oiadip says into the PA microphone, "Wrong ship, come back."

14:43:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:43:59 Hakeem Oiadip smiles.

14:44:02 Hakeem Oiadip holds your hand, taking you into his group.

14:44:04 Hakeem Oiadip presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

14:44:08 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:44:08 You laugh.

14:44:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:44:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:44:11 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

(11 seconds roundtime.)

14:44:19 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

14:44:20 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Hello there, Stormy Skies! Welcome to home space!"

14:44:21 Katina says to Hakeem, "Thanks."

14:44:21 Wait 8 seconds.

14:44:22 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:45:09 Hakeem Oiadip removes a secondary pilot command access unit from a dark green canvas backpack.

14:45:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Stormbringer, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:45:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:45:17 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Now you guys are free from me."

14:45:18 You say, "Head out to 285."

14:45:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:46:08 You peer north...

14:46:08 
[Starship "Stormbringer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a dark purple leather captain's chair here.

16:05:33 Hakeem Oiadip's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Get something from storage, just checking damage."

16:05:38 [Starship "Stormbringer"; Engineering Room]

16:05:38 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Repairing Battery-Powered Long-Range Watchtower; Docking Bay.

16:06:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:06:27 The damage control computer reports, "Spaceport repairs have been aborted. The starship has left the service area."

16:06:29 [Salvage Op] Melinda Michaels: "Yup."

16:06:30 I don't understand that.

16:06:32 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

16:06:33 You input a series of commands on the damage control computer, entering repair orders for the wormhole drive.

16:07:10 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Someone would like to go to the graves."

16:07:11 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

16:07:11 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

16:07:12 Hakeem Oiadip's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And thanks you both."

16:07:13 The starship has left a unique area of space.

16:07:17 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "No problem."

[Starship "Stormbringer"; Weapons Room Two]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

20:30:29 [Starship "Revenge"; Control Room]

20:30:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

20:38:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive, a dark gray leather captain's chair, and a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go down and out.

20:38:33 You can't go that way.

20:38:45  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee with a large white lightning bolt appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

20:38:45 You are carrying nothing.

20:49:48 Your communicator reports that...

20:49:48

21:31:10 Your communicator reports that...

21:31:10 
At least three recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

21:31:15 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:31:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:31:16 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:31:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:31:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:31:30 The ship is already moving.

21:31:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:31:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:31:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

21:31:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:31:36 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

21:31:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:31:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:31:38 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:31:39 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

21:31:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:31:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:31:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:31:43 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:31:45 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

21:31:45 --

21:31:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

21:31:46 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

21:31:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:32:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:32:24 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:32:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:32:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:32:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:32:41 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:32:41 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:32:42 You scramble to your feet.

21:32:42 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:32:42 You exit the ship.
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

21:32:44 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

21:32:44 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Katina Faye is sitting on a cushy booth seat. Marion Fabre is standing here. Rogue Romano and Mark Washington are sitting on a comfortable wooden chair.
You can go out.

21:32:47 Katina Faye waves to you.

21:32:50 Katina says to you, "Shule!"

21:32:50 You wave.

21:32:53 You say, "Hi all."

21:33:01 Katina says to you, "I wanna fly a beacon."

21:33:01 Rogue Romano says, "Hi Shule."

21:33:13 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:33:15 Rogue Romano finishes off a warm butterscotch cookie.

21:33:17 You say to Katina, "You do?"

21:33:19 Katina says to you, "I've only done a high once, and it was in an avenger with Mel."

21:33:20 Marion Fabre says, "I have used the transport pods before. Not the one on Chetumal."

21:33:28 You grin.

21:33:47 Katina says to you, "I need more practice with it."

21:33:47 You say to Katina, "Just move when they lock."

21:33:51 Katina Faye nods.

21:33:53 You grin.

21:34:12 Katina says to Marion, "I've never been to that um."

21:34:15 You ask, "Everyone here want to go on beacons?"

21:34:16 Katina Faye looks at Rogue Romano thoughtfully.

21:34:21 Katina says to Rogue, "How do you say that city again?"

21:34:30 You ask, "Iztapa?"

21:34:32 Katina Faye nods.

21:34:35 Rogue says to Marion, "Well, head to second level of the spaceport there. Take northern exit and follow that around to plyre road till you see seaview track."

21:34:35 You grin.

21:34:37 Rogue Romano nods.

21:34:41 Rogue Romano says, "Ixtapa."

21:34:48 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person Accord gemini "Endless Melody".

21:35:06 Katina says to you, "I've never done one in a beacon though."

21:35:14 Katina says to you, "I mean gunship."

21:35:17 You grin.

21:35:21 You say, "We can change that."

21:35:30 Katina says to you, "I'll be super nervous though."

21:35:41 You say to Katina, "If you weren't, I'd be worried."

21:35:44 You grin.

21:35:46 Katina Faye grins.

21:35:59 You say, "Hell, I still get nervous and you don't want to now how many evasions I have."

21:36:04 You say, "Know."

21:36:10 Katina Faye says, "Hmm."

21:36:21 Katina Faye says, "I'll probably get beat up I presume."

21:36:47 Katina Faye says, "But I'm feeling daring, and you have to face your fears one day, so."

21:36:48 You say, "We can start you in a standard and then go for a high depending on how it goes and how you feel."

21:36:51 Katina Faye shrugs.

21:36:52 Marion Fabre says, "I want to run a weapon room."

21:36:54 Katina Faye nods to you.

21:37:05 You ask, "Ok, who all is up for beacons?"

21:37:11 You glance around at your surroundings.

21:37:13 Rogue Romano shakes her head.

21:37:27 Mark Washington says, "I'll do one."

21:37:33 You say, "Ok."

21:37:36 You say, "Need two more."

21:37:48 Rogue Romano says, "May wan ask Bryan and Hakeem. They tried crewin' a while ago with no interest."

21:37:53 You nod. "I know."

21:37:55 Katina Faye says, "Yeah I wasn't feeling well back then."

21:38:02 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

21:38:03 Katina Faye says, "Had to rest for a couple minutes."

21:38:03 You say, "Ok, let's make our way over to New Earth."

21:38:09 Katina Faye stands up from a cushy booth seat.

21:38:09 You say, "Those who are interested."

21:38:12 Mark Washington stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

21:38:14 Rogue Romano says into her purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Shule is lookin' for beaconers if you boys are interested."

21:38:16 Mark Washington puts a copy of "League Ships and Upgrades 2317 Edition" in a chocolate brown canvas satchel.

21:38:23 Mark Washington closes a chocolate brown canvas satchel.

21:38:25 Katina Faye says, "They're on tesla now."

21:38:27 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Two for beacons."

21:38:28 Marion Fabre just went into the stairway to the garage.

21:38:31 Rogue Romano says, "I know."

21:38:41 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the one-person cargo hauler "Velourian Dreams" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

21:38:42 You say, "See you guys over there."

21:38:45 You wave.

21:38:50 Rogue Romano waves.

21:38:50 Katina Faye waves.

21:38:52 Mark Washington waves.

21:38:53 Katina Faye dances out.

21:38:53 [Tactical Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Me."

21:38:58 The two-person Accord gemini "Celestial Alhena" and the one-person cargo hauler "Bessy" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
Aurora Patrick is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

21:39:01 Mark Washington ambles in from the doorway to the pilot lounge.

21:39:01 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

21:39:03 The one-person cargo hauler "Bessy" rises smoothly off the ground and accelerates rapidly toward space.

21:39:04 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "New Earth please."

21:39:06 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

21:39:07 Jada Nelson exits from the two-person Accord gemini "Celestial Alhena".

21:39:07 You key in a transport of Firestorm to your location.

21:39:07 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:39:08 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:39:08 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:39:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:39:10 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:39:11 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:39:12 [Tactical Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Count me in."

21:39:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

21:39:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:39:17 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And full."

21:39:22 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Endless Melody" has launched from Old Earth.

21:39:24 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "New Earth lounge."

21:39:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:39:26 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Peregrine Falcon" has jumped into the sector.

21:39:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:39:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:39:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:39:29 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Hello there, Peregrine Falcon! Welcome to home space!"

21:39:31 [Tactical Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Ok on my way."

21:39:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:39:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:39:35 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Reality" has launched from Old Earth.

21:39:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:39:35 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:39:36 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:40:02 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Reality" has jumped into the sector.

21:40:05 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Reality! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

21:40:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:40:09 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:40:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:40:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:40:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:40:24 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:40:24 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:40:25 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:40:26 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:40:26 You exit the ship.

21:41:04 Jada Nelson just arrived.

21:41:04 Marion Fabre nods to you.

21:41:10 Jada Nelson says, "Hi."

21:41:16 Mark Washington just arrived.

21:41:16 Katina Faye smiles at Jada Nelson.

21:41:20 Katina says to Jada, "Hello."

21:41:25 Jada Nelson says, "How's it going."

21:41:30 Marion says to you, "I want to run a weapon room. Is it okay?"

21:41:30 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the scout "White Eagle" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

21:41:33 You say, "Oops, 'oops, we have one too many."

21:41:37 Your communicator reports that...

21:41:37 
At least five recently active pilots are relaxing at New Earth; Pilot Lounge.
At least two recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

21:41:45 Jada Nelson says, "I'll stay back."

21:41:56 Jada Nelson waves.

21:41:57 Jada Nelson jogs out.

21:41:58 Kim Saunders just arrived.

21:42:00 You wave.

21:42:03 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's a Marion."

21:42:09 [General Communication] Bryan Stout whistles.

21:42:13 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person Accord gemini "Endless Melody" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

21:42:23 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sorry Jada. Next time."

21:42:26 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

21:42:33 You hold Kim Saunders's hand, taking her into your group.

21:42:36 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Wait what."

21:44:20 [Tactical Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Me to."

21:44:23 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

21:44:23 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Katina Faye, Marion Fabre, Mark Washington, and Kim Saunders are standing here.

21:44:56 Katina smiles shyly.

21:44:56 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Will be chetumal then."

21:44:58 Kim Saunders says, "I will."

21:45:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:45:01 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

21:45:08 You say, "And all of you, please leave room 3 open."

21:45:09 [Tactical Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Be there in a sec."

21:45:18 Mark Washington nods.

21:45:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, you'll probably want a light transport. You can pick them up in ugh. I can never say the name right Charise."

21:45:23 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person cargo hauler "The Gimbled Ghost" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

21:45:25 You ask, "All ready?"

21:45:28 Katina Faye nods.

21:45:28 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Artifacing at the bubble. I just call it bubbleing."

21:45:31 Mark Washington says, "Let's go."

21:45:32 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Miscomm."

21:45:37 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

21:45:37 You can go up.
Kim Saunders, Mark Washington, Marion Fabre, and Katina Faye followed you.

21:45:41 Board what?

21:45:42 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Artifacting at the bubble. I just call it bubbleing."

21:45:43 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

21:45:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You do need the full pilots license for that though, I don't believe cadets can get such a ship?"

21:45:54 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Airlock]

21:45:54 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Kim Saunders, Mark Washington, Marion Fabre, and Katina Faye followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:45:55 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]

21:45:55 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a gray leather captain's chair, and a large leather couch here.

21:45:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh. My bad yeah."

21:46:01 You disband your group.

21:46:04 Kim Saunders strides south.

21:46:05 Mark Washington ambles south.

21:46:05 You say, "Stations."

21:46:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not sure about that."

21:46:10 Marion Fabre walks south.

21:46:10 Load what?

21:46:16 You remove a decoy beacon from a leather briefcase.

21:46:19 You load a decoy beacon into a decoy beacon launcher.

21:46:21 You say, "There."

21:46:22 Katina Faye says to you, "You'll have to auto vector for me."

21:46:25 You nod.

21:46:26 You say, "I can."

21:46:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Do you think they qualify for maybe a storage extender at least?"

21:46:30 Katina Faye grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

21:46:30 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:46:35 Katina Faye uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:46:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Praying Mantis, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:46:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:46:41 Katina Faye says to you, "The torus?"

21:46:42 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 597! Welcome to home space!"

21:46:44 You nod.

21:46:47 You say, "Yep."

21:46:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:46:54 Katina Faye presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:46:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:46:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:46:57 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

21:47:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:47:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:47:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:47:03 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

21:47:14 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

21:47:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:47:19 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 941" has jumped out of the sector.

21:47:28 You say to Katina Faye, "Now be ready to move as soon as the ships jump in in case there is a rapid."

21:47:32 The starship transitions into another sector.

21:47:33 Via general sector communication, AEU Battle-Scanning Debris-Burning Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There are currently no active decoy beacons in surrounding sectors."

21:47:36 Katina Faye nods.

21:47:39 Katina Faye asks, "Want me to launch?"

22:15:22 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]

22:15:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a gray leather captain's chair, and a large leather couch here.
Katina Faye is sitting on a large leather couch. Marion Fabre is standing here.

22:16:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:16:20 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I'm not trying tobe rude by making everyone leave the CR. It's just that Katina doesn't get credit for a high beacon if we're present in the CR when the beacon is launched."

22:16:34 Marion Fabre's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It is your ship isn't it?"

22:16:40 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "It is."

22:16:48 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:16:50 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

22:16:50 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "But I'm just saying,  I'm not trying to be a jerk."

22:16:56 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Shule's no jerk."

22:16:57 Marion Fabre's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's not rude to give directions."

22:17:07 Marion Fabre walks in from below.

22:17:08 Marion Fabre tries to throw some faerie dust, but finds the jar quite empty.

22:17:11 Marion Fabre exclaims, "Dust!"

22:31:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:31:29 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ug."

22:31:29 Marion Fabre's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No more."

22:31:32 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "You did great1."

22:31:34 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That last hit just took out a failsafe."

22:31:38 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm sorry."

22:31:41 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Corridor]

22:31:41 You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

22:31:42 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]

22:31:42 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a gray leather captain's chair, and a large leather couch here.
Katina Faye is sitting on a large leather couch.
You can go south and out.

22:31:50 You say, "Don't worry about it. You did great."

22:31:52 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

22:31:53 Katina Faye says, "Almost did it without breaking."

22:31:53 Average Starship Damage: 3%

22:31:53 
Hull damage failsafes remaining: 40%, 60%, 80%, and 97%

22:31:54 You hear a brief high-pitched hum as the engineer effects swift repair of a component.

22:32:00 You hear a sharp clank from the hull somewhere near you.

22:32:09 You grin at Katina Faye. "Next time you will."

22:32:10 Marion Fabre's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I shot it."

22:32:11 The ship jerks sharply as its lasers are fired.

22:32:13 Katina Faye smiles.

22:32:20 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "A bit of turret and drive damage, hull about 16 percent or so, and first failsafe."

22:32:22 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

22:32:25 You lift a small plastic cover and press a green button.

22:32:26 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.
A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are powered down.

22:32:32 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

22:32:35 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "People up for one more?"

22:32:39 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nice flying, Catina, and... it happens."

22:32:49 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Why not."

22:32:58 You say to Katina, "Up for flying one more?"

22:33:03 Katina Faye says, "Sure."

22:33:03 Marion Fabre's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am all out fairy dust, but I am still in costume."

22:33:08 Mark Washington's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I gotta rest for now. You guys mind dropping me back off at new earth?"

22:33:11 You say, "Ok, let's fix that failsafe."

22:33:13 Katina Faye nods.

22:33:21 You hear a sharp clank from the hull somewhere near you.

22:33:22 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Oh, ok."

22:33:23 Katina says to you, "Can I call for one for beacon?"

22:33:26 You say, "Sure."

22:33:28 You must switch to autopilot before engaging AutoVector.

22:33:29 Katina Faye asks, "Gunship?"

22:33:30 A small light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches on, while a similar light next to the word MANUAL switches off.

22:33:31 You nod.

22:33:33 You hear a brief high-pitched hum as the engineer effects swift repair of a component.

22:33:34 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

22:33:37 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:33:39 Katina Faye speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

22:34:08 The starship transitions into another sector.

22:34:10 Via general sector communication, AEU Battle-Scanning Debris-Burning Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There is an active decoy beacon one sector Galactic Northwest."

22:34:26 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

22:34:28 The starship transitions into another sector.

22:34:28 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

22:34:29 Katina Faye says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Thanks Mel."

22:34:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:34:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:34:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:34:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:34:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:34:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:34:39 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:34:46 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Praying Mantis! Welcome to home space!"

22:34:51 Say to whom?

22:34:53 Katina Faye says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "New earth."

22:35:05 You say to Katina, "Congrats on your first high gunship beacon."

22:35:05 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 597" has jumped into the sector.

22:35:06 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

[Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

23:05:19 Kim Saunders strides in from the south.

23:05:20 You chuckle.

23:05:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:05:26 You are credited with 2,580,591.46 AEU credits of bounty.

23:05:31 Katina Faye stands up from a large leather couch.

23:05:31 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:05:33 Melinda says to you, "Are you kidding? She has my wine. I have to keep her on my good side."

23:05:33 Katina Faye waves.

23:05:35 Melinda Michaels laughs.

23:05:38 Katina Faye dances out.

23:05:39 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:05:40 You laugh.

23:05:40 You wave.

23:05:44 Melinda Michaels waves.

23:05:44 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

23:05:46 Melinda Michaels strolls out.

23:05:47 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:05:49 Kim Saunders strides out.

23:05:51 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:05:52 Marion Fabre asks, "Was there anything I could have done better?"

23:05:58 You say, "You did great."

23:06:11 You hug Marion Fabre.

23:06:15 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

23:06:19 You put a secondary pilot command access unit in a leather briefcase.

23:06:21 Marion Fabre asks, "I wasn't being annoying with the fairy costume and dust?"

23:06:24 You say, "Nope."

23:06:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I got reps for you, Shule."

23:06:26 You grin.

23:06:28 Marion Fabre hugs you.

23:06:35 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

23:06:35 Marion Fabre says, "It is a fun costume."

23:06:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Thanks Kim."

23:06:40 You say, "I bet."

23:06:42 You grin.

23:06:45 Marion Fabre asks, "I even got a tiara for it, see?"

23:06:47 Marion Fabre pokes and prods at a sparkling tiara decorated with diamonds.

23:06:54 You exclaim, "Very cute!"

23:06:56 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

23:09:23 You say, "Welcome that is."

23:09:37 Marion Fabre says, "Okay. I have no plans right now."

23:09:40 You grin.

23:09:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:09:42 Marion Fabre says, "So it is fine."

23:09:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Praying Mantis, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:09:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:09:48 You sit down on a large leather couch.

23:09:50 You say, "Have a seat."

23:09:55 You say, "I don't bite."

23:09:55 Marion Fabre sits down on a large leather couch.

23:09:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:14:03 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:14:14 You say to Marion, "Why did you call him useless?"

23:14:26 Oh no! You currently do not have any proteges!

23:14:33 Marion Fabre says, "Because he tried to claim he had no role in leading the AEU pilot corps into the situation it is in now."

23:14:34 Your ship 'Praying Mantis' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:14:43 You say, "Oh."

23:15:15 You say, "Then again, Ather doesn't seem to like many of us."

23:15:26 Marion Fabre says, "He said he had no responsibility to lead, and I asked why we were paying for his ace perks. If he is around just to be a warhorse, we have a navy for that. Aces should lead, or they are useless."

23:15:48 You ask, "I see. And what did he say to that?"

23:15:58 Marion Fabre says, "Oh he called me a child and insulted me."

23:16:04 Marion Fabre says, "Instead of addressing the points."

23:16:12 You shrug. "Sounds like him."

23:16:48 You say, "Well, I'm certainly not an Ace pilot, but I've been known to give good advice a time or two when it comes to combat."

23:17:00 You grin.

23:17:11 Marion Fabre exclaims, "Good!"

23:17:32 You say, "I'm pretty strict on my ships though. Asyou may have seen."

23:17:50 Marion Fabre says, "It is your ship, you give the orders and we should follow them."

23:17:55 You nod.

23:18:14 Marion Fabre

23:18:15 She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and eight inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is very thin with boyish hips and thin calves. She has slender shoulders and very small, perky breasts with inverted lightly tinted nipples. Her abdomen is smooth and punctuated by a tiny navel. More intimately, she has bushy ebony pubic hair and a slender butt. Her face is heart-shaped and beautiful, with a delicate nose and sharp chin. Her lips are soft and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of flawless teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are green and wide. Her shoulder-length, straight hair is ebony and in a bun. She has long clear fingernails. She has a pair of light-catching clear crystal bird barrettes in her hair.
 She is wearing a sparkling tiara decorated with diamonds, a long white faerie dress made of layers of sheer gauzy silk, and a pair of white silk pumps. She is also wearing a sturdy silver canvas backpack and a pair of small white and silver faerie wings made of sparkling silk with trailing edges and delicately curved upward extensions. Her face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

23:18:22 Marion Fabre says, "Things don't work when people don't listen to their leaders."

23:18:53 You say, "Very true."

23:19:12 "You know I can see through that dress?" You grin at Marion Fabre.

23:19:18 Marion Fabre asks, "What?"

23:19:26 Marion glances down at herself.

23:19:30 You chuckle.

23:19:43 Marion blushes bright red.

23:19:53 You say, "It's ok."

23:19:58 Marion lies, "It's a fashion statement."

23:20:03 You say, "I won't flirt with you..."

23:20:07 You say, "Or try not too."

23:20:17 You grin at Marion Fabre.

23:20:30 Marion Fabre says, "No one said anything the whole time I was going around in costume."

23:20:53 You say, "Well, we're used to various states of undress during beacons."

23:20:59 Marion Fabre asks, "Really?"

23:21:12 You say, "Some pilots used to encourage toples gunning."

23:22:14 Marion plucks at a long white faerie dress made of layers of sheer gauzy silk.

23:22:21 Marion Fabre says, "This thing doesn't hide anything."

23:22:25 You say, "Nope."

23:22:27 You grin.

23:22:46 Shule cautiously reaches out towards your dress, "May I?"

23:23:04 Marion Fabre says, "May you? Okay."

23:23:22 Shule brushes his hand along your dress, "I like the fabric."

23:23:44 Marion Fabre asks, "Do you want to try it on?"

23:23:49 Shule respectfully settles his hands back in his lap.

23:24:25 You grin. "Ummm, then it wouldn't hide anything on me."

23:24:28 You laugh.

23:24:36 Marion Fabre exclaims, "It doesn't hide anything on me!"

23:24:58 You say, "True."

23:25:12 You ask, "Just umm, don't tell anyone we di this?"

23:25:23 Marion Fabre says, "Okay."

23:25:32 Marion Fabre stands up from a large leather couch.

23:25:35 Marion Fabre slides a long white faerie dress made of layers of sheer gauzy silk off.

23:25:35 You stand up from a large leather couch.

23:27:28 Marion Fabre suddenly awakens.

23:27:32 Marion Fabre says, "Ha."

23:27:38 You say, "Oops."

23:27:48 You ask, "Did you want me to change right here?"

23:28:04 Marion Fabre says, "Wherever you like. It is your ship."

23:28:13 You shrug.

23:28:15 You remove all of your clothing, placing it carefully on the ground.

23:28:22 You pull on a long white faerie dress made of layers of sheer gauzy silk.

23:28:28 You grin.

23:28:32 You ask, "So?"
