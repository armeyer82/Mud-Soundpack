The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits
protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of
the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a
view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing
essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a
working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though
the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire
architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.

tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips
and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than
average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and
understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally
part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows,
her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight
hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist,

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches
tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips
and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than
average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and
understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally
part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows,
her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight
hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a
small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit and a pair of white
leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is
also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist,
a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the
side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced
plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect
solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder.
Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Bryan Stout exclaims in a Canadian accent, "Sleep time for me!"

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective
history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By
the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has
spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an
alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First
contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then
the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one
by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five
years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space,
bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this,
and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off
human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has
lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of
it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any
new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that
most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your
species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Happy"; Airlock]
You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. The status lights overhead
are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting Nuclear Rest Station; Docking
Bay. The hatch appears to be locked. A small light near the hatch is dark and
unpowered.
You see an early warning space defense device and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo
chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, Meow the
little calico CatBot, a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the
humanoid service robot, a small purple trash bin, and a Tardick lizard named

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Eatery & Billeting
Nuclear Rest Station; Docking Bay.
