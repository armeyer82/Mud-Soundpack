pa In terms of flying, I used to fly the same way for a while and it worked for
a while, but I've watched people lose their ship, including my own when they
didn't pay attention to locks. So, eventually, I believe that it's important to
pay attention to locks and anticipate them. Just my opinion from my experience.

taken me more than a half hour to get there."

pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the

awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a

a good idea to stay in beacon sectors really."

I went the number of sectors that I was supposed to but can't find the beacon."

An upgrade?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I have upgrades, but he popped
in the sector at the same time as me."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Sarah, where are you?"
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "My thing did a force landing with
the wormhole drive, it was its last hope."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If you mean how I found the rat
so fast, a combination of an Anomaly detector and autovector. You probably can't
get autovector yet, but consider getting an Anomaly detector, it'll tell you
when you enter a sector with an object like a probe."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Sarah, do you need help, and
if so where?"
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "I had to use a escape pod."

old earth."

they started shooting."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Was your ship already
destroyed?"
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "My pod, I launched a rescue pod."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Where is your ship?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If your ship wasn't destroyed,
you could have just flown away with it."

and my hull had been shot a lot to the point that it was toast."

you."

launched a escape pod, its in the dusty reaches."

darilict."

[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Why did you not jump or vector
out?"
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "It had nuthing left of it."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "In future, there's usually
another option."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Even if your wormhole drive is
damaged, you can bolt down a temperary wormhole drive and escape like that."
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "Well I was trieing to shoot them
down."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Jump out before damage gets
too bad."
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "Fuck, I didn' t have one."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "In a cargo hauler, you probably
have no chance against anything bigger than minors unless you get lucky."
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "It was a flitter."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Maybe fighters if you can keep
them from swarming you."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Exactly, you don't fight in
those, you move."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Same deal."
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "I don't even know if I have enough
credits to get a ship."
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "I'l check."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can use the torpedos or
whatever you have on that to do extra damage, but it'll still not be very
effective."
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "I have enough for a flitter but
I'l have like 18000 credits after that and that's not close to enough."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can make more, though."
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "Have 100000025000."
[General Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "What? No."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Have you used your cadet
loan?"

to do?"

or hauling roids, people usually call here or on tactical. You just have to be
around."

salvaging, or fighting."

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Ather, are you lucid?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure?"
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Do you got any plants for rift
speed or battery charge?"
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Or even rift sensors, anything
like that?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Nope! That's all cats."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I have a rift sensor increase
and max reactionless drive velocity increase."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "That's the silver purple yellow
veined one, right? Think that's what you put on my Gem."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, it's purple depressions and
thick yellow veins."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Wonder what I have then, can't
remember."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Oh, wait, looking at it again,
it's what you described."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It probably is the same. Look
at it again."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Yeah, it is."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Did you want another one of
it?"
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Not sure yet. Thinking about
getting a small exploration vessel set up. Weighing my options."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hint: void piercers suck
epically."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Think we're going to go with a
module transport, probably."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Is there a sensor sensor
plant?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "There is."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Not sure who has it."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "I'm thinking that would be our
best bet since we're probably not going to burn through the whole charge anyway
before we get back."
[General Communication] Pilot Aeva Carsen transmits, "Hi all."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Depends on how far you're
going, and whether or not the flow is in your favor."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I've never been one to
encourage sacrificing charge for any reason. That's why I haven't bought any of
those kinds of plants."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Probably only a few days at a
time."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, you do know that a module
transport, with a fienstein only has I think, a day and 12 hours of charge?
Maybe slightly more if you shut down damage control and weapons."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Was going to put a blast
furnace on it."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And even a bit more if you go
buy a thermal reclamation."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Should work, but I still
wouldn't sacrifice the charge when it's so minimal like that."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "So you'd say a sensor/charge
then?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Is that yours or cats?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's cats."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "When you're going to use a ship
with such a small amount of charge on it like a module transport, I'd look to
increase its charge, not decrease it."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in General/Name Changes.
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a
new notice.
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Oh, the sensor/sensor plant
decreases it's charge?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "But it's minimal?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The second part of the sensor
hybrid decreases charge by like, 3-4% or so."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You'd lose about an hour and
change of your charge."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "That doesn't really seem like a
huge problem."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You say that now..."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I suppose experience will teach
you otherwise."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Has it happened to you?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "An hour and change, counting
the recharging that the furnace does?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I haven't let it happen to me."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Cause if not that's more like 6
hours."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Well, I'm just saying, we're
probably only going to be using 2/3 of the total charge, if that. It's not like
we'd be cutting it close."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The furnace doesn't doesn't
make your battery hold more charge, it just recharges it to the amount of charge
that it can hold or as close to it as possible, depending on the type of debris
you put onboard."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And again, depending on the
type of debris you put onboard, it could literally take hours for the furnace to
fully recharge you."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Isn't it raited for three full
recharges, though? If your full recharge is less, it'll provide less power over
all? Or am I misunderstanding."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure it's rated for three full
recharges. Are you guaranteed to find a debris field everytime you need to
recharge, though? Cause I can pretty much guarantee that you're not going to be
able to put enough debris onto the ship for three full recharges."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh I get it."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And if the flow is bad wherever
you are, you can be pretty much caught flat-footed."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Hmm..."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Yeah that kind of throws a gear
in the plan."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Trust me! I'm not trying to
make money off of you or anything! The types of plants I'm recommending you get,
I don't sell."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "I'm just suffering from a lack
of information, I see why you're right."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There are some people who like
that high energy capacity low output stupid battery thing, that might be better
for what you're trying to do. It'll hurt your systems a bit, but it will give
you a considerable amount of charge. Something I'd neve ruse, but you might find
it will suit you."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You install that though, and
you can't install the blast furnace."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "And actually, I guess I can't
get a blast furnace anyway now. So that's out."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It is 2000 exploration points!"
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Annoyed now."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Well, I can almost get the
solar panels."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's doable, taking a module
transport out to Feng Wo. Especially since you can fill it with charging
stations."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You'll need a navigator,
though."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Someone with a star chart?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And 50 golden taels."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes! A navigator!"
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Fuck."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If you could tell me what you
were trying to do, I might be able to offer some suggestions which might prove
workable."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Even if you'd rather put it in
a letter, or meet privately so as not to publicize it if you don't want to do
all that."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Will you be around in half an
hour?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Very probably."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "I'm rifting back from the
bubble at the moment."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "And yeah, I'm probably giving
everyone a headache by now with my questions. I'll check up with you then."

[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi all."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Hi."
[General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Might have another mystery
plant!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "What's it look like?"
[General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "A pair of intertwined stalks with
thick puffy leaves."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hmm."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Nope, don't recall puffy
leaves."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It will probably be some sort
of resistance plant, though."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Did you every figure out that
one plant, Ather? The one no one could figure out what it did?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, we eventually figured it
out. They had to do with weapon resistances."
[General Communication] Sol Sterling transmits, "Nice."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh, I don't care overly much
about weapon resistances. I destroyed them."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Left them for other orgs to
have and grow."
