00:16 [Newbie] Michael Calaway: Uh speed has never done anything for me, strange.

00:16 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: Speed is a rather small factor. You either move at 6 seconds/unit, 4 seconds/unit with relitivity drive upgrade. 8/unit in some situations, such as nebulas.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 251270; Starship Parking Facility.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table.

14:23 [Apartment 251270; Master Bedroom] (indoors) (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread)
You see a cozy little bedroom with carpet floors and drywall walls. The walls are painted red. A glass rose with a soft orange light inside is casting a warm soft orange light throughout the room.
You see two large curved antique cherry bedside tables, an antique black wrought iron tiered candelabra holding four slender crimson taper candles, a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread, a large soft red and white heart shaped area rug, a large marble fireplace with a stone hearth and a cherrywood mantel, two overstuffed bright white suede recliners, a red heart-shaped air freshener, a small bamboo bassinet lined with ivory soft padding and covered with a sunshine yellow canopy, and a hologram of a flower garden projected in the middle of the room here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread) here, sleeping.
You can go east.

21:50 [Apartment 251270; Master Bedroom] (indoors) (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread)
You see a cozy little bedroom with carpet floors and drywall walls. The walls are painted red. A glass rose with a soft orange light inside is casting a warm soft orange light throughout the room.
You see two large curved antique cherry bedside tables, an antique black wrought iron tiered candelabra holding four slender crimson taper candles, a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread, a large soft red and white heart shaped area rug, a large marble fireplace with a stone hearth and a cherrywood mantel, two overstuffed bright white suede recliners, a red heart-shaped air freshener, a small bamboo bassinet lined with ivory soft padding and covered with a sunshine yellow canopy, and a hologram of a flower garden projected in the middle of the room here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on a large canopy bed with a white satin curtain and a crimson bedspread) here, sleeping.
You can go east.

21:50 You lean in toward Miriam Valleris and gently kiss her lips.
