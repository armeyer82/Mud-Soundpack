She is wearing a pair of black snake skin stiletto heels on her feet. She is wearing a white Swarovski Crystal belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a small keyring, a compact violet Lore computer, a black spacesuit storage bag, a fuzzy black backpack with black thin straps and a black heart-shaped front pocket, a violet ammunition container, a gold charm bracelet, a sparkling white Swarovski Crystal bracelet, a gold Alliance High Guard command charm on a long gold chain, a metallic gray metafrequency communication pin, a black archaeological artifact storage container, and a red rolled toolkit.

00:05 Pippa Lancaster

00:05 She is a member of the Hale alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This lithe woman appears to be in her early twenties and stands 5 feet and 4 inches tall with a medium bust size. Her heart-shaped face bears a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a red rose in her long, champagne blonde hair, which is wavy. She has expressive sky blue eyes with an upturned nose above white, straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted a normal stance.
For a top, she is wearing a form-fitting black soft leather vest with fringe along the bottom. For a bottom, she is wearing a black mini skirt over a pair of black lace thong underwear. She is wearing a pair of black snake skin stiletto heels on her feet. She is wearing a white Swarovski Crystal belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a small keyring, a compact violet Lore computer, a black spacesuit storage bag, a fuzzy black backpack with black thin straps and a black heart-shaped front pocket, a violet ammunition container, a gold charm bracelet, a sparkling white Swarovski Crystal bracelet, a gold Alliance High Guard command charm on a long gold chain, a metallic gray metafrequency communication pin, a black archaeological artifact storage container, and a red rolled toolkit.
She is carrying nothing.

00:05 You whisper "And flip up your mini skirt when I spank you?" to Pippa Lancaster.

00:05 Pippa Lancaster says, "Mmm hmm... and slide your hands over my smooth thighs"

You receive 1,200,000.00 credits for successfully piloting a mission.

00:06 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the one-person fighter "Quack Attack", the five-person transverser "Astraeus' Odyssey", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Thanatos" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, Beta the droid, Mjolnir the droid, Strike the droid, Sinister the droid, Booboo the droid, and a long sleeve black leather body suit with a red neckline and sleeves here.

00:56 ["Fire And Ice" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black leather captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a red cotton polo with thin white stripes, a form-fitting black soft leather vest with fringe along the bottom, a black mini skirt, a pair of faded blue jeans with metal studs around the back pockets, a pair of white cotton tapered boxers, and a pair of black lace thong underwear here.
You see Pippa Lancaster here.
You can go south, down, and out.

02:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:42 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

02:42 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

02:42 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

02:42 There are no ships here.

02:42 The ship is already moving.

02:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:42 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:42 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:42 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Flight control in Polaris, somebody's firing sensor interruption pulses out there!"

02:42 You will now be able to use non-numeric manual navigation commands. Please see HELP ALTERNATIVE MANUAL NAVIGATION for information about potential pitfalls.

02:42 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:42 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:42 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:42 > (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has initiated an intrasector slip.

02:42 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

02:42 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:42 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

02:42 > (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has left the sector.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:43 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

02:43 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

02:43 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:43 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:43 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:43 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

02:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:43 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:43 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

Player-owned Space Stations, Moons, and Planets
--------------------------------------------------
PLANETS, MOONS, AND SPACESTATIONS:
Q: What do I need to get a planet, moon, or spacestation?
A: For spacestations, you need 10 billion credits and 10000 points. For moons, you need 20 billion credits and 15000 points. For planets, you need 30 billion credits and 25000 points. You also pay additional fees for each room you add.
Q: Where can I put my spacestation, planet, or moon?
A: In any sector, including places out of local space, except sector 24, sector 15, sector 12, sector 9, sector 13, sector 19, sector 0, sector 30, sector 115, sector 14 and sector 32. These sectors are subject to change and can be added to at any time.
Q: What can these fine places have?!
A: They can have an optional pool, an optional hot tub, and an optional private garage. You also may have a security center which allows you to control flight control and monitor rooms on the station, planet, or moon. You can also have a room that monitors the sector around your station, planet, or moon. Additionally, you're allowed to have five custom item stores for a station, seven custom item stores for a moon, and nine custom item stores for a planet. Any additional stores will have to be a tradesman item. Custom item stores are defined as stores with special clothing, food or other collectable items. You may have a transport pod as long as the station, p
04:23 lanet, or moon is not out of local space. Player-owned space stations, planets, and moons cannot contain facilities that allow for point transfers to take place, including artifact research centers, passenger transport facilities, etc. Stations, planets and moons cannot be self-contained. This means you cannot design a station that eliminates your need to travel to other planets to obtain specific services or goods. Example: starship registries.
Q: Can my station be armed?!?!
A: Sorry, no.
Q: Can I keep people out of my station, planet, or moon?
A: You can control flight control which will deny docking to a whole alliance, everybody but owners and caretakers, or specific ships based on your choice. If landing is disabled to all, even the ITPN station becomes non-functional.
Q: ITPN Stations??! Oh my oh my! What do they entail?!
A: All private space stations, moons and planets are required to have an ITPN station on them. These stations cannot be past a security checkpoint, meaning that everybody has to be able to get to them. ITPN stations may have only a single destination. The destination is determined by the sector that your private space station, moon or planet is in. If there is already a planet, moon or station in the sector you are building in, your ITPN destination goes to that location. Otherwise, the ITPN pod will go to the sector hub. That's Pax for sectors 1 through 20, and the ITPN hub in sector 33 for sec
04:23 tors 21 through 40. An example would be if a person build a moon in sector 31. There is a planet there with an ITPN station already, so the one on the private moon would go to that planet, which would then go to the hub. Private space stations, moons and planets not in a numbered sector can not have an ITPN station.

15:26 1.) What is your name?
Tibo Beauchene
--------------------------------------------------
2.) How would you rate your combat abilities? Poor, average, excellent?
Average
--------------------------------------------------
3.) Do you regularly participate in High Guard missions to protect known space?
yes
--------------------------------------------------
4.) What would the primary purpose of a battlecruiser be in your fleet?
I would use it to run missions and in defense during missions.
I would use it to run missions and to assist in defense during invasions.
--------------------------------------------------
5.) What do you intend to name your battlecruiser?
Triton
--------------------------------------------------
6.) Imagine this hypothetical situation and describe how you would handle it. You're flying through uncharted space in your battlecruiser and you happen upon a lone Praelor starship. What do you do?
I would scan the ship to ensure it is not Krenelia. If it is Ontanka and I am in a combat type ship, I would fight it. Otherwise, unless it interdicts, I'd leave it alone.
--------------------------------------------------
7.) Consider this situation: Praelor are invading known space and you find yourself on a planet with only two others. Your only option is to launch into a sector filled with Praelor who are probably swarming around the planet just waiting for you to launch. What do you do?
I would launch and fight the Praelor until either my BC is destroyed or additional help arrives.
--------------------------------------------------
8.) Your friend has been kidnapped during an invasion and is currently being held prisoner on someone else's ship. You have a full crew together, and you could easily retrieve your friend. Do you stay and fight the Praelor, or do you rescue your friend?
I would definitely stay and fight the Praelor.
--------------------------------------------------
9.) You're being continually harassed over the communicator by someone. They aren't causing you any physical harm, just insulting you. One day, you're in your battlecruiser and you see him salvaging. Do you attack him?
no
--------------------------------------------------
10.) Have you ever operated a starship or any other vehicle under the influence of a drug such as alcohol?
no
--------------------------------------------------
11.) Have you ever committed an act of random violence against an innocent creature, such as a proboscis monkey?
no
--------------------------------------------------
12.) Are you willing to have your battlecruiser destroyed in the defense of humanity?
yes
--------------------------------------------------
13.) And finally, you are free to make any additional comments here.
I would feel honored to be able to purchase and operate such an amazing starship and thank you for your consideration.

15:40 ["Song of Dragon Fire Lightning" Weapons Room 2] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret here.
You can go south.

15:40 Kerry Calderon's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "wr 1"

15:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:40 [Chatter] Bob Smith yelps, "My ears..."

15:40 #$#soundpack social | yelp | male

15:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:40 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

15:40 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

15:40 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

15:40 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:41 Cody Meynoso's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "does anyone need cords, and you all better say no"

15:41 Leon Thomas's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "hell no"

15:41 A loud rendition of Jingle Bells sounds as green lights twinkle overhead.

15:41 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:41 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

15:41 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from red to yellow.
You hear the gentle hum begin to fade as the weapons power down.

15:41 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

15:41 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

15:41 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

15:41 Quintavious Thomas's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "me"

15:41 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

15:41 Cody Meynoso's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "suck it"

15:41 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

15:41 #$#soundpack social | laugh | male

15:41 Quintavious Thomas laughs over the intercom.

15:41 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

15:41 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:41 [General Communication] Patric Avery transmits, "Still have spots?"

15:41 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:41 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:41 [General Communication] Quintavious Thomas transmits, "Filled buddy."

15:41 [General Communication] Leon Thomas transmits, "We are subwarping to 3 3 3 now."

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.
You see Dee the droid, Tausha the droid, Yowl the droid, Boomer the droid, Scrappy the droid, Karalyn the droid, Cletus the droid, Sameer the droid, Jessicapops the droid, Delta the droid, Chander the droid, Dixy the droid, and a Proboscis Monkey here.

The entire area has been bulldozed to create a mostly flat landing site. The smell of fresh soil couples with the stench of hot starships and the scent of industrial chemicals. In the distance, you can see the gleaming Alliance High Guard Complex jutting into the sky. Off to the side, you notice two pieces of recently constructed equipment. The first appears to be an enormous planetary defense laser of some kind. The second facility is slightly less comprehensible, though the surplus of refined cardenium stored around it suggests it's a power generation facility. There is a short path a brisk walk to the south and evidence suggests that a massive concrete pit has been dug a short way off. Judging by the amount of ships being lifted by cranes, it is likely a garage facility of some sort.
You see the four-person short-range troop transport "Magnanimous", the eight-person gunship "Auribus Teneo Lupum", and the three-person antagonizer "Vae Victis" landed here.
You see Eeky the droid, Tut the droid, Monkey the droid, a bright orange sanitation drone, a slim sanitation drone, and a glowing blue sanitation drone here.

16:19 Leon Thomas's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "getting mission"

16:19 [Short-range Communication] Cody Meynoso transmits, "What are the odds, that we get the same docking bay 3 times in a roe?"

16:19 [Short-range Communication] Quintavious Thomas transmits, "Ah damn."

16:19 [Short-range Communication] Leon Thomas transmits, "I didn't even notice."

16:19 [Short-range Communication] Leon Thomas transmits, "Makes it easy."

16:19 [Short-range Communication] James Johnson transmits, "Cool. Arm me with a hatch bomb so I can crack it."

16:19 [Short-range Communication] Quintavious Thomas transmits, "Only crack you cracking, is."

16:19 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

16:19 Quintavious Thomas's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "i was in 4"

16:20 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:20 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:20 Leon Thomas's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "alright! lets rock it!"

16:20 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:20 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

16:20 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

16:20 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

16:20 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

16:20 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

16:20 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

16:20 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

16:20 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

16:20 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:20 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:20 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

17:41 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

17:41 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

17:41 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

17:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:41 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

17:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall.

18:12 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

18:12 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

18:12 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

18:12 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

18:13 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

18:13 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

18:13 Melissa Castillo's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "o i am"

18:13 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

18:13 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

18:13 #$#soundpack social | chortles | male

18:13 Cody Meynoso chortles over the intercom.

18:13 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

18:13 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

18:13 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

18:13 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

18:13 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

18:13 The sensors are unable to pinpoint the starship's current coordinates.

18:13 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

18:13 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

18:13 Current coordinates: 8, 16, 5

18:14 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the five-person transverser "Astraeus' Odyssey", the ten-person battlecruiser "Thanatos", the ten-person battlecruiser "Solidus", the six-person sentinel "Song of Dragon Fire Lightning", and the one-person Hale runabout "Death-Strike" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, Beta the droid, Mjolnir the droid, Strike the droid, Sinister the droid, Booboo the droid, and a long sleeve black leather body suit with a red neckline and sleeves here.

21:19 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the four-person surveyor "Ools Storage" powered down here.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion" and the one-person fighter "Will of Fire" landed here.
You see Gee the droid, Larry the droid, Yelp the droid, Cyrax the droid, Cylinder the droid, Torri the droid, Ketemmex the droid, Ramzi the droid, Angela the droid, Gamma the droid, Nia the droid, Jade the droid, and Shade the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, and south.

22:33 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:33 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

22:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

22:33 You're already sitting down.

22:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has launched from Rolukssica.
You're already buckled in.

22:33 There are no ships here.

22:33 Get what?

22:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:33 You remove a droid remote titled "Empanda" from a sleek black leather carrying case.

22:33 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:33 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:33 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:33 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has left the sector.

22:33 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:33 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:33 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 14, 8."

22:33 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:33 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)

22:33 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:33 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:33 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.
The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

22:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

22:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:34 #$#soundpack_pong

22:34 #$#soundpack_lag 185

22:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:34 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has docked with Pax (Neutral Docking Station).

22:34 You put a droid remote titled "Empanda" in a sleek black leather carrying case.

The reinforced steel of this massive landing site gleams in the multitude of lights glittering from the massive spaceport tower to the north. The curved structure spears up towards the sky, its exterior marked and colored with a vast array of murals and messages. Its many windows glow with blazing light, and enormous colored spotlights cast their beams down from the very top of the tower. A sculpted granite archway leads into the spaceport, and above it is a gold embossed plaque with engraved letters which read, Miriani Spirit tower. A lighted sign directing pilots to the spaceport garage is visible off to the left above a set of gleaming metal stairs which lead downward. In the far distance, at the gated edge of the landing site, there appears to be a small brick structure with several people gathered around it.
