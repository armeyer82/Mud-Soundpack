Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed.

Author: Squidmind
Posted: Fri May 26 21:45:54 2017 UTC

You're confusing the chicken with the egg, here -- expeditions were happening before expedition ships existed as such, and the alliances that showed the most initiative here were given exploration technology. This is for the same reason that the Fringe have gained a warship and the AEU gained a station-building ship: we try to react to what the characters in each alliance do the most. One AEU player did buck the trend and led an expedition despite a very public withholding of support from the rest of his alliance, and so he was individually given new, very useful exploration technology. This was intended as a bit of positive reinforcement, as an example of what comes of showing initiative.

The Explorer Corps, too, was an attempt at positive reinforcement, but no one seemed interested in rising to the challenge. In any case, its fate was decided along with the election. Best was very clearly not interested in exploration and he got the vote.

We apparently missed the longer post from kayden, so let's address some of the additional points in it now.

1: This has been touched upon, but the alliances respond to what their civilian pilots do - since players in the League are the ones who focused on exploration, the League is going to put more effort into developing technologies to exploit that.  Likewise, with the AEU players SAYING they want to explore but not actually doing so - for several years - the AEU is not going to work on exploration technology.  Instead, the focus shifted to stationbuilding, and with the election of Best things have shifted again.

2: When the Explorer's Corps was introduced, the concept was explained - to get in, people had to show they were explorers.  They did not.  As stated in the Squidmind post, with the election of Best, who specifically stood on a platform of no exploration, there was no room for an Explorer's Corps any more.

Staff Error: I'm not sure what you're saying here - that people don't want to give any kind of opinion because the game world reacts to it?  That's kind of the definition of an active roleplaying game and a living world.  If the game world did not react, what would be the point of doing anything within it?  Headlines are just that - headlines.  Most are not intended to be the entire NPC world viciously attacking the pilots, often they are repeating verbatim things a pilot themselves have said - only tabloids make things up, the other sources and affiliates have biases but will always have a grain of truth (often much more) in their statements.

Things only happen if players actively do them - the worst aspects of the AEU situation took place because people chose to do nothing, repeatedly, after discussion both IC and OOC, where they knew that taking action would make things better while not acting would make things much worse.  The low-level distaste for civilian pilots and the civilian corps as a whole has very little to do with the reactions to the things the player characters do themselves in very public ways.

All votes from the AEU playerbase went to Best and the National Patriots in the election.  We didn't force this, it was chosen by the players.  But why is there no way to combat it?  We have helped to influence nothing.  We gave multiple choices and the PLAYERS decided how the AEU was to be seen by others.  Are you saying we should only ever offer perfect choices?  But then there's no choice at all, you're just along for the ride.  Removing the arrow from production is part of an ongoing plotline and is based on the policies of the National Patriots as stated during the election.  People knew what was likely to happen, so it didn't take place out o
00:42:50 f nowhere.

Once again: you do not need a galleon, the best battery, the best sensors, the best grid, infinite vending machine food, and extra beds in order to set up an expedition.

Player Error: We don't really have a comment in response to what you say here beyond that inaction is almost always the worst possible choice in any given situation.  

The AEU doesn't NEED to do anything - it is certainly not required to return to being the alliance of exploration.  Attitudes and cultures shift and change over time.  We have spent seven real life years trying to push the players of the AEU into keeping the AEU the alliance of exploration, and have come to realise that we really shouldn't be trying to force the issue.  The alliance will be what it will be, based on how people act within it.

We are somewhat curious as to what you envisage the staff could have done to stop the non-AEU alliance players from exploring.  What do you think we could do now, and what would be the result, if we outright stepped in to stop non-AEU players from exploring when they want to?

02:16:32 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

02:18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Ather was collecting an unmanned pickup for the Asteroid Processor that I'm getting ready to build for 285."

02:19:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes, yes. I figured. I just wanted to make sure I didn't need to reload anything onto the ship for now."

02:19:32 Blueberry the old hefty violet feathered felo wanders out.

02:34:33 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

02:38:44 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 148,668.43 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

02:39:33 Blueberry the old hefty violet feathered felo wanders in from the airlock.

02:44:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok charging station is dealt with and I built the asteroid processor for 285."

02:47:33 Blueberry the old hefty violet feathered felo wanders south.

02:48:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, cool."

02:48:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "When does the processor for 285 need to be deployed?"

02:49:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "In about 6 or 7 hours. It may be too late for either of us so we can either take it out about a half hour before we go to bed or just wait until we wake up."

02:50:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, ok. I can try to take care of it when I wake up."

02:50:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok well whomever wakes up first can do it."

02:50:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That works."

02:50:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup."

02:50:46 [MTTS] usfolks: I don't exactly want to put this on the newbie channel, but does any one know whether or not it's appropriate to mention specific books available on the market on the help channel? Especially if your char wrote them? I don't want to get in trouble for doing it...kind of seems like a plug to me somehow.

02:51:19 [MTTS] something: Just tell them to ask around in character, I'd think.

02:51:29 [MTTS] atherj: It's relevant to the topic in question, I don't see anything wrong with it, personally.

02:51:51 [MTTS] Butchulla: I usually just tell people to ask IC about books relating to that subject, if there is one.

02:51:57 [MTTS] usfolks: That's what I was thinking, but I didn't want it to look like I was influencing a char to buy something that benefitted my char.

02:52:12 [MTTS] atherj: We do give out limited in-character information on the newbie channel. Sometimes we might say "you can find out more in character", but we definitely try to answer their questions to the best of our abilities.

02:52:49 [MTTS] usfolks: Considering my char usually gives them away to cadets, it is impossible at the moment to do.

02:53:06 [MTTS] canpher has left the channel.

03:02:00 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I owe you a flash later."

03:02:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah, you owe me two for that. It was extremely hard work."

03:02:45 [General Communication] Joel Kringle whistles.

03:03:16 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:03:18 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:03:26 Lily Kaise suddenly bashes her spacesuit helmet into your face.

03:03:35 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:03:58 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "Glory to the civilian fleet."

03:05:56 Please enter a valid channel to transmit on.

03:06:00 You put a gentle kiss on Lily Kaise's space suit helmet.

03:06:02 You laugh.

03:06:25 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "Oops."

03:06:26 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

03:06:30 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

03:06:33 Lily Kaise removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

03:06:40 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:06:42 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:06:48 You say, "There, much better."

03:06:56 Lily Kaise nods.

03:07:21 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

03:10:34 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

03:12:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Shule! Please come to accord command."

03:12:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, on my way."

You can go out.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:13:34 You sit down.

03:13:34 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

03:13:36 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:13:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:13:37 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:13:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:13:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:13:45 You're already sitting.

03:13:50 The ship is already moving.

03:13:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:13:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:13:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:13:53 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

03:13:56 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:13:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:14:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:14:00 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:14:01 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:14:06 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

03:14:07 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:14:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:14:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:14:10 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:14:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

03:14:12 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:14:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:14:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:14:15 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:14:18 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Shooting Star. Welcome to Accord space."

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

03:18:13 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:18:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:18:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:18:29 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:18:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Shooting Star. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:18:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:18:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:18:50 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:19:35 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

03:19:39 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:19:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:19:41 You scramble to your feet.

03:19:41 You exit the capsule.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
The vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

03:19:41 You can't go that way.

03:19:42 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

03:19:42 You can go up.

03:19:43 Your ship 'Shooting Star' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:19:44 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:19:44 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:19:45 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:19:45 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

03:19:47 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:19:47 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:19:48 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:22:55 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:22:59 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:23:05 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:23:08 Lily Kaise opens a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

03:23:08 Lily Kaise puts a clear plastic food storage container in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:23:14 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:23:17 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:23:25 Lily Kaise asks, "What was Ather going about?"

03:24:42 You say, "Oh, he just wanted me to approve the QE message."

03:25:00 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

03:25:07 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't have general on."

03:25:35 Lily Kaise says, "Guess he was after me to do so when I was building and he came into the Invaders Spare Parts ship haha."

03:25:39 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:25:43 You laugh.

03:26:10 You say, "Think they're just trying to get as many different people to approve messages as possible."

03:26:54 Lily Kaise says, "Anyway our organization's channel isn't very secure but i'm sure you likey knew. Anytime there's a confidential exchange, just tell me face to face."

03:27:02 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:28:07 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise.

03:30:07 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:30:35 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a shark.

03:31:08 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:31:12 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:31:14 Lily says to you, "I love you."

03:31:33 You beam at Lily Kaise. "I love you too."

03:32:00 You say to Lily, "Up for a beacon drop or two?"

03:32:12 Lily Kaise says, "Sure."

03:32:38 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Whomever was interested in beacon drops earlier, are you still interested?"

03:33:21 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, who would be interested in beacon drops?"

03:33:30 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Perhaps after this nest."

03:33:42 [Tactical Communication] Joe Williams transmits, "Me."

03:34:03 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, how long on that nest?"

03:34:06 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If we are using an AEU ship or any other form of ship using energy weapons, I will engineer or gun as the case may be! However, feel free to prioritize others over me. I don't need the points."

03:34:11 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Just started."

03:34:25 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I could only engineer right now darn."

03:34:41 You nod to Lily Kaise. "It's fine."

03:34:42 Lily Kaise says, "I can gun but it will be pretty lousy but I would if it means Ather would go."

03:35:30 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but don't want us to go shorthanded."

03:35:40 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:36:07 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, let us know when you're done with that nest as I'd prefer not to go undercrewed."

03:36:35 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:38:19 You say, "If we have to go undercrewed, I'd be ok with it."

03:39:35 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo marches in from the south.

03:40:11 [Tactical Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Me and Jada would be in."

03:40:23 [Tactical Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Just hauling a roid then headed back."

03:40:33 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

03:40:40 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Hook that roid up. Hook it good."

03:41:25 Lily Kaise says, "No no at all so if we have two of these cadets who don't gun at all and i'm engineering, we'll be in a difficult situation."

03:42:27 You say, "I've been on beacons with both Joe, Josh and Caleb. They can all gun quite well."

03:42:44 You say, "I don't know about Jada though."

03:44:36 [Tactical Communication] Joe Williams transmits, "Do we have a meeting place or are you still looking for more people?"

03:45:00 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Meet at New Earth."

03:45:16 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:45:20 Lily Kaise joins your group.

03:45:30 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Hey, who does Lump the humanoid service robot belong to?"

03:45:32 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:45:35 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the south.

03:45:41 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:45:42 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:45:42 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise followed you.

03:45:44 You exit the ship.

03:45:44 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.
Lily Kaise followed you.

03:45:46 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

03:45:46 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
You can go out.
Lily Kaise followed you.

03:45:49 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles. "Not me."

03:45:59 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "In the New Earth lounge."

03:46:20 Lily Kaise orders a hot cup of espresso.

03:46:38 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Salvager1" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

03:46:49 Joe Williams just arrived.

03:46:53 Lily Kaise waves and smiles.

03:46:56 You hold Joe Williams's hand, taking him into your group.

03:46:59 Lily Kaise is already in your group.

03:47:03 You wave to Joe Williams.

03:47:19 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "How are you guys doing on that nest?"

03:47:19 Joe Williams exclaims, "Hello there!"

03:47:23 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 985" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

03:47:28 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Halfway I think."

03:47:31 I see no "secondary" here.

03:47:34 You open a leather briefcase.

03:47:35 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:47:37 You remove a secondary pilot command access unit from a leather briefcase.

03:47:41 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "We hit recess. The fun is really about to begin!"

03:47:50 You chuckle at a secondary pilot command access unit.

03:47:58 You chuckle at a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator.

03:48:00 Joe Williams says, "What's that."

03:48:04 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "We are good men and woman. Do not worry no bullies in the nest."

03:48:20 "What? This?" You pat a secondary pilot command access unit lightly.

03:48:23 Joe Williams nods.

03:48:37 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

03:48:42 You say, "It's a tool that adds some extra functions to a pilot in combat."

03:48:46 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Please use the tactical channel for important information only. Chatter is for the general channel."

03:49:01 Joe Williams says, "Ahh."

03:49:05 Joe Williams says, "How facinating."

03:49:14 You grin.

03:49:18 [General Communication] Juliette Wesmyer transmits, "No you are not good men and women."

03:49:18 You say, "It's very useful."

03:49:35 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Hush we survived mice."

03:49:35 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:49:40 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

03:49:53 [General Communication] Juliette Wesmyer transmits, "They should have eaten you."

03:50:05 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

03:50:15 [General Communication] Juliette Wesmyer transmits, "For an early lunch."

03:50:18 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 985" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

03:50:21 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Eat you first."

03:50:35 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

03:50:35 A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the steaming beverage.

03:50:51 [General Communication] Juliette Wesmyer transmits, "My charm means that people naturally want to protect me."

03:50:52 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Not A Target Drone!". The organization has earned 2,356,248.61 credits.

03:51:06 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "What charm. I only noticed the lack thereof?"

03:51:08 [General Communication] Juliette Wesmyer transmits, "I will never get eaten."

03:51:22 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "That's truly a sad day. When you realize you'll never get eaten."

03:51:35 A nearby pilot lectures at length about why having diplomatic relations with other alliances is stupid.

03:51:37 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport laughs.

03:51:43 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "It is evne sadder she gets denided the chance."

03:51:46 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

03:51:55 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Chevaliers can take care of that lack in your life."

03:53:44 Joe Williams puts a copy of "So You Want To Be A Combat Pilot" in a midnight blue silk backpack embroidered with gold willow leaves.

03:55:35 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:55:37 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 985" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

03:55:41 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

03:56:36 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

03:57:44 Joe Williams sits down on Baranth I'kabara's lap.

03:57:46 Joe Williams stands up from Baranth I'kabara's lap.

03:57:48 Joe Williams coughs.

03:57:55 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "How much longer on that nest?"

03:58:10 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Clsoe to finishing."

03:58:11 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings and chuckles.

03:58:13 Joe Williams exclaims, OOCly, "Say matching issue!"

03:58:20 You chuckle.

03:58:24 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "We got mice. Oh man!"

03:58:33 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 985" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

03:58:36 A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back out.

03:58:38 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "A pair of them. Blasted."

03:58:42 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You also have repairs to complete."

03:59:08 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Those interested in beacon drops, start making your way to New Earth please."

03:59:50 Lily Kaise says, "Wow her arm is pretty badly injured. I'm going to take her to the medical center."

03:59:55 Joe Williams asks, "Eh?"

04:00:04 Lily Kaise points at Baranth I'kabara.

04:00:12 Lily Kaise leaves your group.

04:00:13 [Tactical Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "On the way."

04:00:14 Lily Kaise holds Baranth I'kabara's hand, taking her into her group.

04:00:18 Lily Kaise pulls Baranth I'kabara to her feet.

04:00:18 Joe Williams says, "Oh, I hope that wasn't from me sitting on her...."

04:00:21 Lily Kaise's group glides out.

04:00:28 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Just a few rooms left. I think."

04:00:36 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

04:00:41 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

04:00:52 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "But hmm thinking can be dangerous so I will leave the thinking to someone else."

04:01:02 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Good idea."

04:01:36 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

04:01:46 Lily Kaise just arrived.

04:02:15 [General Communication] Juliette Wesmyer transmits, "Having some fun on the ground for once."

04:02:28 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

04:02:49 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "This is not the shopping network where people say they'r eproducts are good blah blah."

04:02:49 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Not A Target Drone!" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

04:02:49 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

04:02:50 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Joe Williams and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go out.

04:03:13 [General Communication] Juliette Wesmyer transmits, "Shut up!"

04:03:31 You peer out...

04:03:31 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
Caleb Davenport and Jada Nelson are standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

04:03:35 Caleb Davenport's group just arrived.

04:03:39 You take control of Caleb Davenport's group.

04:03:40 Caleb Davenport waves.

14:07:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:07:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:07:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi abe."

14:07:04 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

14:07:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:07:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:07:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:07:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

14:07:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:07:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:07:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:07:18 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:07:48 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "One more for beacons."

14:07:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:07:55 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:08:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

14:08:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:08:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:08:27 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

14:12:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:12:25 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

14:12:27 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

14:12:28 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

14:12:28 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

14:12:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:12:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:12:56 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:13:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:13:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:13:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:13:12 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:13:12 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:13:14 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

14:13:14 You can go out and enter into the ship.

14:13:14 You exit the ship.

14:13:21 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

14:13:21 You can go up.

14:13:23 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

14:13:23 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

14:13:24 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

14:13:24 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

14:13:28 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

14:13:30 You kiss Lily Kaise.

14:13:44 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

14:14:08 Among the AEU, you have a good amount of starship combat points, not very many aggregate points, not very many exploration points, not very many industry points, and relatively few ground combat points.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic lif

15:26:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I really would like to see AEU pilots exploring more, leading expeditions even with the loss of the arrow and magnetar."

15:26:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "There's a name I don't recognize on my communicator. Welcome."

15:26:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Welcome."

15:26:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Hello."

15:27:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You say you love to explore Shule. Let's organize something."

15:28:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Definitely. Unfortunately, I won't be able to do anything in terms of an expedition for at least a week or so. The first week of June, I will not be available much."

15:29:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Alright then, after that!"

15:32:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "However, in the mean time, things that need to be decibe decided include which ship will be used and the heading that will be taken."

15:33:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I was thinking more coreward."

15:33:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And which ship?"

15:34:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Still thinking on that, we have moderately limited options."

15:34:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Tactical platform is most likely the best choice."

15:34:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That's the best choice we have for a long exploration trip."

15:35:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Then it will have to work."

15:35:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And really, the only choice we have for a long exploration trip."

15:35:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Why should we explore?"

15:35:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah."

15:36:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The AEU has always been the alliance of exploration."

15:36:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We have just lost our way a bit as of late."

15:36:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Tradition is not a good reason."

15:36:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Even the arrow, the maximum charge on it is three days and only Ather has access to an arrow."

15:36:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Tradition is a foundation."

15:37:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Not the reason."

15:37:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Tradition is for people who have no creativity and no ability."

15:38:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "What do we get from exploring?"

15:38:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Shule I am going to take a nap. I would be happy to discuss this later."

15:38:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, rest well. Talk to you later."

15:39:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We learn about other cultures, see amazing nebulas and star formations, and grow in our understanding of the universe. What do you feel the AEU should pursue?"

15:40:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "What good are other cultures? Our culture is pretty great."

15:41:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I think we should get rich and make our culture the foremost culture. Others should visit us to learn how we do things."

15:42:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Not saying our cultures aren't great, but there is always the possibility of learning new things and gaining greater insite."

15:42:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

15:42:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Have you learned anything from other cultures?"

15:43:00 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.

15:44:16 I don't understand that.

15:45:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Absolutely. We've learned from the Jinu and from the ones who left behind the Glyphmaker's graves. And that's just a start."

15:46:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "The plant that was discovered at the aquarium has proven to be extremely useful."

15:46:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "A plant isn't a culture."

15:46:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Still took exploring to discover it."

15:46:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "The Gylphmaker's Graves are just ruins. That's not a culture either. It is a corpse."

15:47:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "The Jinu had technology, but the Outsiders had even better technology. And both the Jinu and the Outsiders came to us."

15:47:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Again, we don't know much about the former inhabitants, but we've learned much from what was left behind. That also took discovery and exploration to find."

15:48:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Looking for things to loot is okay. But the aliens that made that stuff learned how to make it originally."

15:48:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We should focus on that. Learning to make our own things."

15:50:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I think we should learn what we can, even if it means interacting with other cultures or exploring. New cultures was only one part of what I said. I also said that through exploration, we can learn more about our universe."

15:51:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We can learn about that with telescopes too. Let the astronomers do it."

15:51:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We should be bringing in money and resources to support our practical researchers."

15:51:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We are better tooled than they are since we are actually out here."

15:52:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And you think honestly that a telescope could have brought home a plant?"

15:52:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Or that it could have studied how to be able to detect rift storms?"

15:52:50 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Welcome, marion, sarah, tare, and aliyah."

15:52:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I think if we make sure there's plenty of resources, some scientist will come up with something just as good."

15:53:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "And if some other group goes and finds that stuff, we can always just buy it from the scavengers and rag pickers."

15:53:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And what is the point of having a starship, if you're just going to sit at home, staring through telescopes?"

15:53:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Leave exploration to the tramps. We should be making the AEU great."

15:54:49 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Nest?"

15:54:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Exploration is a way to make the AEU great. Why rely on others to make the discoveries when we are able to do so ourselves."

15:55:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We shouldn't be relying on scrounged materials we pick up from long lost aliens."

15:55:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "We should be making our own stuff."

15:56:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We didn't find the information to create rift storm detectors from a long lost alien race."

15:56:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Where did you find it then?"

15:57:00 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

15:57:17 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

15:57:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The information is contained in a blueprint from another race essentially."

15:57:25 You grin at Lily Kaise.

15:57:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "What race?"

15:57:30 I don't see "lily 'Thank you." here.

15:57:33 You kiss Lily Kaise.

15:57:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "That's not an answer."

15:57:37 You say to Lily Kaise, "Thank you."

15:57:48 Lily Kaise says, "Who the hell is this bitch."

15:58:03 You say, "Who knows, but I already dislike her."

15:58:55 Lily Kaise says, "I never can pronounce the bunarshe name correctly but that is where the blueprint came from."

15:59:01 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

15:59:03 You nod. "I know."

15:59:35 You say, "I was just trying to prove that we can learn from exploration."

15:59:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Sorry, if you said something I didn't hear it. I think I turned my comm's volume way down by mistake for a moment."

15:59:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I knocked my wrist on the counter."

15:59:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Let this guy do what he wants. He seems to just want to push buttons."

16:00:00 Lily Kaise says, "Good then keep itway way down and I hope your microphone breaks."

16:00:03 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:00:05 You laugh.

16:00:11 You say, "If not, I'll break it for you."

16:00:14 You chuckle.

16:00:26 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

16:00:38 Lily Kaise says, "I don't mind sharing information but I have little or no tolerance for demanding types."

16:00:47 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

16:00:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, so if you don't believe we should do any exploration, why did you join the pilot corps?"

16:01:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "What does making the AEU great mean to you?"

16:01:29 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

16:01:30 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

16:01:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Seriously there is other employment available for civilians."

16:01:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I want to get rich, fund researchers, and make money from the things they invent on my dime."

16:01:51 Lily Kaise says, "Oh my stars hold me back."

16:01:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And how do you plan on getting rich?"

16:02:12 You say to Lily, "No, you should hold me back."

16:02:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "That's why I became a pilot. Everyone knows you can get rich doing this."

16:02:44 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

16:02:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well I am likely the richest pilot in the universe and guess what much was gained through the awesome rewards of exploration."

16:02:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure, doing what exactly? Because just being a pilot doesn't make you rich. It means you do have to do something. What is that something you plan on doing?"

16:03:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Resource gathering. There's valuable stuff not that far away. Going out on road trips is stupid."

16:03:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, enjoy salvaging then."

16:03:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "No wonder President Garner wanted to fire all of you."

16:04:01 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

16:04:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup enjoy salvaging and all of that other mundane work and I sure won't listen to your whining and complaining about how broke you are."

16:04:08 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:04:10 You laugh.

16:05:11 You say to Lily, "Unfortunately, I need to go soon."

16:05:16 You say to Lily, "I love you."

16:05:22 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

16:05:36 Lily says to you, "I love you too. I look forward to when you're back at work Hun."

16:05:50 Lily Kaise says, "Or just here to be with."

16:05:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Kaise what do you do with all your credits, if you're the richest?"

16:06:33 You smile at Lily Kaise.

16:06:40 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

16:06:51 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

16:06:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have given a lot away. I donate to projects and I am available for anything else where I may lend a financial contribution."

16:07:03 You say to Lily, "I'll see you later."

16:07:12 Lily says to you, "Ok Love be safe!"

16:07:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Like expeditons and exploration."

16:07:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, as much as I'd love to stick around, I need to go. I'll be back later. Fly safe."

16:07:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Philantrophy is what people do when they have no vision."

16:08:02 You blink heavily and then doze off.

16:08:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "You should buy some factories and make stuff with your money."

16:08:44 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

16:08:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Not going beyond safe boundaries certainly cemonstrates absolutely no vision at all."

16:09:15 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

16:09:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Demonstrates that is anyway good luck with your career Cadet."

16:10:10 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."

16:10:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lily, I was discussing an expedition with Shule and would not mind running my thoughts by you as it hits planning."

16:10:21 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Hi Mel!"

16:10:32 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yo."

16:10:40 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey Melinda."

16:11:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Anyways, I wish you much luck cadet."

16:11:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Thanks."

16:11:18 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Hello melinda."

16:11:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Luck is nice. Hard work is what matters."

16:11:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Could you meet me near my office for the next term, Lily?"

16:12:25 Lily Kaise says, "Heh i've probably done more work here as a pilot than than this idiot will ever dream of doing."

16:12:51 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/General.

16:12:51 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

16:13:00 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:13:48 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay who said planets haven't exploded?"

16:13:58 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Some idiot."

16:15:01 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

16:15:07 [General Communication] "Well yes but who?" Melinda Michaels laughs.

16:15:33 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "You either want to shame them, or you think they're so stupid they will out themselves."

16:15:43 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Nice."

16:15:51 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Since you don't know me, I will ignore the shame mark."

16:16:01 Blueberry the old hefty violet feathered felo wanders in from the south.

16:16:05 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "That leaves you thinking they're stupid."

16:16:08 Lily Kaise strokes the soft feathers of Blueberry the old hefty violet feathered felo.

16:16:08 Blueberry the old hefty violet feathered felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

16:16:47 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You are the one who called them an idiot."

16:17:17 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "They are. But it takes someone really stupid to relive their worst moments over and over on request."

16:17:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Does it now?"

16:17:27 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Which is what you were asking for."

16:17:51 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Maybe it takes someone really stupid to start an argument with a pilot and judging them before you even know them."

16:17:56 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "You should be more considerate. You don't need to mock stupid people."

16:18:37 [General Communication] "What else should I do oh wise one?" Melinda Michaels laughs.

16:18:55 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Maybe you can teach me how to do all the things like how to use a battlesuit?"

16:19:35 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "There you go, being a bully."

16:19:41 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Me, a bully?"

16:19:46 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh my god."

16:19:48 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Cackles: you reall need to teach her that, yeah."

16:19:55 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Wait what?"

16:19:59 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Alko, am I a bully?"

16:20:01 Blueberry the old hefty violet feathered felo rubs up against a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, purring softly.

16:20:05 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Hell no."

16:20:07 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "You get called out on making fun of someone and you start throwing your weight around."

16:20:16 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "She is not."

16:20:19 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am not making fun. I just asked who said it."

16:20:23 Lily reaches down and hugs Blueberry.

16:20:29 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "It is a classic bully tactic to say "how about you show me how to do something I've had years of experience doing""

16:20:42 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "And how do you know I've had years of experience?"

16:20:52 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Even if you are making fun, you are making fun of someone who is misleading, so what."
[General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I've heard of you."

16:21:06 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh have you now?"

16:21:56 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Apparently you haven't heard much or you would know that I am far from a bully unless you totally piss me off. Which, you are the first cadet who has done it. Nice going there wise one."

16:21:58 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I've spent two years studying to be a pilot. You hear stuff, even about pilots in other alliances, if you're paying attention."

16:22:35 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "You're a bully. You just are good at getting people to kiss your butt."

16:22:50 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "The first people who doesn't and you threaten them on the general channel. That's a great example to set for your people."

16:23:02 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Now if you will excuse me, I have more important things to do than engage in this silly arguing with a wet behind the ears pilot."

16:23:12 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "There you go, put downs."

16:23:25 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Oooooh. What did I wake up to?"

16:23:35 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs. "I don't like ass kissers thank you very much."

16:23:41 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "This is sounding exciting."

16:23:42 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The AEU gained an idiot."

16:23:47 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "A mouthy rood little Cadet."

16:23:48 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Your words say one thing. Your actions say something else."

16:23:51 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am being bullied by a cadet."

16:24:02 Blueberry the old hefty violet feathered felo wanders south.

16:24:10 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Somebody help me, oh my god, what ever do I do?"

16:24:42 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Sounding about right for AEU, to be fair."

16:24:47 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport laughs.

16:24:49 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Indeed."

16:25:06 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "No offense, Verny."

16:25:09 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Yeah Not many smart ones there."

16:25:17 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Except yes, I meant to offend."

16:25:26 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "No argument from me. Most of the AEU pilots should have been fired."

16:25:41 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "What now."

16:26:07 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Good morning, and what did I step into?"

16:26:10 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You do realise if the AEU pilots had been fired, you would not have a job currently yourself."

16:26:15 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "A fresh start with people who believe in something would have been much better."

16:26:21 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I'd have gone navy if that happened."

16:26:39 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yo there other cadet. I hope you aren't going to call me names too?"

16:26:51 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "So you talking about old people in AEU now?"

16:26:53 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Why would I?"

16:27:01 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

16:27:02 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I dunno, it seems to be the trend."

16:27:17 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I will call you names, Melinda, if you ask nicely."

16:27:22 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels whistles.

16:27:24 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega chortles.

16:27:27 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Yeah, I'm talking about all the Garner-era pilots. Most of them deserved to be fired."

16:27:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Jason might get mad."

16:27:33 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox giggles.

16:27:43 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Jason might want a holovid."

16:27:53 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Woo."

16:28:11 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "No melinda I will not. I don't know why this trend started but it won't continue with me."

16:28:16 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Maybe they can do something useful, but what I heard from them makes me think they just want to goof off like they did when Garner was running the show."

16:28:40 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Best is the president we needed. He'll get results, even from them."

16:28:57 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "That's good to know."

16:29:01 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

16:32:57 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hey Morris, am I a bully?"

16:33:01 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

16:33:05 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "This is Morris."

16:33:07 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Yes."

16:33:33 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Thank you for confirmation."

16:33:37 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "La la la la, I am Morris. Melinda is bully."

16:33:39 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Not to my knowing."

16:36:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sorry Mel, couldn't reach my comm for a sec."

16:37:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And Mel, you are the worst kinda bully."

16:37:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The absolute worst."

16:37:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Whoever's callin Mel a bully, you got issues. Not that Mel couldn't defend herself, but she couldn't 'bully' herself outta a wet paper bag."

16:38:17 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh I can if this silly pilot wants me to."

16:38:26 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "An AEu bashing stick. Now this will be nice to see used."

16:38:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Defendin yourself's different from bullyin."

16:43:01 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

16:47:01 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

16:53:01 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

16:56:15 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "What is with all these robots sitting around?"

16:56:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Like sanitation drones?"

16:56:42 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Service robots."

16:56:44 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "That's not nice to talk about Ather like that. He does sit around a lot, but at least Aisling gets him to do things once in a while."

16:56:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

16:57:01 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

16:57:11 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "There was one in the mail room in New Pheonix, and there's one right here on the pad on Tandem station."

16:57:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Where you seein a bunch of 'em Marion? I think I said that right?"

16:57:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...I don't know nothin about one at Tandem, just New Earth and Chet's pile of parkin tickets."

16:57:56 [General Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "Is this normal?"

16:58:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not really. But it happens."

17:00:34 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Not A Target Drone!". The organization has earned 242,193.21 credits.

17:03:01 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

17:03:20 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Beacons?"

17:04:36 [Tactical Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Sure."

17:05:08 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I need two more."

17:05:14 [Tactical Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "I'll try it."

17:05:39 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "C'mon, one more."

17:06:20 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Come on, just one more pilot for beacons."

17:06:34 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Cadet, come to old earth."

17:07:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

17:07:43 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

17:07:47 Lily Kaise picks up a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

17:07:50 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

17:08:40 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

17:08:42 Lily Kaise glides out.

17:08:43 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

17:09:18 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Last call for beacons."

17:11:03 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/SC.

17:11:04 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

17:17:01 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

17:17:51 [Tactical Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "I missed it did someone say beacons?"

17:18:03 [Tactical Communication] Marion Fabre transmits, "You snooze, you lose."

17:18:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh no."

17:18:18 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Give us a few to do this one and we'll get a bigger ship."

17:18:18 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What Erik?"

17:18:21 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "My industry has almost passed my combat score."

17:18:22 [Tactical Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "We can do one once we finish this one Josh."

17:18:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

17:18:33 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "This cannot be allowed to happen."

17:18:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You will live."

17:18:46 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "#ou're not Cesar Ysidro, Erik."

17:19:02 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

17:19:04 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Very bracing."

23:51:19 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior pulsates gently.

23:53:35 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Debris Monster". The organization has earned 146,568.44 credits.

23:54:18 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:54:20 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

23:54:23 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

23:54:23 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:54:26 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:54:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

23:54:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:54:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:54:43 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

23:54:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Ardsley Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:54:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Campeche."

23:54:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:54:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:54:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:54:50 The ship has arrived in the Campeche cluster, a solar system filled with a wealth of colonizable planets.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:54:51 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Ardsley Orbit."

23:54:52 Lily Kaise puts a compact white refrigerator in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

23:54:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:54:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:54:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:54:56 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Ardsley in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:54:58 Via general sector communication, Ardsley transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to Ardsley Orbit!"

23:54:58 Lily Kaise picks up an insulated purple cooler.

23:55:03 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

23:55:04 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Ardsley.

23:55:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:55:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:55:21 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:55:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The Fringe welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:55:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:55:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:55:38 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

23:55:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:55:39 Lily Kaise glides out.

23:55:41 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:58:30 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:58:32 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

23:58:36 Lily Kaise puts an insulated purple cooler in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

23:58:39 You smile at Lily Kaise.

23:58:41 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

23:58:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:58:47 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:58:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

23:58:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:59:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:59:08 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

23:59:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:59:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:59:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:59:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:59:15 Lily Kaise removes a compact red refrigerator from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

23:59:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:59:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:59:20 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:59:23 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

23:59:31 Lily Kaise opens a compact red refrigerator and the light inside clicks on.

23:59:32 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

23:59:33 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

23:59:36 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 279" has jumped into the sector.

23:59:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.
