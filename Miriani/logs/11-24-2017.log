The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent st

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at "Mischief" Docking Bay.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too
