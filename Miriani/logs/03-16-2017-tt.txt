[MTTS] alexv has joined the channel.
[MTTS] alexv: Hello everyone, is this an appropriate place to ask about
connection issues?
[MTTS] usfolks: Basically what I know is that the domain is down and you have to
use the IP address to connect.
[MTTS] atherj: Newbie probably works better for this kind of thing, but
apparently, the main domain is down.
[MTTS] alexv: Ah, ok I was curious because had a few friends trying to connect
but they were saying it's showing they're locked out because of multiple wrong
password attempts but the link they got given to reset password isn't
functioning. So I'm guessing they just have to wait till the sight is back?
[MTTS] atherj: Or use the IP address to connect.
[MTTS] alexv: They are.
[MTTS] atherj: 104.181.170.164.
[MTTS] atherj: Oh.
[MTTS] usfolks: Should just be able to use 104.181.170.164.
[MTTS] alexv: Again, they are being blocked through the ip for multiple wrong pw
attempts but can't reset so I was curious if there's anything they can do or
should they just wait until sight is back.
[MTTS] usfolks: That being said, I have not been logged out since well before it
happened. I know several people who have connected through the IP with no
problem, but really can't tell you why your friends wouldn't be able to connect
and would get that particular error. Might have them try contacting hosts
through their the Official Roleplaying Eradication Website accounts. That's all
I can think of.
[MTTS] usfolks: Uh...tweet to them.
[MTTS] usfolks: Forgot about that filter...ahem.
[MTTS] atherj: Love that filter.
[MTTS] usfolks: Anyway, @squidsoft and @StarConquest.
[MTTS] alexv: Yeah I can connect fine through the IP, they just can't because
they couldn't remember their password and so got locked out but no way to reset
with the sight down. I appologize a better question would've been if there is
anything they can do to reset the password since the sight is down. I'll suggest
that to them, thank you.
[MTTS] atherj: If they got locked out of their account because they don't
remember their password, I think it's a timed lockout.
[MTTS] usfolks: If they just use their same connection in their client and only
change the domain to the IP, they'll be fine once the timeout resolves.
[MTTS] atherj: I always thought it was like, five minutes or something.
[MTTS] alexv: Aha, that's good to know then too, I thought it was too but it's
been a long while since I got locked out.
[MTTS] usfolks: No, it's longer than that. At least half an hour I think.
[MTTS] atherj: Oh, well, it could be, it could be. I never really had that
issue.
[MTTS] B.A.: You can send them to http://104.181.170.164:3333?
[MTTS] usfolks: That should work. I wasn't sure what the full address was for
that.
[MTTS] alexv: You, are a wonderful person.
[MTTS] alexv: Thank you. That does work.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[MTTS] alexv: Oh sad, the initial part does work looks like the password
forgotten link does not though. So they may just have to wait.
[MTTS] usfolks: If they just use the settings they currently have saved in their
client and only change the server from the domain to the IP, they will have
their correct password.
[MTTS] usfolks: Then it's only an issue of waiting out the timer.
