00:26:17 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

00:26:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

00:40:05 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Rocka Rolla". The organization has earned 296,551.68 credits and 1 megacredit.

00:41:03 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "All the asteroids."

00:41:06 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "...to mine."

00:41:10 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Ha, ha."

00:41:23 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Exactly."

00:41:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I tried a site yesterday, I think I made nine million."

00:42:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "What was your conversion rate?"

00:42:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "90."

00:42:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, that's beautiful."

00:42:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "For a cadet."

00:43:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "As you buy more upgrades, and especially as you buy the mining licenses, it starts to become much, much more worthwhile. I wasn't kidding when I said down the line, you could make that 500 million you made in a week or so, in only two mining sites."

00:44:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Looking forward to it."

00:44:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "A 90% conversion rate is really good for you though. It implies you know what you're doing."

00:45:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Obviously, you'll have to adjust your tactics as you start to unlock larger asteroids with the max metals upgrade purchases and the like, but you're definitely on the right track."

00:45:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I was just guessing."

00:45:42 [Starship "Vengeance"; Engineering Room]

00:45:42 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a large leather chair and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and down.

00:45:44 [Starship "Vengeance"; Control Room]

00:45:44 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:45:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "So lucky gueses?"

00:45:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If it's greater than 90%, all the better. If it's less...well, depends on how much less."

00:45:48 Not much to see out there.

00:46:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There's no guessing involved. Only sound logic!"

00:46:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well that was only my third site."

00:47:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't forget to check from time to time which UPGRADES you might qualify for at any mining station."

00:47:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can probably already buy a few here and there."

00:47:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I think I have the ones I could get at my level."

00:47:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Grand, grand."

00:48:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I thought about heading over to froniter since I helped clear it."

00:48:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm hanging out here too. I set up my mining site, now I'm just casually letting it run and talking to whoever."

00:50:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Wonder how long it would take to completely clear that place of bari."

00:51:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Who can know. Mr. Laurence gave no timeframe."

00:51:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Just keep getting rid of them until they are gone."

00:51:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "In escence."

00:52:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Not much else I figure, that can be done."

00:53:04 There appear to be 18 pilots recently active.

01:02:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They do. So I try to spend an hour reflecting on them, and working on my techniques."

01:02:35 Guindalen Jones says, "That is a while. You must enjoy it."

01:05:36 You say, "I do."

01:05:37 You grin.

01:06:01 You say, "It's a career with a lot of variety and very lucrative."

01:06:05 You smile.

01:06:31 Guindalen Jones says, "Ive only been ut her for a few days. Geting used to the wide breath of opertunity."

01:06:38 You nod to Guindalen Jones.

01:06:49 You say, "Well, if you have any question, don't hesitate to ask."

01:06:54 You say, "Questions."

01:07:01 Guindalen Jones says, "Why thank you."

01:07:48 Guindalen Jones says, "At the momet I cant think of anything but I have not even reached cruseing altatude. Smirk."

01:07:56 You grin.

01:08:07 You ask, "So,  what made you want to become a pilot?"

01:08:19 Guindalen Jones gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:09:22 Guindalen Jones says, "Partly an excape but most of all making a decision for myself. Wanting more."

01:09:34 You smile. "Awesome."

01:10:05 You say, "If you want to make lots of credits, come on beacon drops when people call for them."

01:10:32 You ask, "Do you know how to gun yet?"

01:10:37 Guindalen Jones says, "I will after I get more comfeterable dealing with rats."

01:11:07 You smile. "Actually, fighting outsiders is different and in many ways easier than fighting rats."

01:11:31 Guindalen Jones says, "My first was great no problem. The second not so much. Third was better. I don't recal if I have had a 4th."

01:11:51 You nod.

01:12:42 You say, "The nice thing about beacons is that you can just concentrate on gunning. Not moving or repairing, just gunning."

01:13:11 Guindalen Jones says, "Its just geting used to not being in the simulaters that's all. That would be easear."

01:13:21 You nod.

01:13:23 You say, "True."

01:13:49 You say, "Well, we have simulators here you can practice on too. They're over at Accord."

01:14:35 Guindalen Jones nods.

01:14:40 Guindalen Jones says, "I think I saw them. I went all over accord."

01:14:47 You say, "Oh good."

01:14:55 You say, "That's a confusing place for many."

01:15:02 You say, "But a good place to know."

01:15:10 Guindalen Jones says, "I still have lots to explore."

01:15:20 You ask, "Have you been to Space Vermon Patrol?"

01:15:25 I don't understand that.

01:15:28 You ask, "Or SVP?"

01:15:41 Guindalen Jones says, "Yes I have been to nermon."

01:15:46 Guindalen Jones says, "Vermon."

01:15:48 You cheer for Guindalen Jones!

01:15:51 You exclaim, "Awesome!"

01:15:59 You say, "They're missions are great."

01:17:10 Guindalen Jones says, "But that all and new earth and the other two stations with new earth is all I have seen as of yet. Mind you a few sectors with only debre in it but same point."

01:17:17 You nod.

01:17:33 You say, "There's certainly a lot to explore."

01:18:04 Guindalen Jones says, "And paying close attention so to not miss a thing. Some shops like to hide."

01:18:12 You exclaim, "Yes, very true!"

01:18:26 Guindalen Jones chuckles.

01:18:34 You say to Guindalen, "Are you liking pilot life thus far?"

01:18:48 Guindalen Jones says, "Something tells me you have overlooked a thing or two in your time."

01:18:55 Guindalen Jones says, "Yes I have."

01:19:01 You exclaim, "Huh, overlooked many things!"

01:19:10 You smile at Guindalen Jones.

01:20:41 You ask, "What's your favorite part of pilot life so far?"

01:20:55 Guindalen Jones gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:21:26 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Rocka Rolla". The organization has earned 281,510.81 credits.

01:22:24 Guindalen Jones says, "Most of what I have done is salvage. I have delt with a few rats like I have said. I have also done a rat probe mission. Ponder I like the freadom most of all."

01:22:47 You grin.

01:22:53 You say, "That's good."

01:23:07 You say, "Salvaging is great for points."

01:23:13 You say, "Industrial points."

01:23:19 Guindalen Jones says, "Exactly."

01:23:28 Guindalen Jones says, "Some points and some cash."

01:23:35 You exclaim, "Definitely!"

01:24:13 Guindalen Jones says, "Ive expearanced exchanging for foren curence already too *grumble* no thanks to the rats."

01:24:37 You nod. "It happens."

01:24:53 You say, "I have credits in all of the alliances' different currencies."

Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

01:25:23 Guindalen Jones says, "I plan to do that but not there yet."

01:25:49 You nod and smile.

01:26:01 You say, "It'll happen."

01:26:03 You say, "Over time."

01:26:14 Guindalen Jones says, "Just a couple mill in each sounds good."

01:26:18 You smile.

01:26:51 Guindalen Jones asks, "What is your favorite ship to use?"

01:26:56 You say, "If you work hard as a pilot, the day will come when you'll have a few billion in each currency."

01:27:12 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder. "That's a good question."

01:27:22 You say, "IT depends on what I'm doing."

01:27:40 Guindalen Jones says, "Ok lets start with what do you like to do then."

01:27:41 You glance around at your surroundings. "This ship, the one we're in is my favorite combat ship."

01:27:52 Guindalen Jones nods.

01:28:03 Guindalen Jones says, "I presume good for cash and points."

01:28:34 Guindalen Jones strokes a fuzzy stuffed bear lovingly.

01:28:41 You say, "I enjoy everything. Salvaging is one of the least favorite activities of mine, but I love combat, ground combat and exploration."

01:28:55 Guindalen Jones says, "I bet he is good for attacks *snicker*."

01:29:06 You chuckle.

01:29:21 "Someone put that in here." You gesture vaguely at a fuzzy stuffed bear. "I don't even know who."

01:29:26 You laugh.

01:29:27 Guindalen Jones says, "I know I will need to work on ground combat at some point."

01:30:07 You say, "But cruisers are tough to earn."

01:30:09 Guindalen Jones says, "Maybe they thought he would scare some enamies off."

01:30:13 You laugh.

01:30:27 You say, "I doubt it. I think they just put it in here as a mascott or something."

01:30:50 Guindalen Jones says, "Ah an insperational force. Snicker."

01:30:54 You laugh.

01:30:55 You say, "Yeah."

01:30:57 You say, "Exactly."

01:31:00 Guindalen Jones chuckles.

01:31:09 You ask, "Maybe as a good luck bearr?"

01:31:12 You say, "Bear."

01:31:17 Guindalen Jones says, "Could be."

01:31:57 You say, "But keep in mind, I have something like 28 ships."

01:32:18 Guindalen Jones nods.

01:32:37 Guindalen Jones says, "That is good to know."

01:32:39 You say, "All serv different purposes."

01:32:42 You smile.

01:32:52 Guindalen Jones asks, "Do you know how many most pilots have?"

01:33:03 You say, "Probably about that if not some even more."

01:33:09 Guindalen Jones nods.

01:33:21 You say, "I've heard as many as 47."

01:33:27 Guindalen Jones blinks.

01:33:30 You nod.

01:33:38 Guindalen Jones says, "Im just thinking of my one."

01:33:44 You grin.

01:33:48 You say, "Give it time."

01:33:55 Guindalen Jones says, "I will."

01:33:58 You say, "You'll start to collect them over time."

01:34:27 Guindalen Jones says, "Im hopeing to get another soon but I have work to get there."

01:34:39 You grin at Guindalen Jones.

01:34:46 You ask, "Which ship?"

01:35:22 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:35:27 Guindalen Jones says, "At this point a larger cargo ship larger hauls more income then on to biger things."

01:35:33 You nod and smile.

01:37:47 You say, "Well, it's definitely nice to see some new faces in the AEU pilot corps."

01:37:57 Guindalen Jones says, "Right now im working with the technolagy scientist; I think he was, geting some more nickle."

01:38:09 You say, "Ah, ok. Cool."

01:38:13 You say, "Very cool."

01:38:38 Guindalen Jones says, "I probably will go back to vermon and do another rat run soon."

01:38:47 You exclaim, "Awesome!"

01:39:06 Guindalen Jones says, "The only way to get over hesatation is to get in there."

01:39:09 You say, "Well, you're always welcome on beacons if I call for them."

01:39:18 You nod to Guindalen Jones.

01:39:21 You say, "For sure."

01:39:29 Guindalen Jones says, "Thank you Shule."

01:39:57 You smile. "You bet."

01:40:25 Guindalen Jones asks, "I might take you up on it it will be good to see and get a feel. Still track lock and shoot?"

01:40:36 You say, "And if you ever need help, don't hesitate to give a shout out over the alliance channel or General channel. We'll be happy to help."

01:41:02 Guindalen Jones says, "Right now just working on making friends and it seems to be working."

01:41:04 You say, "Yes, minus the track part. The pilot of the ship tracks. You just lock and shoot."

01:41:05 Guindalen Jones smiles.

01:41:20 Guindalen Jones says, "Ah."

01:41:25 Guindalen Jones says, "Even easear."

01:41:29 You say, "Exactly."

01:41:36 Guindalen Jones nods.

01:41:39 You say, "Don't worry about repairs or anything. Just aim and shoot."

01:41:46 You ask, "You can manage that, right?"

01:41:56 Guindalen Jones says, "I should be able to yes."

01:42:00 You grin.

01:42:07 You say, "I'm sure you'll do just fine."

01:42:19 Guindalen Jones says, "Thanks for the reasurance."

01:42:21 You say, "Hell, you'll probably do better than I did when I first started out."

01:42:45 Guindalen Jones says, "As long as I do better than my second rat run I will be happy."

01:42:50 You smile.

01:43:06 You say, "I find it's much easier when you just have one thing to concentrate on."

01:43:16 Guindalen Jones nods.

01:43:41 Guindalen Jones says, "Yah one thing. That second rat run ended up being 3 rats at once."

01:43:43 You say, "Combat in a fighter is challenging because you have to think about moving, evading, repair, and shooting."

01:43:44 Guindalen Jones sighs.

01:43:58 You say, "Awww."

01:44:05 You say, "I know the feeling."

01:44:15 You say, "I almost lost my fighter fighting rats once."

01:44:25 You say, "So don't be too hard on yourself."

01:46:09 Guindalen Jones says, "The only reason im heard at all is because I had no problem with at rat when the orientation officer sent me out near one. Its just that I totaloy blanked on what to to on that second one. Most likely being stuned by the 3 of them."

01:46:26 Shule nods understandingly.

01:48:07 Guindalen Jones says, "Well practice more and get better is all we can do. And hopfuly not get out butts handed to us in the process."

01:48:11 Guindalen Jones chuckles.

02:29:17 You nod.

02:29:19 You say, "Yeah."

02:29:39 A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back out.

02:30:22 Lily says to you, "By the way Love, whe you do ground combat, you probably would want to turn off points contributions since we have more ground than we'll ever need."

02:30:30 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:30:35 You say, "Oh, heh. I forgot about that. Ok."

02:30:38 You grin.

02:30:45 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah and I know you can use the points."

02:30:50 You smile.

02:31:14 Lily Kaise says, "Unfortunately, when we go to GMG, it's unavoidable as we do need the exploration and combat."

02:31:20 You nod.

02:31:25 You say, "Very true."

02:31:32 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:31:36 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:31:59 Lily Kaise says, "Ow I hope that wasn't on someone's foot or toes out there."

02:32:06 You chuckle. "Me too."

02:33:18 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:34:39 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

02:34:41 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 291,068.80 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.

02:35:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

02:36:39 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

02:37:39 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

02:39:40 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:46:39 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:46:56 Lily Kaise says, "Our scoop will go offline in a couple of days. I have already loaded the modules."

02:47:12 You say, "Yeah, I saw the modules in Herding Cats when I was in there."

02:47:17 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Great!"

02:47:39 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

02:47:39 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

02:48:10 Lily Kaise says, "I sure wish others wouldn't be so careless with their glassware in here."

02:48:17 You say, "No kidding."

02:48:24 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

02:48:24 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out.

02:48:34 You say, "There is a trashcan in here."

02:48:39 You hear someone happily recount a recent asteroid mining victory.

02:48:47 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I was always taught to put the disposables in a recycle bin or such at least!"

02:48:53 You nod. "Me too."

02:50:59 You ask, "Well, want to head back to Dove?"

02:51:03 Lily Kaise nods.

02:51:09 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

02:51:15 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

02:51:15 You can go up.
Lily Kaise followed you.

02:51:17 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:51:17 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:51:18 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:51:18 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.
Lily Kaise followed you.

02:51:21 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:51:30 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:51:31 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:51:35 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:51:37 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:51:40 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:51:58 Lily Kaise says, "I always feel as though I'm in a fishbowl in the lounge there hehe."

02:52:03 You laugh.

02:52:09 You say, "Yeah, exactly."

02:53:10 Lily Kaise says, "After I learned what our instructors did when they would come to the lounge to eavesdrop on things. Still, they did collect a lot of useful knowledge which was in those notebooks they allowed me to peruse."

02:53:11 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:53:18 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:53:28 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:53:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

02:53:33 You stroke a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

02:53:37 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

02:53:44 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Hey little lizie."

02:54:04 Lily Kaise says, "I'll be back, she could use some food."

02:54:06 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:54:07 You say, "Ok."

02:54:08 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:54:08 You grin.

02:54:09 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:54:10 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:54:23 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:54:25 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:54:29 Lily Kaise dangles a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

02:54:36 Lily Kaise grins.

02:54:39 You grin.

02:54:40 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:54:45 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:54:58 You say to Lily, "My wonderful, sexy love."

02:54:59 Lily Kaise says, "Oh wow silly thing is still hungry."

02:55:03 You laugh.

02:55:10 a Tardick lizard named Asteria

02:55:10 This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

02:55:16 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:55:19 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:55:23 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:55:33 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

02:55:36 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

02:55:40 Lily Kaise dangles an orange scone in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

02:55:54 a Tardick lizard named Asteria

02:55:54 This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. Its stomach is bulging, but it seems content to slowly digest its large meal.

02:56:06 Lily Kaise says, "There I think she's satisfied now."

02:56:09 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:56:12 You say, "There we go. She doesn't look hungry anymore."

02:56:16 You laugh.

02:57:34 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

02:57:41 You say to Lily, "So happy to see you."

02:58:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:00:33 I don't understand that.

03:00:40 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:05:59 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:06:15 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:06:24 You say to Lily, "So happy to see you!"

03:06:43 Lily Kaise says, "Heh I should set up a mining site but I'm not particularly motivated to do so this morning."

03:06:48 You nod.

03:07:05 Lily Kaise says, "But if yo u were, I'd at least go over there and keep you company."

03:07:09 You ask, "Yeah, and you'll only be around for another couple hours, right?"

03:07:16 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

03:07:33 You say, "I'll probably start one later today."

03:07:40 Lily Kaise nods.

03:07:40 You say, "When I wake up."

03:07:47 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:08:55 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

03:08:57 Lily Kaise says, "I sure am glad to see new pilots but for one's like Vernos, his remaining as a Cadet for so long is troublesome."

03:09:14 You say, "Yeah, Constantine already is no longer a cadet."

03:09:17 Lily Kaise says, "I hope he is working on his paperwork."

03:09:22 You say, "He is."

03:09:31 Lily Kaise says, "Awesome."

03:09:48 You say, "Constantine must have had his paperwork approved just today."

03:10:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

03:10:39 Lily Kaise says, "Wow he must be a top notch candidate then and that is great."

03:10:52 You say, "Vernos told Kim to put in a good word to the AEU government on his behalf."

03:10:59 You chuckle.

03:11:08 Lily Kaise says, "Well unfortunately, we have no influence."

03:11:11 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:11:19 You say, "Yeah, that's exaclty what she told him."

03:11:22 You laugh.

03:11:35 Lily Kaise says, "It's the pilot who has to prove his or her aptitude and otherwise."

03:11:44 You say, "Precisely."

03:11:52 Lily Kaise says, "I'm glad she did."

03:11:58 You nod.

03:12:18 You say, "And VErnos is trying to get copies of the League and Fringe upgrade books."

03:12:45 You chuckle. "He's had no success at that though."

03:13:03 Lily Kaise says, "Also he's obviously been influenced by others outside of our Alliance. As I said the other day, Yes the AEU has it's scars but other alliances have very similar issues. Heh Dennis Feldman is still at large and there's never any mention of that."

03:13:12 You nod.

03:13:15 You say, "Exactly."

03:13:25 Lily Kaise says, "He was the main perpetrator of the slavor incident."

03:13:31 You nod.

03:13:58 Lily Kaise says, "Ugh."

03:14:05 Lily Kaise asks, "Why would he want those?"

03:14:25 You say, "Apparently because he wants a copy of every book ever written by alliance pilots."

03:14:31 Lily Kaise says, "Those are supposed to be confidential amongst alliances."

03:14:36 You say, "I know."

03:14:58 Lily Kaise says, "I hope someone informed him of such."

03:15:12 You say, "Kim basically told him that."

03:15:18 Lily Kaise says, "Good."

03:15:44 Lily Kaise says, "I'd like to keep an eye on this constantine to see what his motivations are."

03:15:50 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:15:51 You say, "I just hope he doesn't go around sharing the AEU upgrade book with all of the alliances."

03:15:58 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah seriously."

03:16:07 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:16:18 You say, "Yeah, I'll keep an eye on Constantine too."

03:16:22 Lily Kaise says, "If he does, then we have some serious issues with him and I know Ather will really not be satisfied."

03:16:28 You say, "Oh I know."

03:16:56 Lily Kaise says, "I wouldn't be opposed to inviting a productive pilot into sEAS."

03:17:03 You grin. "Neither would I."

03:17:07 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:17:10 Lily Kaise says, "Or pilots."

03:17:13 You grin.

03:17:29 You say, "As of right now though, I'm not eager to invite Vernos."

03:17:43 Lily Kaise says, "Although socializing is fun, I'm not into Starseekers soaial club."

03:17:48 Lily Kaise says, "Social."

03:17:49 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:17:49 You chuckle.

03:17:58 You say, "Neither am I."

03:18:12 Lily Kaise says, "Oh no, I'm not impressed with Vernos at all."

03:18:42 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:18:46 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:20:25 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:23:35 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

03:23:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Perhaps we can conduct an AEU only expedition sometime."

03:23:55 You say to Lily, "You wouldn't have time for a beacon or two?"

03:24:04 a gold wrist-mounted chronometer

03:24:04 It covers nothing.
You glance down at your watch, noting the time:

03:24:10 You say, "Oh, getting a bit late."

03:24:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be awesome."

03:24:26 Lily Kaise says, "But if you got enough interest, I'd go along."

03:27:58 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:28:06 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out.

03:28:22 You say to Lily Kaise, "Hi, long time no see."

03:28:23 Lily Kaise says to you, "You have a key to Flying Cat right?"

03:28:52 Lily Kaise says, "It's currently full of soldiers."

03:28:54 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:28:54 You say, "Oh."

03:28:56 You laugh.

03:28:57 You grin.

03:29:06 Lily Kaise says, "I need to move them at some point."

03:29:16 You say, "Felo are a bit distracting while trying to gun."

03:29:18 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't htink you had a Tier 1 gunship."

03:29:43 You say, "I'll get you one."

03:29:47 Lily Kaise says, "Er I didn't htink I did."

03:29:47 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:29:52 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

03:29:57 You ask, "You don't have a key to Praying Mantis?"

03:30:00 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

03:30:04 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm let's see."

03:30:12 Lily Kaise says, "Nope."

03:30:12 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Pretzel Paluza" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

03:30:17 You say, "Ok, I'll get you one."

03:30:18 Tamra Swenson just arrived.

03:30:19 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Stubborn Mule" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

03:30:20 Tamra Swenson smiles and nods.

03:30:21 Lily Kaise waves.

03:30:23 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Hi there!"

03:30:23 You wave.

03:30:25 Lily Kaise says, "Hi."

03:30:25 Tamra Swenson says, "I'm tamra."

03:30:26 You hold Tamra Swenson's hand, taking her into your group.

03:30:28 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

03:30:44 Tamra Swenson grins.

03:30:45 You say, "Fantabulously."

03:30:47 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

03:30:47 A seagull flaps by the window.

03:30:49 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Great for a Tuesday morning!"

03:30:50 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Yayayayayyayayay!"

03:30:54 You laugh.

03:31:48 You hold Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

03:31:50 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Hi to you!"

03:31:52 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

03:31:52 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Tamra Swenson, and Constantine Stone are standing here.
You can go out.

03:32:01 Lily says to Constantine, "Hey oh you're from a wonderful place."

03:32:16 Tamra Swenson says, "Well i'm from a planet with very few resources."

03:32:19 Tamra Swenson says, "It works."

03:32:21 Tamra Swenson shrugs.

03:32:22 Lily Kaise nods.

03:32:23 You say to Tamra, "Which one?"

03:32:33 Constantine says to Lily, "Yeah, it pretty nice."

03:32:44 Tamra Swenson says, "Cardinez."

03:32:47 A pair of pilots stride in haughtily, glimmering with gold and diamonds.

03:32:48 You say, "Ah, ok."

03:32:51 Tamra Swenson says, "Or something pronoucned something like that."

03:32:53 Tamra Swenson laughs.

03:32:56 You laugh.

03:32:57 Lily Kaise grins.

03:32:58 Constantine Stone smiles.

03:33:00 Tamra Swenson says, "It's a long dayh."

03:33:02 Tamra Swenson shrugs.

03:33:05 You say, "Oh dear."

03:33:07 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

03:33:13 You say to Lily, "Do you have beacons?"

03:33:18 Lily Kaise gives Constantine Stone some credits.

03:33:19 Tamra Swenson says, "I don't."

03:33:21 Tamra Swenson smiles.

03:33:26 Tamra Swenson asks, "Hi there who are you all?"

03:33:29 You say, "We can stop by Accord if need be."

03:33:29 Tamra Swenson blushes.

03:33:32 Lily Kaise nods.

03:33:44 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

03:33:44 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Tamra Swenson, and Constantine Stone are standing here.
You can go out.

03:33:49 You peer out...

03:33:50 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The one-person cargo hauler "Fire Comet" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
Tamra Swenson exclaims, "It is an honor to hang with you all!"

03:33:50 Lily Kaise asks, "Hmm where's our other pilot?"

03:33:55 Tamra Swenson says, "I don't know."

03:33:56 Tamra Swenson shrugs.

03:33:58 Constantine says to Lily, "Thanks, Lily."

03:34:07 Constantine says to Lily, "But what's this for?"

03:34:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Guindalen, are you on your way?"

03:34:12 Lily says to Constantine, "Sure just a little to help you along there."

03:34:17 Constantine Stone smiles.

03:34:24 Constantine says to Lily, "I appreciate it."

03:34:28 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:34:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Guindalen Jones transmits, "Sorry I spaced out."

03:34:45 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "For you!"

03:34:50 Tamra Swenson says, "Gift randomness."

03:34:52 Tamra Swenson laughs.

03:34:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Come into the lounge."

03:34:54 Lily Kaise says, "I will never forget showing up with not a single credit and that disposable clothing."

03:34:58 Guindalen Jones just arrived.

03:35:01 You grin.

03:35:01 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Wow!"

03:35:02 Guindalen Jones says, "Hi."

03:35:02 Lily Kaise waves to Guindalen Jones.

03:35:03 You hold Guindalen Jones's hand, taking her into your group.

03:35:05 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Hi to you!"

03:35:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:35:06 You wave.

03:35:07 Constantine Stone laughs.

03:35:10 Guindalen Jones grins.

03:35:12 Constantine Stone waves to Guindalen Jones.

03:35:15 Lily Kaise waves.

03:35:18 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:35:20 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Yep!"

03:35:22 Constantine Stone says, "Yes."

03:35:29 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

03:35:29 You can go up.
Tamra Swenson, Lily Kaise, Constantine Stone, and Guindalen Jones followed you.

03:35:32 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Airlock]

03:35:32 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Tamra Swenson, Lily Kaise, Constantine Stone, and Guindalen Jones followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:35:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd....yawn, but the...uh...association for clean airwaves....folks'd not be happy..."

03:35:33 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]

03:35:33 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a gray leather captain's chair, and a large leather couch here.
You can go south and out.
Tamra Swenson, Lily Kaise, Constantine Stone, and Guindalen Jones followed you.

03:35:37 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Okay."

03:35:43 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure."

03:35:48 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

03:35:52 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "That was somehow even more annoying. Good work."

03:35:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:35:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:35:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thanks!"

03:36:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:36:01 Lily Kaise glides south.

03:36:01 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I;have to agree with Foxhead."

03:36:02 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

03:36:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Praying Mantis, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:36:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well if you did not have bad breath perhaps they would not care."

03:36:06 Tamra Swenson walks south.

03:36:12 Constantine Stone walks south.

03:36:14 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "We need to stop at Accord so I can get beacons."

03:36:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:36:19 Tamra Swenson's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Weapons room 2."

03:36:19 "acord" does not match any known sector.

03:36:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs. "Vern, you have never smelt my breath."

03:36:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:36:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:36:24 Guindalen Jones asks, "What room should I take?"

03:36:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

03:36:26 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I don't have any sorry."

03:36:27 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Who says."

03:36:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:36:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:36:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:36:30 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
Lily Kaise grins.

03:36:31 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

03:36:31 You say, "Any weapon room."

03:36:32 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm in weapons room 1."

03:36:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:36:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:36:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:36:35 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:36:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I say."

03:36:36 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Bad breath is good for you, it keeps all enemies away from you!"

03:36:36 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

03:36:36 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Every time you talk dude....every time you talk."

03:36:37 Guindalen Jones nods.

03:36:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:36:37 You say, "Just grab one."

03:36:38 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:36:38 Guindalen Jones walks south.

03:36:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:36:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:36:40 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:36:41 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

03:36:42 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:36:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:36:42 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Ew."

03:36:42 Tamra Swenson's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Great."

03:36:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...no Evelyn..."

03:36:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:36:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:36:45 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:36:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:36:47 Tamra Swenson's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're settled."

03:36:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:36:52 Lily Kaise glides south.

03:37:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:37:18 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:37:23 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

03:37:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:37:28 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Be right back, don't go anywhere."

03:37:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

04:37:45 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:37:45 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:37:46 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:37:48 Tamra Swenson says, "Thanks for taking me."

04:37:48 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"

04:37:49 Bryan Stout ambles in from the south.

04:37:49 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:37:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:37:52 Tamra Swenson says, "That was very nice."

04:37:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:37:53 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:37:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:37:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:37:57 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:37:58 You smile. "Any time."

04:37:59 Tamra hugs the air.

04:38:00 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Praying Mantis! Welcome to home space!"

04:38:01 Tamra Swenson smiles.

04:38:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Praying Mantis. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:38:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:38:46 Tamra Swenson says, "Have a beautiful day."

04:38:47 Tamra Swenson smiles.

04:38:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:38:52 You are credited with 2,892,420.78 AEU credits of bounty.

04:39:35 You hear hammering and the chatter of technicians outside as the spaceport repairs the starship.

04:39:37 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Does anyone see my capsule above new earth?"

04:39:42 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "What."

04:39:47 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

04:39:47 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "What."

04:39:49 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It was probably tugged down if it was empty."

04:39:57 You peer out...

04:39:57 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Dreamstar", the five-person gunship "Praying Mantis", the one-person cargo hauler "Pretzel Paluza", and the one-person cargo hauler "Stubborn Mule" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.

04:40:18 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Well, it's where I landed it, but now I don't see it."

04:40:21 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:40:22 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:40:24 Lily Kaise exclaims, "That is stranger than strange!"

04:40:27 You say, "Yeah."

04:40:27 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Check the garage?"

04:40:31 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "I did."

04:40:39 You say, "Going to check."

04:40:41 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:40:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:40:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:40:44 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So I can look I mean."

04:40:46 Lily Kaise nods.

04:40:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Praying Mantis, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:40:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:40:51 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Checking."

04:41:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:41:00 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I had a ship that just randomly vanished on me one day. It got tugged down a few minutes later and I found nobody in it."

04:41:00 [Tactical Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Was it unlocked?"

04:41:05 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Don't see it."

04:41:10 There are no other ships in the sector.

04:41:15 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "No."

04:41:16 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "It was not unlocked, I have never unlocked my capsule."

04:41:17 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Not above New Earth."

04:41:26 Lily Kaise asks, "Well do you have the full long-rang on here?"

04:41:30 Lily Kaise asks, "Range?"

04:41:34 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Ain't Lolly Gaggin'" has jumped into the sector.

04:41:37 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Ain't Lolly Gaggin'! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

04:41:39 Lily Kaise says, "What the."

04:41:46 You say, "That's Morris's capsule."

04:41:49 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Ain't Lolly Gaggin'" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver cerami

04:47:36 Lily Kaise says, "I guess that is a vulnerability of the Capsule as I've tried to power down by accident when just about to land and gotten a warning message."

04:48:05 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:00:27 Lily Kaise says, "When we were at the aquarium, she didn't want to team up with anybody but she whined and carried on about how frustrated she was. Had she been more congenial and cooperative, we would have worked with her."

05:00:37 You say, "Definitely."

05:03:49 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

05:21:50 Lily Kaise says, "We all have our strengths and weaknesses."

05:22:01 You say, "I'm sure Ather would have cared less and just switched ships, but I saw how upset she was with herself. Then if she found we just switched ships because she didn't gun hardly at all... Exactly."

05:34:08 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins wiggles his hairy palps endearingly.

05:34:23 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I had to get rid of the majority of the felo I had in Star Kittens and I had issues with maned in there and unfortunately they killed some of the others."

05:34:29 You say, "Awww."

05:34:42 You say to Lily, "Oh, Tamera was asking about felo."

05:35:56 Shule runs his fingers though your hair.

05:36:03 You say to Lily, "Are you getting sleepy?"

05:36:23 Lily Kaise says, "Kittens used to be full of Sabre-Tooth but it's not been very stable for awhile. I'm trying to recreate them and the last ones all had cloudy or murky eyes for the most part too so that was a huge problem."

05:36:30 You say, "Awww."

10:39:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

10:39:58 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

10:50:44 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

10:50:45 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

10:51:22 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

10:51:22 This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face. It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however, possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.

10:52:50 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

10:52:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

10:52:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:53:04 The ship is already moving.

10:53:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

10:53:05 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

10:53:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:53:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:53:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:53:13 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

10:53:49 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

10:53:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Justen Moon. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

10:53:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

10:54:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

10:54:07 You pull a large lever towards you.

10:54:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

10:59:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

10:59:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:59:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

10:59:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

10:59:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:59:53 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

10:59:56 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:59:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:59:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:59:59 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

11:17:44 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

11:17:44 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

You can go south and out.

11:18:13 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

11:18:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

11:18:15 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:18:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Okay. I'm really starting to talk complete crap. Almost seventeen hours awake...Night pilots."

11:18:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Praying Mantis, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

11:18:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:18:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:18:31 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Night Eve."

11:18:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:18:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:18:39 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Night Eve."

11:18:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

11:18:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:18:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:18:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Night Eve."

11:18:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:18:48 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "Praying Mantis, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

11:18:49 You sit down on a gray leather captain's chair.

You can go south and out.

11:25:22 You can't go that way.

11:25:24 [Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]

11:25:25 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a gray leather captain's chair, and a large leather couch here.

11:26:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:26:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector W-62."

11:26:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:26:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:26:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:26:10 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

11:26:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:26:40 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

11:26:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Greetings, Praying Mantis. The Mutuality welcome you to this free port."

11:26:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

11:26:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

11:26:55 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:26:56 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:59:47 You say, "And two, none of my ships ever fired on his ships, that I can recall."

11:59:56 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Ok, were you aware of the message Cheri Lindburg forwarded to us via Eli Grey with regards to the allied pilots?"

12:00:02 You say, "No."

12:00:37 You ask, "Do you have a copy of it?"

12:00:49 You ask, "Or is there one somewhere I could read?"

12:00:53 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "The message Cheri forwarded? No, it was given verbally."

12:01:01 You say, "Ah, ok."

12:01:52 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "The second question I have. Do you remember that op, uh, I think it was the first of the new conquest? I came back in the sector in Morris's transport and Melinda's gunship was in sector for an op when some pirates arrived. It's the one where we then switched to the pincer so I could join defense, and where we were attacked by 2 rapids."

12:02:30 "I can't say that I do." You get a distant look on your face as you ponder. "I don't think I was on that op?"

12:04:02 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Read that, maybe then you remember."

12:04:06 --

12:04:06 Kim,

Below is a copy of the letter I have just sent off to Sir Wellington concerning this Allied Pirate issue.

During the course of the salvage op event that many pilots partook in, there was an understanding. Mutuality pilot Pierre Louis as well as AEU pilot Eli Gray brought us some information. We were told that the Allied Pirates would steer clear of the area seeing as Mutuality friends were in the area.

Due to the large number of IFS and Outsiders in the area, Mister Kelsey says that he had a group out there ready to defend. The incident that I recall is the following: Myself, Morris Corlew and Nicolette Lawrence were salvaging. Jason Rat, Bryan Stout, Emily Ford, Damien Goss and Shule Elemmire were aboard the gunship. I believe it was my gunship, "The Storm Petrel." The issue is that Mister Kelsey believes a cease fire was broken when the gunship fired upon his area defenders. I was waiting in the neighboring sector with the op can so have no idea who fired first or anything of that nature. I do believe that this was the op in which they had to switch ships to, a pincer called, "The Wolves have Claws," so that AEU pilot Kim Saunders could be added to the defense. I also believe that most of the pilots thought the pirates would not be getting involved in ops but did not realize they wouldn't be causing issues otherwise. At any rate, I am inquiring as to whether or not we can find out who fired first on behalf of
12:04:06  the Mutuality pilots. I plan to ask the pilots aboard the ship about this incident as well.

The other incident that I recall was during the early morning hours, I saw a couple of pirates come into the sector. I did launch my corvette and they promptly vacated the sector. I did not fire and was not fired upon.

12:04:30 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Melinda would like to know who fired first during that situation and she believes you were part of that crew."

12:05:23 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders removes a small black leather portfolio from a sturdy jungle camouflage canvas backpack for a moment.

12:05:23 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders puts a thick cream piece of paper with an official header reading "From the Voice of the League" in a small black leather portfolio.

12:05:43 As he peruses the letter, Shule frowns, "Well, apparently I was on that op. I don't recall it, but I don't remember who fired first."

12:06:24 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods. "It's all right."

12:06:35 You ask, "Can I keep this copy?"

12:07:00 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Yeah, you can. If something does come to your mind later, please let me know."

12:07:06 You say, "I will."

12:07:10 You put a thick cream piece of paper with an official header reading "From the Voice of the League" in a leather briefcase.

12:07:42 You say, "I don't think I was flying though. So..."

12:08:03 You say, "If we fired, it was most likely because we were fired upon."

12:08:09 You say, "But who knows."

12:08:14 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods.

12:09:06 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "My personal opinion is that we did not break any agreement as there was none. But apparently the Mutuality pilots are making a big fuss over this."

12:09:34 You say, "Well, that was going to be my other point. A verbal agreement, if there was one even made, isn't very binding."

12:09:59 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I will tell you what I know."

12:10:10 You nod to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.

12:12:00 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "On saturday, uh, what was the date, the 6th of may, Ather was about to head home, so it was in the evening, Eli came walking into the lounge. Ather wanted to talk with Eli and asked him to follow. A few minutes later, they both returned, and Ather asked Eli to tell us. That were his words, tell them. Then Eli said something like this: " Cheri asked me to tell you that Mr. Kelsey has agreed to stay out of this area while his mutuality friends are there.""

12:12:26 You nod.

12:13:33 You ask, "Ok, so if that was the case, why were Mr. Kelsey's pirates there in the first place?"

12:13:39 You frown.

12:14:02 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "The next day all mutuality pilots were gone. 2 days after that this op happened where his pirates arrived in sector."

12:15:12 You ask, "Ok, so it was the 8th then that this happened?"

12:16:04 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Uh, let me think, the 6th was the saturday, by the 7th all mutuality pilots had left, the 8th was the monday, uh it was either late on the 9th or early on the 10th."

12:16:13 You say, "Ah, ok."

12:17:27 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Well, thanks for the information. I will speak with Eli and see if he remembers more, and see if Ather also knows something additional."

12:17:39 You say, "Ok."

12:18:16 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Someone should have posted Cheri's news on the message board out there, I think everyone including myself was expecting someone else to do it, or who knows."

12:18:34 You say, "Yeah, it should have been posted."

12:18:37 You frown.

12:19:55 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "But then, if Cheri makes an agreement that involves us, she also should bring the news to us herself, include us in the decision making or at least have given Eli a written message."

12:20:22 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "After all, in a capsule it would have taken her no more than an hour."

12:20:25 You say, "Yeah, exactly. Actually, she should have included you at the very least since you are the Voice."

12:22:39 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods.

12:24:50 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

12:24:53 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Well, at least I know the story from your point of view."

12:25:01 You say, "Actually, I do remember that op."

12:25:06 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Ah."

12:25:19 You say, "Sorry, took me a bit to remember. We did quite a number of hem."

12:25:26 You say, "Erm them."

12:25:37 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders giggles. "25 in total."

12:25:42 You nod.

12:25:44 You say, "Exactly."

12:26:46 You say, "There were a Strike gunboat, and a couple of fighters there."

12:28:01 You say, "The op had not officially started."

12:28:18 You say, "Mel was about to drop the can, but hadn't yet."

12:29:01 You say, "Damien Goss was flying."

12:29:16 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Ah, interesting, I didn't know that."

12:29:25 You say, "When he saw the pirates, he immediately went to red and tracked."

12:29:29 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Although, hmm, wait, I think he then also flew the pincer."

12:29:34 You nod.

12:29:37 You say, "Yeah, he did."

12:29:52 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Did you also immediately open fire?"

12:31:32 You say, "Well, we all did. We didn't know if the pirates had locked on us or not. We just did what we're trained to do when the pilot goes to red and begins tracking a target."

12:32:14 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods.

12:32:19 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Ok."

12:32:29 You say, "So, the question is, did they lock on us first."

12:32:45 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Well, Goss should be able to shed some light on that."

12:32:51 You nod.

12:33:44 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I was in sector briefly, but in a transport I was not gonna stay around of course, certainly not someone else's transport."

12:33:51 You say, "For sure."

12:34:13 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Would you be willing to write your account down for me, so I can send it with Melinda?"

12:34:41 You say, "I certainly can. Give me a bit to recall as much as I can and I'll send it to you in a letter."

12:34:47 Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "To Melinda, I mean? After all, it's better that I to get it directly from you to prevent further he and she said things."

12:34:53 You nod.

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

To Whom It May Concern,

Below is my account of what I can recall of the events that transpired on the evening of May 9, 2317. Just prior to 2300, a group of us pilots, conducted a salvage operation. On this particular salvage operation, I was part of the defence team and was aboard the five-person hammerhead "The Storm Petrel". I was manning weapons room 3. the salvagers had already launched and Melinda Michaels had moved to the adjacent sector west of the beacon sector, but had not dropped the salvaging can as of yet.. Damien Goss flew this particular salvage operation. Soon after launching, Damien called out over the PA that pirates were present. At the same moment, the ship was put on red status and soon thereafter, the first ship began to be tracked by the ship's target tracking array. As soon as the ship went to red status, I scanned the sector to ascertain ship names and classes. According to the ship's sensors, aside from our salvager's ships, there were two five-person strike gunboats and two fighters in the sector. Due to the fact that the ship went to red status, I presumed that we were engaging and based on the sounds of the ship's weapons, so did the other gunners. Therefore, we all opened fire as is our training when the ship is put on red status and a ship is tracked. I have no idea if the pirates locked on our ship first or if we were the aggressor. If there are any more questions regarding this incident, p
13:27:33 lease feel free to contact me. I hope this is helpful.

Best Regards,
Shule Elemmire

13:34:14 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:34:15 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

13:34:31 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:34:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Justen Moon, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

13:34:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:34:43 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, they are not everywhere. I think only on sectors with a fairly high security, and on any temp station that has it equipped."

13:34:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:34:58 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:35:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:35:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

To Whom It May Concern,

Below is my account of what I can recall of the events that transpired on the evening of May 9, 2317. Just prior to 2300, a group of us pilots, conducted a salvage operation. On this particular salvage operation, I was part of the defence team and was aboard the five-person hammerhead "The Storm Petrel". I was manning weapons room 3. the salvagers had already launched and Melinda Michaels had moved to the adjacent sector west of the beacon sector, but had not dropped the salvaging can as of yet.. Damien Goss flew this particular salvage operation. Soon after launching, Damien called out over the PA that pirates were present. At the same moment, the ship was put on red status and soon thereafter, the first ship began to be tracked by the ship's target tracking array. As soon as the ship went to red status, I scanned the sector to ascertain ship names and classes. According to the ship's sensors, aside from our salvager's ships, there were two five-person strike gunboats and two fighters in the sector. Due to the fact that the ship went to red status, I presumed that we were engaging and based on the sounds of the ship's weapons, so did the other gunners. Therefore, we all opened fire as is our training when the ship is put on red status and a ship is tracked. I have no idea if the pirates locked on our ship first or if we were the aggressor. If there are any more questions regarding this incident, p
13:37:04 lease feel free to contact me. I hope this is helpful.

Best Regards,
Shule Elemmire

13:37:54 You put a sheet of white paper in a leather briefcase.

13:37:57 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Thanks for the tip!"

13:38:01 You pick up a small package.

13:38:27 You can go south.

13:38:29 [Residential Structure; ITPN Station; Main Circuit]

13:38:29 Like the docking bay to the south, this ITPN station appears to be wholly open to space, an illusion enabled by the use of a huge single piece of curved transparent plasteel. A metal viewing rail runs around the exterior of the semicircular space. At its center, the pod platform is positioned directly below a broad hole in the ceiling that leads up into open space. Pods arrive and depart through the hole with clockwork precision. Passengers disembark and load from a designated area at the top of some stone steps. Large displays hang from the ceiling and provide status updates.

13:38:34 [Residential Structure; Trading Center]

13:38:35 The trading center seems to be one of the busiest places in the spaceport. Which is not surprising, considering the profits that successful trading can bring in. Avoiding the automated computer terminals used by the career traders, you decide to approach a human trade clerk. This, incidentally, will also subject your purchases and sales to less scrutiny.

13:38:38 [Residential Structure; Mail Room]

13:38:38 One thing the Residential Structure has in profusion, if not large crowds, is mail. Letters and parcels overflow their racks and boxes and line the walls. Obviously many residents here take advantage of the nearby mail room. Several postal workers wander around, sorting mail by destination or inserting it in tubes to be delivered to the apartments above the spaceport.
You can go southwest.

Subject - Request to Petition for a Special Recall of Industrial Whip, Tatiana Kruppin
Pursuant to the recent events and subsequent contraversy involving Tatiana Kruppin and the crew of the Metal Heart Expedition along with our recent vote that Tatiana's report be overruled describing her experiences with the Metal Heart crew prior to being forced to evacuate the Metal Heart starship via Escape Pod, this is to request that a special Recall Vote be presented to the AEU Pilot Corps to remove Tatiana Kruppin's civilian liaison title of Industrial Whip and related responsibilities. Initially, though, if you would deem it reasonable, I would suggest that to avoid this complex formality, that Tatiana Kruppin is given the recommendation that she should voluntarily resign from her position of Industrial Whip.
Respectfully,
Lily Kaise, AEU Ground Squad Leader

13:47:03 You can't go that way.

13:47:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're approaching that first performance goal! Our penultimate victory is just ahead! Let's go, people! Go go go! Wow, you'd think all this cheerleading would be annoying, but it's not!"

13:47:08 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

13:47:08 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:50:10 [Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

13:50:53 [Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.
You can go north and south.

13:51:16 Your battlesuit is rolling along like there's no rollmorrow.

13:51:35 [Site 131288152; Surface] (inside a battlesuit)

13:51:35 You stand on the surface of Teslaworld. The levels of radiation and magnetic flux here play havoc with your battlesuit's electronics, obscuring all input in shifting levels of white noise. The sky is obscured by dark purple clouds, which flash several times a second with bolts of lightning. Markings on the ground show that this area has already been explored.
You can go down.

14:19:56 She appears to be 20 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is of average build with slightly curved hips and pleasantly curved calves. She has slender shoulders and average-sized breasts. Her face is long and girlish, with a wide nose and round chin. Her lips are faintly downturned and pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of plucked eyebrows, her eyes are blue and wide. Her mid-back length, wavy hair is dark blonde and drawn back in a ponytail. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a fierce pink and sapphire blue dinosaur mask with scowling eyes and jagged white teeth, a standard grey shipsuit, and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a charred metachannel FTL communicator, a small cloth sack, a plain flat einrophone in a dark gray leather phone holster, an indigo guitar case, and a black flightbag. Her head, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

14:19:57 Angela Caesar smiles.

14:20:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:20:07 You say, "And there ya go."

14:20:10 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

14:20:10 Angela Caesar says, "Thanks."

14:26:45 [Starship "Fearless"; Weapons Room]

14:26:45 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a swiveling black leather gunner's chair here.
You can go south and down.

14:26:47 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

14:26:47 You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go up and out.

14:26:48 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]

14:26:49 You can go out and enter into the ship.

14:26:49 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the spaceport.

14:26:53 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

14:26:53 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

14:26:56 You sit down.

14:26:56 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

14:26:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:26:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:26:58 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:27:00 You're already sitting.

14:27:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:27:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:27:10 The ship is already moving.

14:27:12 The ship is already moving.

14:27:13 The ship is already moving.

14:27:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:27:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to The Glittering Belt. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:27:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:27:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

14:27:18 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:36:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The Farport thing?"

18:36:45 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Where you can trade them in for a price."

18:36:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. Yeah, and it can be a pretty hefty price too."

18:37:09 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Yeah it was a billion something I think she said."

18:37:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Depends on your GCP."

18:37:22 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]

18:37:22 The one-person fighter "Dragonfly" and the vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

18:37:23 You can't go that way.

18:37:24 You can't go that way.

18:37:27 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

18:37:27 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

18:37:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's a lot more if you're further on."

18:37:28 You sit down.

18:37:28 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

18:37:31 [General Communication] Voice of the Fleet Nathaniel Owens transmits, "A billion and something to trade something? So, you pay to trade stuff?"

18:37:44 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

18:37:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:37:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:37:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:37:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You pay to deposit the glyph."

18:37:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:37:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:38:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:38:05 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:38:05 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:38:06 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

18:38:07 There appear to be 12 pilots recently active.

18:38:08 [General Communication] Voice of the Fleet Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I've never done GMG. How much gcp do you need to do it?"

18:38:09 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:38:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:38:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:38:12 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:38:13 You're already sitting.

18:38:13 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

18:38:14 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:38:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:38:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:38:18 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

18:38:20 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Shooting Star! Welcome to home space!"

18:38:21 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

18:38:22 --

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

18:38:22 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

18:38:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:38:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not much really. But if you don't have 300 exploration and 3000 industry it's not all that worth it."

18:38:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:38:40 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

18:38:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Shooting Star. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

18:38:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:38:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:39:00 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:39:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I can't remember now, I think if you have one and not both you get paid for the stations, but no artifacts or blueprints. But I don't recall if it's the industry or the exploration."

18:39:05 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I wouldn't say that necessarily."

18:39:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:39:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:39:36 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I went wiht just over 300 industry and I didn't get as much as I could have, but I still was able to get some supplies."

18:39:40 Your ship 'Shooting Star' has been automatically moved into a garage.

18:39:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well that's true. Supplies is it though."

18:40:04 [General Communication] Voice of the Fleet Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I wouldn't mind doing GMG at some point if anyone would be interested."

18:47:00 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "So quiet."

18:47:18 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 291,504.64 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.

18:49:00 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Hi."

18:50:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ha ha ha. Was talkin to Sarah."

18:50:05 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy laughs.

18:50:34 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "How's my moosey?"

18:50:48 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Generally I have a plan but today I have no idea what I want to do."

18:51:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm alright."

18:52:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Great, we've almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"

18:59:08 [General Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Oh, GMG? Hi Luja!"

19:03:55 [Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]

19:03:55 This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face. It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however, possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
(You are sitting.)

19:04:01 Not much to see out there.

19:04:03 You scramble to your feet.

19:15:59 You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
You can go south, up, and out.

19:17:24 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Any interest on nests?"

19:17:51 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "What tier?"

19:18:04 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I only have tiers 2, league and rental."

19:19:02 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, if we can get two others, I'll join."

19:19:38 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "That seems unlikely."

19:19:59 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah."

19:22:25 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]

19:22:25 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

From a phone-based holoemitter: The holoimage shows a bright flame shoot straight upwards, gradually changing shape into a bird.

19:25:10 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sorry Melinda, I had like six SSN packages after that op trip. I have started dreading going to the mail room."

19:25:14 From a phone-based holoemitter: Spinning, the fire bird creates the words AEU TODAY out of its own flame.

19:25:16 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

19:26:25 From a phone-based holoemitter: The man's hand traces lightly over the item, highlighting its features.

19:26:37 From a phone-based holoemitter: The camera pans slowly over a yellow cotton kimono. It covers both your shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, chest, back, abdomen, both hips, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, waist, and groin.

19:26:50 From a phone-based holoemitter: The man exclaims, "Just 14,999.99 EAOS credits and one of these could be yours!"

19:27:50 From a phone-based holoemitter: The man says, "Well, I've been Javier and this has been Tiffany. Please have a good afternoon."

19:28:02 From a phone-based holoemitter: The man and woman smile as the shot fades.

19:28:14 From a phone-based holoemitter: The bright orange Space Shopping Network logo fills the view. A phone number is underneath it: 1111-44248.

19:28:27 From a phone-based holoemitter: The shot transitions to show a well-dressed woman.

19:28:39 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman smiles. "Good afternoon. I'm Olive."

19:28:51 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman says, "Here we have a great item..."

19:30:38 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman says, "Usually, we list this item for 1,499.99 credits."

19:30:50 From a phone-based holoemitter: The woman exclaims, "But today, for a limited time only, we're proud to offer this item for just 749.99 credits! That's right, only 749.99 EAOS credits!"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

20:56:25 [Starship "Justen Moon"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a rare black EAOSian contoured couch here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:06:13 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

21:06:13 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be 'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a special application in character generation.

The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

21:41:10 This control room would look less out of place as an old atmospheric fighter cockpit. The controls are placed so that the pilot can recline and still be able to reach every control, as well as see out of the rounded viewport. The nose-mounted turrets extend into the pilot's eyeline, giving the illusion that one could aim them by eye. There is a small amount of standing room behind the pilot's controls. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a black leather sofa here.
You can go south and out.

21:41:54 There appear to be 16 pilots recently active.

22:20:40 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:20:40 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:20:43 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:20:46 [General Communication] Alexandra Rose transmits, "Hi."

22:20:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Unicorn, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:20:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:20:50 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Hello."

22:20:54 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Hello."

22:20:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:21:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:21:01 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:21:02 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

22:21:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:21:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:21:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:21:08 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:21:09 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

22:21:14 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:21:16 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Unicorn! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

22:21:41 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Hi."

22:21:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:21:43 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 188! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

22:22:06 The ship's current engine speed is 6857 km/s.

22:22:07 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 12.2 seconds.

22:22:10 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 188" has landed on the planet Old Earth.

22:22:14 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "About to land."

22:22:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:22:15 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:22:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Unicorn. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

22:22:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:22:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:22:30 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:22:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:22:31 [Starship "Unicorn"; Airlock]

22:22:31 You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:22:32 You exit the ship.
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]

Tamra Swenson is sitting on a comfortable wooden chair. Bryan Stout, Nathaniel Owens, Jacob Smitt, and Evelyn Devereaux are standing here.
You can go out.

22:22:36 Bryan Stout says, "I don't care either way."

22:22:45 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Hi toyou, shule, I read your letter. Thanks!"

22:22:55 You smile at Tamra Swenson.

22:23:02 Your ship 'Unicorn' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:23:03 You say to Tamra, "Hi and no problem."

22:23:08 Nathaniel says to Bryan, "That would be grate. I'll pay to use it, too, if you want."

22:23:09 Bryan Stout says, "That wing wasn't fully upgraded by the way. I'd prefer to take a fully upgraded gunship."

22:23:11 Tamra Swenson grins.

22:23:19 Bryan Stout says, "You're not paying."

22:23:21 Bryan Stout chuckles.

22:23:22 Nathaniel Owens says, "I am using a different wing now."

22:23:26 Bryan Stout holds Nathaniel Owens's hand, taking him into his group.

22:23:28 Bryan Stout holds your hand, taking you into his group.

22:23:29 Bryan Stout holds Tamra Swenson's hand, taking her into his group.

22:23:33 Bryan Stout holds Jacob Smitt's hand, taking him into his group.

22:23:35 Tamra Swenson stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

22:23:35 Nathaniel Owens says, "That was the one I had access to at the time."

22:23:48 Bryan Stout asks, "Are we all ready?"

22:23:52 You say, "Yep."

22:23:58 Tamra Swenson says, "Yes."

22:24:00 Bryan says to Evelyn Devereaux, "Oh!"

22:24:04 Bryan says to Evelyn Devereaux, "Are you also in for beacons?"

22:24:10 Evelyn Devereaux says, "Yes."

22:24:21 Bryan says to Nathaniel, "You're now flying a pincer, be afraid."

22:24:21 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

22:24:21 Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people. The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.

[Starship "The Wolves Have Claws"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

23:42:03 [Starship "Unicorn"; Control Room]

23:42:03 This control room would look less out of place as an old atmospheric fighter cockpit. The controls are placed so that the pilot can recline and still be able to reach every control, as well as see out of the rounded viewport. The nose-mounted turrets extend into the pilot's eyeline, giving the illusion that one could aim them by eye. There is a small amount of standing room behind the pilot's controls. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a wormhole drive tracer and a black leather sofa here.
You can go south and out.

23:42:05 Not much to see out there.

23:42:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "Greetings new voice." Ryo Stel chuckles. "I'm ryo. But my friends call me Ryo, you can call me... Ryo."

23:42:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hello Ryo."

23:42:28 Not much to see out there.

23:42:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Greetings shule!"

23:43:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:43:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:43:41 You peer out...

23:43:41 
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The one-person cargo hauler "Salvaging Debris" and the one-person runabout "Unicorn" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

23:43:43 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:43:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Unicorn, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

23:43:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:43:52 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 188" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

23:43:54 I can't find "chair."

23:43:55 Starships In Sector:

23:43:56 
Registered Merchant 188.................(11, 11, 14)
Intense Focus...........................(20, 9, 16)

23:43:57 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 188" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

23:43:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:43:58 "sofa" does not match any known sector.

23:43:59 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 188" has landed on the planet Old Earth.

23:44:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:44:01 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:44:02 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:44:03 You sit down on a black leather sofa.

23:44:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:44:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:44:07 There appear to be about 24 pilots recently active.

23:44:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:44:09 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:44:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:44:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:44:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:44:13 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:44:14 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

23:44:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

23:44:16 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Unicorn! Welcome to home space!"

23:44:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:44:32 The starship is already moving.

23:44:35 The ship's current engine speed is 9600 km/s.

23:44:35 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 8.7 seconds.

23:44:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:44:39 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:44:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:44:56 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:44:56 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:44:59 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:45:28 Your ship 'Unicorn' has been automatically moved into a garage.

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:54:19 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

23:54:19 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo here.

23:55:23 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

23:55:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

23:55:44 Your communicator reports that...

23:55:44 
At least one recently active pilot is relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

23:55:48  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

23:55:48 You are carrying a secondary pilot command access unit in your right hand.

23:55:52 [MTTS] Butchulla: Nice. Thanks hosts.

23:56:51 I don't understand that.

Added a help file for the Glyphmakers' Graves. Since the activity is meant to be one that more experienced characters discover when they're ready, it mostly just covers common knowledge.

23:57:25 Star Conquest Help: Glyphmakers Graves
--
Category: Activities
--
The Glyphmakers' Graves are the remnants of an alien civilization found in a particular region of deep space. As far as anyone can tell, they mostly left behind thousands of small outpost stations of an unknown purpose. Their written language appears to be primarily based on shape and color, hence the name Glyphmakers.

While their stations have valuable materials and technology that can be salvaged, they are also still protected by robotic defenses, and Accord guidelines recommend that each station be boarded by a pair of battlesuit-equipped explorers. The Gemini Assault Class scout is perfectly suited to this mission profile.

The Glyphmakers were particularly skilled at circuit miniaturization, a technology that humankind has been slow to develop. Construction guidelines found at their stations use the universal language of simple mechanical engineering, and are relatively easily interpreted by any technologically-inclined human in order to adapt Glyphmaker salvage into new useful applications. In other words, Glyphmaker stations contain blueprints and insights for new items and the materials with which to build them.

Theme note: Items made with Glyphmaker blueprints should not be thought of as strictly alien technology -- rather, you are reinterpreting their instructive documents for your own purposes. For example, Glyphmakers did not develop se
23:57:26 rvice robots that look human and speak a human language, but materials they left behind will help you to build these yourself. Similarly, Glyphmakers may or may not have had rift drive technology, but alien guidelines and devices for manipulating electromagnetic fields will help you develop rift sail extenders.

A rift drive is required to reach the Glyphmakers' Graves, meaning that exploring their stations is decidedly NOT an activity for newer characters. You will be served best by waiting until you qualify for a rift drive yourself, at 300 exploration points or 3000 industry points, before you begin exploring these stations.

The location of the Glyphmakers' Graves is not a secret, but the information is beyond the scope of this help file. Please discover it by interacting with other characters. Since the activity requires a partner, someone will likely be quite eager to teach you how it is done!
