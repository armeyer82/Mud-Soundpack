04:10 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Kitty to Tibo - 8-6-2363]

My Dearest Love,
First off, I haven't had a link with Fawkes in literally months.
As for Cria, I rarely have spoken with him with the very rare
chance that I am on HiGuard for a mission. This has been probably
a couple of months ago. So do not! accuse me of kissing anybody's
butt Tibo. I just try to get along with them by not being caustic
or hostile and sometimes just plain old avoidance is what you have
to do. I truly don't think though that I am safe around any of
them and I'm sure they will likely try to take advantage of me when
they have the opportunity to do so. I don't know why too you would
even imply that i bother to pay anyone to cause you any harm. I
don't work that way and especially towards someone i love as much
as i love you. The only time I will go aggressive towards anyone
is when they have first attacked me. Even then, I generally just
move on as it's not worth the aggrevation until I find that
individual when they least expect it and return by breaking their
bones! Then I owe them absolutely nothing and being nice isn't my
plan! Otherwise, as you know, I'd rather make love than war as I
so want to make love with you.
I will tell you though that you have a bit of manning up to do and
I know you don't like it but still, when others see one flying
around in a gunship, their assumption is and always will be that
they are wanting to fight or at least are able to defend their
starship. Believe me if you want to but I have had enough years of
having my bones broken, ships stolen, attempts at extortion and
blown up ships to decide that I am not going to be a prisoner in my
ship, etc unless I have other reasons for not coming out. When I
am able to work, I go about my business and I face the consequences
of whatever is in my path. I am not the combat pilot I used to be
so I know I can't defend a gunship as I once could so guess what, I
choose not to fly a ship around which costs a few billion credits.
That makes no sense! I'd rather lose one which I have 100
million invested in which is more expendable as it is a hostile
Universe out there and is not likely to ever change. So your
stating you got shot at in your Expediter comes across as whining.
Hey you sure have a short memory when it comes to things.
remember one of my own Expediters launched right into a mine field.
That same Expediter was shot at several times but did it stop me
when I was more active? I was just angry concerning how very new
pilots who only had a few credits earned were in the line of fire.
I just would either accept my loss and go buy another one or use
one I have in reserve as I keep a few. I can tell you lots of
stories of being entrapped and other things but it's no reason to
blame the universe for all of my problems. People respect you
moreso when you at least try to look at your own actions and decide
to just keep doing what you do and to accept the consequences or
use a different strategy. This is probably why you have been
called a coward and no I didn't hear this from Cria or Fawkes
because I absolutely do not communicate with them privately. Nope.
So love, I don't think you deserve any sympathy over your losses
based upon poor judgement. Nobody has given me any except to
perhaps offer to sell me another ship which I may or may have not
accepted. I am sorry for your losses but not still for what I
consider chosing the wrong time of day to go out of locals. Still,
rather than hold yourself accountable all I heard in your letter
was blame this one and blame that one and nothing about hey what
could have i done to evade them or to choose a time to depart or to
not let anyone know when I was leaving/ You know I never tell
anybody what my plans are either and I I showed you measures which
I hope you observed en route. There are pilots whose sport is to
challenge anyone who will to combat. Although it is inconvenient
to us, that's their sport and when you take it personally, this
just feeds their egos. Haven't you heard Anton challenging others
before? For him, it's fun and although you don't see it that way
and I find it to be a royal pain in the butt, that is how it is.
so i certainly understand wanting to take a stronger ship into
Sector 12 if there is an Invasion but there is also the ITPN
particularly when there is that much hostile activity in the
sector. A good practice too is that BCs should actually be taken
to Jump Hub or another neutral location as well to crew but isn't
always done. So don't point fingers at me! I'm trying to relate
some practical survival advice to you yet you always seem to resent
it when someone like myself has had a bit of life and survival
experience and your not wanting to accept and to listen will not
help you much. only you can decide that perhaps there are others
who do know something based upon real experience.
As for the exact circumstances of your lost gunship, still, you
need to step back and get off of the defensive and accept it that
you indeed made tactical errors. That if others such as myself
consider how you mis-managed things don't agree with you, then that
is how it is. It does not mean that I love you any less. However,
I'm not very impressed with the logic behind what you have done at
times. You have lost two gunships in less than a half a year. I
sympathize with the loss of your droids as that was just a mean-
spirited thing on the part of that jerk.
As I have told you before, going to a commonly hunted ground out of
37 is not wise. If you do so, then you need to be willing to take
on the adversities. It is unfortunate but it is just a reality of
being a pilot in this universe. Nobody promised us that we would
live a perfect life here without any challenges.
As for going out of locals, you know I don't do that to run away
but because i enjoy it. still, others perception of you is when
you are angry or upset, that is what you do. As it's typical of
others who are newer pilots and don't engage in pilot versus pilot
combat. I'm not saying you should, just what is the perception
right or wrong.
You know exactly why I choose to go where nobody else goes to
Aquatic, Atmo and Gas salvage. Although it would be fun to be in a
community setting, it's just asking to be attacked so why put
yourself in that position? It's like here I am boys and girls!
come get me! That makes no sense at all! However, if you can
defend your ship and resources, then go where you want to go and be
ready to fight if you have to.
You need to remind yourself exactly why I wanted to take you out of
Locals as it was to enjoy some quality time with you and to not
have any interference so that we could make an attempt to work out
our differences.
Since I had so little quality time withyou until you ran off with
that self-serving individual who yes, how hypocritical, is not
available as much as i was and am. You said she was right by your
side heh well after what 4 days she hasn't been right there by your
side? So a very unfounded justification to hold over my head. I
might have been away for a day or so but I always came right back
to be right there with you. On many occasions, I would be
available for you and wait for at least an hour or two for you to
come home and then it seemed convenient that you wanted me to
become more intimate when you well knew I would sleep soon. It
makes me wonder if it's you who didn't want to take the time to
become more intimate. Still Love, I'd truly like to know what it
would be like to make love with you.
As for supporting you and upholding your dignity, then you will
always have every ounce of my very being to support you if I truly
know that you are using your head and reasonable judgement. Then
you are dignified and deserve to be respected. If you were still
here so I could be by your side, yes I would fight for you but I
nor anyone can't fight battles over circumstances that you created.
You know that I was not in favor of your joining Insanity but you
did so without even discussing it and I suppose had you done so
and I opposed it, that you would have just stomped out angrily,
slammed the door and then perhaps I could just say 'I told you so'.
You know I was initially tempted to join but thought better of it
as I knew that all they would want to do would be to exploit me.
That is one thing that Matt never did to me nor anyone in Force.
He didn't like families and cliques either although couples were
ok. He had some very sound ideas and he did not exploit anyone but
one thing about Matt which was of utmost importance is loyalty. I
did not get the sen
04:10 se that Cria or Fawkes cared anything about
loyalty which is another reason I did not choose to join. I will
likely remain as a member of Force until it is gone or if Matt
comes back and a group of great pilots and a few pirates band
together once again.
So sorry my sweet love, love is tough at times and it should be
because if I continuously supported certain aspects, then how do
you consider this to help you out? It is what they call enabling.
That is not support. Still, if Ihappened to be flying with you and
you were under attack, I wouldn't just sit back and let it happen
to you. If you are implying that I can do anything about Cria and
Fawkes, well sorry Love, I'm in no better circumstances than you.
I know that ifever i let my guard down, they will find a way to
take advantage. When they do though, I will either find a means to
retaliate which is highly unlikely or accept the consequences and
reflect and consider what I should do and defintiely should do
different to prevent a reoccurance of the same circumstances. I
may not succeed but there is nobody to blame but myself for
creating a situation for myself which left me vulnerable. I
wouldn't blame you as you are so hurtfully are blaming me for your
problems. I am accountable to Kitty and if someone loves her and
is available to help her then she is forever grateful. If they
aren't or choose not to, then I don't hold it against them.
You have a lot of potential tibo and I do have a lot of respect and
faith in you but you won't go forward by continuing to wallow in
your current state of self-pity. I find it very sad too as I so
want you to stand proudly and not take on the role of a stupid
victim.
I will love you forever for you though even though you have gone
out of your way to be cruel to me for circumstances which are
seemingly now more apparent but which I have had absolutely no
control over nor involvement in. I will swear it on every star in
this universe that I have never done anything to cause any harm to
you. I don't treat a man I love or anyone I love in such a manner
as that.
I love you.
Your forever faithful,
Kitty

My Dearest Love,
Well it is so hard to write letters like this. We really need to be face to face and talk things over. I know that we have both made a lot of assumptions because you ended things so abruptly without even talking with me this is what started this chain of awfulness.
Please my Love, please do not end your career until we have at least gotten together in person to talk face to face. You owe it to yourself and I should honestly pray to the stars that you would think that I'm worth it.
Yes, take that woman back to where she belongs and then i'll be waiting for you.
I will be more than happy to accompany you to go back out of locals if this is what you want to do to earn funds to replace things or whatever but ew must please, we must get together face to face. writing letters does not convey the proper tone nor expression and it's not fair to either of us not to try.
I love you and will forever and there will be no other man for me.
I love you,
Kitty

04:44 A high-capacity transparent Lore computer

04:44 This small and surprisingly hefty handheld computer device sports a compact brightly-lit touch-screen display and an on-demand virtual input keypad. The stylistic open book logo of LoreTech Industries, Inc. edifies the metallic backing of the device.  A Loretech biometric expansion card, a Loretech printer expansion, an image data extraction card, a Loretech TransLink expansion card, a Loretech OCR expansion card, a Loretech speech synthesis expansion card, and a Loretech holographic imaging card occupy seven expansion slots on the device.  It has three hardware expansion slots remaining.

You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

My Dearest Love,
Well it is so hard to write letters like this. We really need to be face to face and talk things over. I know that we have both made a lot of assumptions because you ended things so abruptly without even talking with me this is what started this chain of awfulness.
Please my Love, please do not end your career until we have at least gotten together in person to talk face to face. You owe it to yourself and I should honestly pray to the stars that you would think that I'm worth it.
Yes, take that woman back to where she belongs and then i'll be waiting for you.
I will be more than happy to accompany you to go back out of locals if this is what you want to do to earn funds to replace things or whatever but ew must please, we must get together face to face. writing letters does not convey the proper tone nor expression and it's not fair to either of us not to try.
I love you and will forever and there will be no other man for me.
I love you,
Kitty

Assists
--------------------------------------------------
Within Miriani, you may find that you need help that cannot be provided by questions on the general communications channel or by information contained within the help files. For times such as this, we provide HLEP.

HLEP is both a command and a group, known as the Helpful Liaisons Enacting Progress, whose goal is to ensure that Miriani runs smoothly. When you find yourself in a situation that cannot be resolved through in character means or you've encountered a bug that needs immediate attention, type HLEP (or ASSIST.).

Do not assist on any matters that you can handle yourself. If, however, you have come across a bug that makes you unable to continue your actions, please assist. Any bug that is not serious, such as a salvage container that won't break upon dropping it, would be better taken care of by REPORTing it to us. It is also alright to assist to ask any questions about policies or the game itself. However, it is not okay to assist to ask information about any other characters or for any unfair help. Please do not cancel and assist again repeatedly. If we're not responding, we're not ignoring you, we're just not available or there is nobody around who is qualified to answer your specific question. Do not assist about any subjects that you have already gotten an answer on, for example if we tell you it is not okay for you to get a second character, it is 
19:20 still not okay.

If you're assisting to report a policy violation, please ensure that you have a thorough understanding of the policy that you're reporting. A few common examples of things that do not violate policy and should not be assisted about are: in-game "bullying", being stunned for less than 6 hours, being insulted over the communicator, or losing a starship through in-character means.

19:22 --------------------------------------------------
Reports
--------------------------------------------------
REPORT is a tool used for bug reporting only. Things you should NOT report:

* I love you.
* Suggestions/Ideas. If you REPORT your ideas, we are much more likely to skip them in favor of finding bugs. This means your idea either never gets read or it gets read and forgotten. You will find we're much more receptive to ideas that are posted on the message board.
* Communicating with hosts. If you want to talk to a host, ASSIST. Or, if you want to have a general discussion with the hosts, the Gameplay Concerns board is a good place to do this.

Also, when you report something, please try to provide as much specific information as possible. Also describe the problem the best as you can. If you're posting a log of the event, PLEASE include a description of the problem before the log. Also, please do not offer code suggestions in reports. While we appreciate your willingness to make Miriani a better place with your experiences, you do not know how our game is coded or how the systems work. Offering code suggestions is, more times than not, counterproductive. A well-written description is better than a code suggestion any day.

And finally, don't be rude. We run Miriani in our free time and, as all humans, we make mistakes. That's the point of having a report command, afterall. It helps nobody if you act disparagingly.

20:19 
My Dearest Love,
Well it is so hard to write letters like this. We really need to be face to face and talk things over. I know that we have both made a lot of assumptions because you ended things so abruptly without even talking with me this is what started this chain of awfulness.
Please my Love, please do not end your career until we have at least gotten together in person to talk face to face. You owe it to yourself and I should honestly pray to the stars that you would think that I'm worth it.
Yes, take that woman back to where she belongs and then i'll be waiting for you.
I will be more than happy to accompany you to go back out of locals if this is what you want to do to earn funds to replace things or whatever but ew must please, we must get together face to face. writing letters does not convey the proper tone nor expression and it's not fair to either of us not to try.
I love you and will forever and there will be no other man for me.
I love you,
Kitty

23:43 A high-capacity transparent Lore computer

23:43 This small and surprisingly hefty handheld computer device sports a compact brightly-lit touch-screen display and an on-demand virtual input keypad. The stylistic open book logo of LoreTech Industries, Inc. edifies the metallic backing of the device.  A Loretech biometric expansion card, a Loretech printer expansion, an image data extraction card, a Loretech OCR expansion card, a Loretech speech synthesis expansion card, and a Loretech holographic imaging card occupy six expansion slots on the device.  It has four hardware expansion slots remaining.

23:44 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Welcome to your new Lore computer!]

23:44 
Congratulations on the purchase of your brand new Lore computer from LoreTech Industries.

The new line of Lore computers features several new advanced editing features over the pre-existing filing computers.

1) When editing files, you will be given the option to append your new data, rather than always overwriting.
2) You can export files from one location, and re-import them into new folders.

Note that any incoming files resulting from the use of TransLink hardware will also end up in the export memory, and must be imported into the folder of your choice. The export memory will hold files indefinitely, but they will not be accessible for viewing or editing.

Remember to check back with LoreTech Industries often for new hardware and applications.

Best Regards,
LoreTech Industries
