-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named
Nellie, an insulated orange cooler, a small white trash bin, a compact red
refrigerator, an insulated blue cooler, a high tech silver star print holovid, a
red plastic food storage container, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a
pocket-sized purple holovid, and Jewel the large violet glowing felo here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

[Newbie Help] Sausage Lover Michael King transmits, "Not sure if here is where
to ask, but for asteroid mining, it has all these upgrades to research for more
drones, but when I get them, I still have the same amount, am I missing
something?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "You need to upgrade the drones."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "You should get new buildings to do that,
when you do the research."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "They do cost some material, but
specialized drones can be very useful in the right situation."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, there is a very handy mining book
on the market."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Okay people. I am looking at
including QE shorthand codes for specific ships in the next update of the QE
book."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Specific ships?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'm thinking at a minimum I
should include all the ships that can be equipped with standard QE
communicators."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That page that's missing, were
you going to put it back in? The modifier codes?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yeah, specific ones."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "No, I still hate the modifier
code idea."
Xavier the big silver soldier felo marches in from the north.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, in the updated copy, it
was still in the contents, that's why I wondered."

[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I thought I fixed it already,
but I'll make sure it's fixed this time."

every time someone gets a galleon, you'll have to fix the book."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I don't know when you'll be
doing that, Akemi, but I know we're heading out soonish, so you may wanna
include that ship."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It's not a huge deal to update
the book periodically."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "NOST."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Anyway, I wanted to ask, do you
all think it'd be worthwhile to include smaller exploration ships too?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Less romantic than that,
Aisling. These codes will be like, VV01 or VVN4 or whatever, depending on how
many ships we end up including."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, I'll say there's a use
for at least a one character code that lets folks know it's a modifier...like if
you're requesting a hypercast from a station and not the Torus...or something
else like that."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Better to just include a new
code for that situation."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I would, I mean...It's
better to have the code, than to not have it, and need it, right?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The idea is to make the codes as
unambiguous as possible."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Modifying codes introduces more
opportunity for mistakes, so it's a non-starter."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Like if you're requesting a
hypercast but not from the Torus...from say...coreward, it would be H6 X
SECR...X being the modifier code."

[Newbie Help] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It may not show every ship, though."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Going anywhere in particular, or
is it a sightseeing trip?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "A bit of both, Akemi, that,
seeing what we can see, and hunting for the monastery."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Just get someone with it marked
on their chart to guide you there. You won't find it without help."
[General Communication] Austin Jamison transmits, "Monastery? I've been out for
long time."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "They don't have any active

did you ever visit temple about amulet?"

[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Do you have a QE device in it?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz chuckles.
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "What does that matter?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It docks in my explorer."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Which does have QE."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Akemi was asking about adding
ships with QE devices to her book."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "She is asking about adding
smaller ships too, actually."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Pay attention."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, ".. Smaller ships with QE
devices."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Unless I'm mistaken?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Smaller ships which are likely
to be referred to in QE communication."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Ah, that might count then."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Could have a general 'Smaller
ship that was with bigger ship' code."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Which would mostly be the scouts
and other small ships with exploration-grade sensors, but a case can be made for
module transports too."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Carriers as well, I suppose."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's a lot of ships."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Not really."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "It would indeed be a lot of
ships."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It's probably less than 1,300
ships."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Probably."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I think she is meaning
frequently used ships."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Putting even 100 ships in the
book...would take forever to sort through..."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "What Morris said. Big
exploration beasties fit my idea of 'not going to ruin anyone's sanity'."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz chuckles.
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "How often are exploration
ships out together?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "You could make, say, five
generic codes."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "As ship goes out, assign
code to it on board."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "People aren't going to do that."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "And then have subcodes to
refer to any docked ships on it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm guessing this stems from
my QE that referred to a ship out of comms referred to as IH..."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "This is your fault, be ashamed."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando laughs.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a dusky pink rattan
cabinet, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy

and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple
and light purple cloth rug, a small seashell pink trash can, a small red ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a small oval turquoise rattan
table with a glass top, and a pair of white cotton briefs here.

day or week or whatever."

the alpha salvage station."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'm telling you, just set up a
stun trap and track the number of complaints."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson laughs.
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "It's a good idea."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I agree and it's not needed for
salvage ops so don't know why Melinda made such a big deal out of that. It's
easy enough to take the can back to Orion because everyone needs to go back
eventually."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Won't work. Stun traps are good
for only two shots at a time, alas."

just a joke."

before remembering tha they were only good for two shots at a time."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I personally think one in 777 is a
better alternative and will serve new and more experienced pilots."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'd have to stay on the station
and constantly rearm and reload it."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I might play with them all the
next few days and see what I think."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Now will they use it? Who knows but I
have seen it used somewhat already and am going out shortly to salfage a load or
two."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "That might get tricky after the
first couple of people set it off."
'Yeah, i might head out there myself here in a bit.

Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Cool! Then I'll more than likely do
the salvaging missions if I can find time. If beacons happen though, that would
be great!"
Lily Kaise opens an insulated orange cooler and the light inside clicks on.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well I mean if one person uses
that station it would be lovely...for that one person. However, if it doesn't
bring enough income to justify the credits spent for the organizations
contributing to it especially the ones giving the more costly modules like the
salvage processor itself, then there is a problem. I think in terms of profit,
though. So don't mind me if there is another end goal!"
'Yeah, I'll probably do some salvaging and then call for beacons.
You say, "Yeah, I'll probably do some salvaging and then call for beacons."

'I think I'll head out there now. I need to nap around 1700.
You say, "I think I'll head out there now. I need to nap around 1700."
A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment,
then jets off.
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "There's eggs I've never even
seen on space market. Like white, or dark gray. But that's me who wants a pair
for breeding purposes..."
[General Communication] Carley Jamison transmits, "What are we breeding? Last
time I was around it was mainly felo."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Xenofish it sounds like."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I do wish we could sell them for less
though. I put up a few here and there not becasue I care about making money but
just want to make some available. I've generally sold all that I ever put up
though."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Holy crap."

are other than light blue green and purple, dark purple, orange, black, semi
transparent, dark gray and white, are there any other kinds of eggs? That we
know of."
[General Communication] Carley Jamison transmits, "Hey."

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

He appears to be 26 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has
olive skin. His body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. He has
average-sized shoulders and a wide chest. His face is average-shaped and
handsome, with a broad nose and strong chin. His lips are thin and tan and
occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of arched
eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and round. His shoulder-length, straight hair
is blonde and neatly trimmed over the ears and parted on the side. He has large
brownish fingernails.
 He is wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee with a large white lightning bolt
appliqued on the front, a pair of relaxed fit light khaki cargo pants, and a
pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. He is also wearing a keychain, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a gold
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a
backpack. His head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
He is carrying a cup of hot French vanilla coffee in his right hand, and a large
wedge of coffee cake topped with apple streusel in his left hand.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

l angel
Angel Martin
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and ten inches tall and
has golden honey brown skin. Her body is slender yet curvy with attractively
curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and somewhat large
breasts. Her abdomen is flat and toned and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face
is heart-shaped and lovely, with an arched nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are
full and pouty and applied with sheer pale pink lipstick, and occasionally part
to reveal a set of glamorously white teeth. Pale pink blush is applied to her
cheeks. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes are sparkling
blue-green and almond-shaped, and enhanced with black eyeliner and shimmering
emerald eyeshadow. She has subtle black mascara. Her shoulder-length,
luxuriously curly hair is jet black with flame red highlights and hanging in
loose, tousled ringlets. She has neatly-trimmed and carefully shaped painted
gold-flecked emerald fingernails. She has a small interestingly-shaped birthmark
on her right cheek.
A dainty white gold stirrup decorated with a row of small emeralds pierces her
belly button, a sparkly white gold ring with a diamond heart suspended from it
pierces her right earlobe, and a sparkly white gold ring with a diamond heart
suspended from it pierces her left earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue cropped top with a gold 'XX' embroidered across the
front, a delicate white gold watch with emerald accents, a stonewashed light
blue denim miniskirt with a saucy red 'XX' embroidered on the back pocket, and a
pair of gold slingback sandals. She is also wearing an emerald green touch
einrophone in a light brown leather phone holster, a glittery camera with a
chain link strap, an orange digital felo game, a black digital felo game, a
delicate necklace of perfectly matched heart-shaped sapphires nested in
diamonds, an emerald green silk handbag embroidered with gold butterflies, and a
cheap worn coin purse. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, abdomen,
both forearms, left wrist, both hands, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and
both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

[Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a

[Starship "Shadowsong"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot
labeled "Space Invaders", a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Butlaugh."
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
Lily Kaise chuckles.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Tugboats woo."
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.

Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2173 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Eastnortheast and Slightly Up."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello

You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Allowing
external rift insertion. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."
The ship is suddenly grasped by powerful EMMs from a nearby temporary space
station.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy

[Starship "Shadowsong"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

A few friendly reminders for new pilots.
Well, since we sort of talked about the concerns for new pilots who might be
traveling to alpha 777, here a few tips.
from b-24 to there, or back, is approximately 9 lightyears, which you will be
traveling by rift flow. For more information on the rift drive and flow, there
are a few books available on space market. the short version is, your travel
time is going to vary between reasonably fast (15 to 20 minutes) to very slow
(an hour or potentially more). As a newer pilot, you do not yet have the points
for your own rift drive, which gives you the control to stop and turn back if
the flow is too much against you. Instead, you will be using an accelerator with
inserter, so once you start traveling towards 777, or any similar temporary
space station, you can not stop. Make sure your charge is sufficient and that
you have a good number of charge boosters on your person for emergencies.
For successful artifacting, you need a jet and nav aid, available from the
xenology centre at the torus. These require 200 industry points. An autovector
unit at 300 industry will make artifacting easier as you can go from sector to
sector automatically. For information on artifact detectors, well I'm sure one
of us could help you with that so ask when the time comes.
I can't remember when a grapple for grade 30/40 becomes available, but probably
this will also be somewhere close to 200 industry. If you are a real new cadet,
you are probably going to find a lot of good debris much closer to home.
I can't remember when a grapple for grade 30/40 becomes available, but probably
this will also be somewhere close to 200 industry. If you are a real new cadet,
you are probably going to find a lot of good and more easily salvageable debris
much closer to homme.
Maybe it does not need saying, but stay alert while traveling, especially when
you get close to your destination. Pirates may be present in sector when you
arrive and will definitely attack you if your ship is floating with you asleep.
Alpha 777 does have a recharge station and repair and rearm which will be
maintained during this test.
For loads of good tips for staying safe in space, Ather's a pilot guide to
preparation is a good read. You can find his book on space market or in your
local book store.
Last. If something is unclear, if you need help or have questions? Just ask. I
had to ask and learn all sorts of new things when I was a new pilot, we all did,
and most of us will be glad to help.
I hope this post has been helpful to someone, and I wish you all a nice day!

Be absolutely certain that you return from the Beaconed Sector or you will
likely see a trek of over an hour versus the appropriate time. So to go to 777
leave from B-24
Return be sure you are in the Artifact alpha 777 Sector and if you need to
return to the Artifact alpha 777 Sector itself use Artifact and choose Artifact
Alpha 777. There is a strange issue with entering just 777 into the control
board.

three short holoclips: blonde hair flying in the face of Eric Best as he rages
violently at the sky, his holographic spittle spraying the air; hate in the eyes
of Kaisa Rebane as she screams silently while staring at you; and the familiar
face of Warren Garner, eyes glowing red as he smirks in smug superiority, a blue
eyeband visible on his forehead just below his horns. Beneath the holograms is
the repeated message: TAKE A FOURTH OPTION FOR A REAL ACE PRESIDENT: VOTE ATHER

natural and obvious superiority of the AEU, when he doesn't simply dismiss your
existence due to your clear inferiority.  His blue dress uniform is exemplary, a
shoulder patch showing him to be part of the Militarized Expeditionary Force. 
Several medals for long service and dedication to the AEU cover his chest,
including one for 'exploratory ability far superior to that of the incompetent
civilian pilots'.  An impressively thin handlebar moustache rests above his top
lip, carefully waxed to keep it from drooping after constant manipulation. He is

had that many legs, or human ears growing upon their backs. There is also a
dimly-lit back room here.

Professor Bugley seems to definitely be venturing into genetic engineering,
known in the vernacular as simply gengineering. One of his ongoing projects
appears to be research into a fruit not unlike an apple, which will grow
naturally in dark and damp places much like mold. Very appropriate for a
renewable source of fruit aboard an old creaking space station! Unfortunately,
the project may not be going so well, as the fruits so far produced seem to have
a tendency to squish easily and... well, bleed.
