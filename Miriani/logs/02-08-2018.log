00:55 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the one-person fighter "This Is A Fighter" powered down here.
You see the five-person transverser "Ikezuki", the one-person fighter "One Man Outfit", the ten-person battlecruiser "Intergalactic Battle Taxi", the one-person cargo hauler "Salviger", the three-person heliogaster "River of Time", and the one-person expediter "Flying Cat" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Cally the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, and Mell the droid here.
You can go north, southeast, and southwest.

Bathed in bright white lights, this enormous chamber houses the High Guard rearm facility. Most of the facility is cordoned off by warning tape that states only authorized personelle are allowed further into the complex. High on the ceiling are a series of tracks that drones zip to and fro on going up to the garage level and back, delivering bardenium to ships as well as toting bardenium storage boxes. A surly-looking droid in High Guard uniform patrols the shop, clipboard in robotic hands and asks patrons what they need. When it gets all the necessary information, it makes a note on its clipboard and sends a team of drones out. A menu terminal near the doorway displays bardenium costs as well as an interface for people to order their own rearmaments and storage boxes. A tall stone archway in the east wall leads to a proximity weapon store, and two human High Guard officers stand watch to either side of it, hands resting on holstered stun weapons.

01:18 ["Canavara" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

01:18 ["Canavara" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

01:19 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:19 You sit down on a black leather crewman chair.

01:19 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Oh, not that kind of short."

01:19 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:20 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:20 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:20 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:20 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "sneaky!"

01:20 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:20 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:20 A loud rendition of Jingle Bells sounds as orange lights twinkle overhead.

01:20 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:20 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:20 [General Communication] David Arther transmits, "To late."

01:20 Nonconsenting players are currently aboard. Out of character communication is not permitted.

01:20 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:20 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:20 The cannons are already loaded.

01:20 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:20 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:57 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the one-person fighter "This Is A Fighter" powered down here.
You see the five-person transverser "Ikezuki", the one-person fighter "One Man Outfit", the ten-person battlecruiser "Intergalactic Battle Taxi", the one-person expediter "Flying Cat", the six-person destroyer "Canavara", and the three-person heliogaster "Echoes From The Underground" landed here.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

07:07 ["Intergalactic Battle Taxi" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a tapestry depicting an orange dog lying on the sofa with a bone hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is closed. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Iclea; Landing Pad.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south.

19:54 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

19:54 The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."

19:54 #$#soundpack_lag 233

19:54 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

19:54 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

19:54 [General Communication] Justin Stroup transmits, "Bay soon."

19:54 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

19:54 The ship is already moving.

19:54 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

19:54 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

19:54 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

19:54 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

19:54 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

19:54 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 9, 8."

19:54 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

19:54 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

19:54 [General Communication] Scarlett Recelli transmits, "Just give a holler."

19:54 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

19:54 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

19:54 Would you like to request landing clearance at Rolukssica?
[Enter "yes" or "no"]

19:54 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

19:54 [1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

19:54 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

19:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

19:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.
You need to stand up first.

19:54 You can't go that way.

19:54 You need to stand up first.

19:54 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

19:54 You stand up.

19:54 You lift a small panel and crawl through the resulting opening, emerging in the starship's network of ducts. Being the gentlemen that you are, you replace the panel behind you.

19:54 #$#soundpack environment starship space | powered | safe | light | indoors
["Sea Turtle" Duct] (indoors)
You can go south and out.

19:54 You lift a small panel and crawl through.

["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south.

19:54 [General Communication] Bob Jones transmits, "On my way."

19:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

19:54 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

19:54 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

19:54 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

19:54 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

19:55 You remove a droid remote titled "rolukssica" from a sleek black leather carrying case.

19:55 For a top, you are wearing a navy blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of faded blue jeans with metal studs around the back pockets over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, a red spacesuit navigational computer, a red leather artifact storage container, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, and a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

Towering trees dot the area, their branches hanging low with reddish gold apples. To the north, a narrow break in the trees leads off to a shaded path. To the south, a wide trail indicates a primitive road. The only other sign of modernization is the tall tower of rock rising into the sky off to the east. An open archway leads into the structure.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south.

20:32 You're already sitting down.

20:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:42 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and an asteroid have been detected in the sector."

20:42 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

20:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:42 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:42 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:42 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

20:42 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Desolo.

20:42 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:43 Would you like to request landing clearance at Desolo?

20:43 [Enter "yes" or "no"]
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:43 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

20:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

21:19 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Desolo Island; Sandy Clearing.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.

21:53 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:53 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

21:53 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:53 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:53 You're already sitting down.

21:53 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:53 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:53 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

21:53 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:53 The ten-person battlecruiser "Fractious Malcontent" has left the sector.

21:53 There are no ships here.

21:53 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

21:53 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:53 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:53 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:14 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.
You see the eight-person gunship "Elemental's Vengeance" landed here.
