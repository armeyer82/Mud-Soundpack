The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.

The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.
03:26  You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and an orange and white cat here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

06:24 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

06:24 A clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener freshens the room with the scent of Desolian Sunshine.

07:23 You hear the distinct hiss of water being pumped through the ship's piping. Moments later, a flurry of frozen water crystals begins to drift down from vents in the ceiling, lazily swirling through currents of air being pumped out until it settles on the deck plating, where it immediately melts into a hazardous water puddle.

The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

18:53 [Newbie] Will Carter: If it's what I think it is, the salvage sensor will let you spam the SAL command more before it complains. So you can be flying and type SAL SAL SAL SAL to have four chances of picking up a piece of debris rather than being limited to SAL SAL and only having two chances. And the debris scanner will let you SCAN a piece of debris to tell what type it is.

19:56 #$#soundpack_pong

19:56 #$#soundpack_lag 110

19:56 [Newbie] Cara West: The charge is just how many shots they can fire either stun or healing before they can't. So you can fire 100 shots per drone before you have to top them up fully again.

19:56 [Newbie] Ivan Cardenas: So, one ammo mag equals 100 shots?

20:00 #$#soundpack_pong

20:00 #$#soundpack_lag 116

20:00 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: Number of charges per mag equals number of charges you would normally get. E.G, high capacity is 24, normal is 12, but photobalistic is also 12.

20:00 [Newbie] Michael Calaway: Aha, there we go, thanks for that!

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an inte

You see Katrianne Beauchene (dozing) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

20:14 You lean in toward Katrianne Beauchene and gently kiss her lips.

20:15 The computer announces, "The destination Sector 19: Venitia is 8533.0 lightyears east, 8714.0 lightyears south, and 7545.0 lightyears down."

20:15 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:15 Katrianne Beauchene inputs some coordinates into a navigational control console.

20:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 20, 20, 20.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras
20:56 h bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.

Tradesman Certificates
--------------------------------------------------
Tradesman item certificates are a method for a donator to redeem a request to use at a later date. Such requests are placed into a secondary queue, and do not take priority over items requested on Empanda Station. They can also be gifted to other players if you're feeling generous enough! It doesn't matter if the recipient of the gift is a donator or not. It may also be worth noting that the exchange and use of tradesman certificates is out of character, thus you can use and obtain them anywhere in the game except for locations that reside out of communications range (but can't talk about them via IC communication).
Furthermore, tradesman certificates may only be submitted once every two weeks. If you submit a tradesman item certificate and it is completed a day later, you may not submit another one for up to two weeks after that time. Rejections do not incur a waiting period.
 
Commands:
  @CGIVE <person>
Give <person> a tradesman certificate. Once you have selected a player to gift, you will be prompted for the amount of tradesman certificates you wish to transfer. You can't give more than you have in your account. Typing the command without arguments will prompt you for a player's name. Once complete, you'll see something like:
        You give 1 tradesman certificate to Mitchell Morganivich Mihola.
The recipient will see:
        Mitchell
21:05  Morganivich Mihola has just given you 1 tradesman certificate.
 
  @CREQUEST
Request an item using one of your available certificates. You will be presented with a menu, similar to the one that appears in the Empanda Station tradesman concourse. You must have at least one tradesman certificate to utilize this command. For sake of immersion, this command cannot be utilized while out of communications range. Complete all tradesman requests prior to leaving local space.
 
  @REQUEST-CERT
Redeem a certificate. You will be prompted to confirm the request, and once complete, a tradesman item certificate will be added to your account.
 
  @CERT-MARKET
Enter the tradesman item certificate marketplace. You can sell or buy tradesman certificates here for credits. The command may be shortened down to @CM for brevity. Be warned that trades are not audited by the Toastsoft hosts. Confirm at your own risk!
You may also type @CM [on | off] to connect or disconnect from the tradesman market channel. Notifications of new and completed sales are announced here.
 
  REQUESTCHECK
See if you're eligible to request a donator item. Note: similarly to the commands above, this command is out of character.
 
Notes:
* Tradesman certificates are attached to your account, not your character. This means they stay with you through rerolls.
* If your request is rejected, you will receive a tradesman certificate redemption token in the mail.
