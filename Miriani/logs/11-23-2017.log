["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer.

Room Poses
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  ROOM-POSE [pose | clear | off | <player name> | <object name>]

Description:
  Room poses allow you to include custom text after your name, or an object's name, in a room's description. Ideally, this would be text indicating your default position in the room. You might be leaning against your starship, curled up in a ball in the corner, idly twirling your hair, splayed out in a chair, etc. They should not show continuous action, like spitting on the ground, doing pushups, running around in circles, etc.

  Room poses can contain object names and, for convenience, the game will automatically match to objects in the room if you use a dash in front of a partial name. For example, if you want to indicate that you're standing with one foot atop a large book in the room called 'a tome of lore and longwindedness', you wouldn't need to type out the entire name of the book. Instead, you can simply type: -tome

  We ask that players be mature and courteous with the use of this command. Anybody walking in off the street will see this text, so please keep it tasteful. You should absolutely avoid and, if seen, REPORT any offensive room poses or people abusing it to mislead other into believing that another player (or even the player themself) is doing something that they cannot or should not be doing. If you find that somebody is matching your name in the room in a way you believe to be inappropriate, you can dissolve their room pose by typing RPOSE <player's name>.

  The ROOM-POSE command with no arguments will display your last five room poses for convenient recall if you should move to another room. 

  The PEOPLE command can be used to see how your pose will appear to other players. To do this, you need to supply an argument to the command. For example: PEOPLE ME

  The ROOM-POSE command can also be piped through the E2 command, allowing you to announce to the room at the same time as you change your pose. The syntax for that can be slightly complicated, so here is an example demonstrating how to show the room that you're leaning against a wall: E2 leans against the wall. | rpose leaning against the wall

  You can also use room poses on objects. The same restrictions apply to objects that apply to your own room pose. Additionally, objects with room poses must be bolted down. In order to apply a room pose to an object, you must have the same permissions that are required to bolt objects down. Generally, this means that you must own the room in which you're posing the object in or otherwise be authorized to control the room. The syntax for this is: ROOM-POSE <object name>. You will then be prompted for a pose. To close an existing pose, hit enter at the prompt.

Restrictions:
  * If you have something after your name in parenthesis, your pose will not appear. Th
03:27 is prevents overriding pre-programmed systems with custom text.
  * Your pose will clear every time you enter a new room. However, the ROOM-POSE command maintains a memory of your last five poses.
  * You can't use another player's name after a comma or the word AND to prevent tricking people into thinking they're doing something that they aren't.
  * At present, you're limited to 100 character poses.
  * Poses cannot contain parenthesis.
  * If you're found to be abusing the command, you will have your ability to use it revoked.

Example:
  ROOM-POSE leaning against the wall
  ROOM-POSE standing with one leg atop -tome

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background.

10:58 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) (hostile environment)
You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a white wicker wardrobe, a fuzzy suitcase, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a pink suitcase, and a pair of white platform sandals here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) here.
You can go south.

10:58 You lean in toward Kitty Mars and gently kiss her lips.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa cover
