-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top,
Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated
green cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a red plastic food storage
container, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Sassie the large fuchsia felo
here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

[Starship "Smashing Your Dreams"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The two-person light transport "Flight Of The Eagle", the A.S.S. tactical
platform "Yadira Rivera", the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

Sakura Arakida
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. She has
narrow shoulders and somewhat small breasts. Her face is heart-shaped and
girlish, with a delicate nose and sharp chin. Her lips are lovely and rosebud
pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of
expressive eyebrows, her eyes are pale blue and round. Her shoulder-length, wavy
hair is blue-black and hanging in a single braid. She has oval painted
iridescent mystic purple fingernails. She has a sprinkling of glittering garnets
in her hair.
 She is wearing a charcoal gray canvas jacket, a violet blossom v-neck cotton
tee, a pair of slim black jeans, and a pair of sleek black suede shoes with
taupe laces. She is also wearing a dark metallic pink touch einrophone in a dark
gray leather phone holster, a shimmering pink and gold cherry blossom keychain,
a compact metallic saffron camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the front
with a glittery cobalt blue camera strap, and a long red leather whip. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire

Sakura so if Sakura wasn't going to be available, she could have contacted thos

so difficult about that?"

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.

With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a
battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Akrep"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.
You see a large leather chair here.
You can go north and south.
(You are sitting on a large leather chair.)
You hear the sudden metallic complaints of the hull as a minicannon hit leaves
several hull plates glowing white hot.
The computer announces, "This ship has been hit by Outsider starship 'Heavy
Assault Kappa Zzormyu.' Critical hit!"
The hull creaks with too-rapid temperature changes as laser fire plays upon it.

[Starship "Akrep"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Akrep"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Akrep"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
