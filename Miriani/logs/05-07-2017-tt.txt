She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches
tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips
and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than
average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and
understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally
part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows,
her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight
hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a
small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a tight black t-shirt with a bright purple dragon
embroidered on the front, a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans, and
a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate
ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a
soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named
Asteria. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms,
both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.

hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate
ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an

bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of
the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare
and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical
representation of the ship and its components, alongside current
estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect
when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick
bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of
the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare
and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical
representation of the ship and its components, alongside current
estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a
wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a
distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board
allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches
tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips
and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than
average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and
understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally
part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows,
her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight
hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a

 She is wearing a tight black t-shirt with a bright purple dragon
embroidered on the front, a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans, and

white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate
ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits
protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of
the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a
view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing
essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a
working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though
the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire
architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.
