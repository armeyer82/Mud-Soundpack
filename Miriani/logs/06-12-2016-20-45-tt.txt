Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping,
curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire
front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A
large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation
mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide
a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck
behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every
surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch, a black leather sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream
leather interior, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, an
elegant crystal decanter, a small black cooler, a bottle of peach schnapps, a
bottle of expensive cognac, a white time meter, a cream plastic box labeled
'Space Imager Photos', Kosmo the humanoid service robot, and a space imaging
photograph of a large gas giant orbiting close to a star here.

and you're going to be the ritchest, newest pilot."

we've traveled almost 2 ltcs, that's where I got the roughly 28 from."

last buyable crafting lisence that I want when we get home."
Zandria Marschaund nods to Nathaniel Owens.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well you guys will certainl realize some
good money. When you achieve the necessary points, planets themselves pay 250
mil."
Zandria says to Sakura, "Tht was my thought too, electronics at least, then
starship synthesis will be my last."
Morris Corlew exclaims in an Old Earth accent, "Whoa, nice!"
Zandria Marschaund smiles.
Nathaniel Owens says in a Candelarian accent, "Well, when I get home, I'm gonna
go looking to buy more arti detecters and get out there some more to get
artifacts. Also, I'm going to upgrade all my salvaging equipment and do
salvaging, do some combat rilated stuff, get points for stuff like teh rift
drive. That's my few months planned out."
Nathaniel Owens says in a Candelarian accent, "Oh, and GMG. Don't forget GMG."

Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the southeast.
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "This is the first time I've ever
done anything exploration related. Of course, we left when I'd been a pilot for
barely two weeks and had just graduated a few days before. I guess jumping in
feet first is a good way to do it sometimes."
Nathaniel Owens says in a Candelarian accent, "My first time in the rift I did
something so stupid I just couldn't believe how idiotic I was."
Akemi says to Morris, "I'd been a full pilot for three weeks or so before I went
on my first trip, but it was a pretty good one."
Nathaniel Owens says in a Candelarian accent, "Basicly, I was using an inserter,
needed some charge, so what did I do. Killed navigational systems."
Zandria Marschaund says in an Old Earth accent, "Blah."
Morris says to Nathaniel, "Yikes."
Akemi says to Nathaniel, "So, did someone come pick you up?"
Nathaniel Owens nods.
Nathaniel Owens says in a Candelarian accent, "I wasn't out of comms thank god."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I don't think we have inserters pointing
out of comms anymore."
Nathaniel Owens asks in a Candelarian accent, "Isn't the bubble out of comms?"
Lily Kaise shakes her head.
Nathaniel Owens asks in a Candelarian accent, "Why is the bubble even called the
bubble?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Because it has some unique qualities."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "It's a bubble of space where there's no
radio signals."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Whatever civilization lived there, they
somehow blanked out their radio signatures when they vanished."
Lily Kaise nods.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "All that's left are some bits and
pieces. Weird things we pick up and have our scientists look at."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
Nathaniel Owens asks in a Candelarian accent, "Wow? And noone knows yet what it
is? At all?"
Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed felo rubs up against Sassie the large
fuchsia felo, and both animals purr softly.
Lily says to Akemi, "I guess you noticed your co-captain there."

A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other,
then places it back on the conveyor belt.
Lily Kaise points at Xavier the sleeping big silver soldier felo.
Akemi Bando strokes the soft fur of Xavier the sleeping big silver soldier felo.
Xavier the sleeping big silver soldier felo takes a deep breath, then promptly
continues to sleep.
Akemi says to Nathaniel, "There's commonality in some of the things we find
there and in things we find at other sites. Superficially, anyway."
Morris Corlew grins. "Ah...cute."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
southeast.
Akemi says to Nathaniel, "Maybe the people who lived in the Radio Bubble were
very spread out. Whatever happened to them at the Radio Bubble might have just
been part of their decline as an interstellar civilization."
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "Or maybe it was the capper, the last
thing."
Akemi Bando asks in a Japanese accent, "Or it could have been what started their
decline. Who knows?"
Lily Kaise nods.
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "What if it was something intentional
that just survived after they were gone? Maybe they were xenophobic like...well,
like the Outsiders."
Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed felo wanders out.
Lily says to Nathaniel, "Not sure but the artifacts are Alien type which we find
in other areas of shipwrecks farther out."
Nathaniel Owens asks in a Candelarian accent, "Wonder if they're still out there
somewhere, and they left the bubble because humanity expanded to far?"
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I kind of doubt that. We haven't been
around all that long."
Morris Corlew asks in an Old Earth accent, "Do we have any idea how old the
stuff we find is?"
Cindy the old small red sabre-toothed felo wanders in from the airlock.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch
on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
Akemi Bando says in a Japanese accent, "I asked my brother about that once.
Getting accurate ages on objects that have been out in deep space for so long is
one of those things they have trouble with. Cosmic rays irradiate material, and
if we didn't have a good idea of where it came from in the first place then
usual dating techniques just aren't any good."
"That makes sense." Morris Corlew nods. "Even one of our ships that has spent
time in numerous areas of space would be hard to date using the same techniques
we'd have to use with this stuff."
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "Or I mean to say traditional
techniques."
An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a
high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

a dark yellow leather captain's chair with Xavier the sleeping big silver
soldier felo and Sassie the sleeping large fuchsia felo on it
This state of the art starship captain's chair is upholstered in dark yellow
leather and has a polished steel frame. The high back, seat, and armrests are
firmly but deeply padded to mitigate the vibrations, shaking, and sudden changes
of velocity of both normal starship operations and combat. The chair swivels
smoothly from side to side to provide an extended reach of control room
instrument panels.
On top of it you see Xavier the sleeping big silver soldier felo and Sassie the
sleeping large fuchsia felo.
A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small

mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She seems to have a bruise on her forehead. 
 She is wearing a black t-shirt with an image of the Floating Buddha on the
front, a pair of white capri pants, and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a
soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a clear camera with a
saucy strap. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, both hands, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Lily,
Please, I said I was sorry. I waited to see if Kim would volunteer and when she
did, I figured we wouldn’t be able to get the crew together to clear Old
Frontier as we’d have to find someone else to replace her or wait anyways. If
it makes you feel better, then fine, call me selfish. Maybe I am, but I’ve
looked the other way plenty of times when I’ve been left out of beacons or
activities because I had to doze for a few minutes. I didn't know it was going
to be such a big deal. You probably have seen me go on beacons even though I've
done all of mine just to let someone else complete theirs and of course, I would
do the same for you. If a slot had opened up on this beacon, I would have
suggested you immediately. Unfortunately, no slots opened up. If other beacons
are called for while I'm asleep, then go for it.
Guess I'm not as perfect as you so claimed I was last night. I do hope you find
that perfect someone someday, but apparently it's not me.
With a sad and broken heart,
Shule
