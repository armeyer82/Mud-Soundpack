-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;
Docking Bay.
You see a small seashell pink trash can, a small yellow ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl,
a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower
quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and
light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top,
and Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot here.

Dear Mr. Elemmire,
Recently, you applied to the Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special
Licenses seeking permission to purchase and operate a H-07b Hermes
Communications Two Passenger Luxury Long-Range Sightseer. Your application was
analyzed by our finest psychologists, and we also reviewed all records of your
service as a pilot.
Unfortunately, at the conclusion of this process, we reached the decision that
we could not accept your application at this time.
You are welcome to re-apply at the beginning of the next six week civilian
liaison term. If you choose to do so, we will take your new application
responses into account along with any new additions to your pilot record that
have occurred in the intervening time.
Until then, please accept our condolences and find enclosed one coupon for a
free small Rickety Rick's Spacey Cheesey Fries.
Sincerely,
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses

You say, "Yeah, probably, but I don't know how else to respond."

for an Expedition, what would you consider to be a good make up?"
Samantha the large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

resoolution on the trips I've been on.

You say, "It seemed like the decisions went through the expedition leader first
and if the ship owner disagreed, then we discussed it."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "So let's see. If we were to discover a
space space station or one of those Ginships. Who would be most appropriate to
initiate the contact with them and other aspects? I mean doesn't prior
experience play into the make up of crew?"
Samantha the large violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the airlock.
nod 'That's why I said smoe people who are comfortable navigating and being in
the rift as those people tend to also have experience with exploration.

'er, some people
You say, "Er, some people."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the south.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I disagree as it generally has
been. For this past expedition, it was between Akemi and Kim but I've seen
Melinda play a big role. I've also been called in with Melinda and Reets on
occasion and others have. So I would suggest that that aspect is one which is
important for 10 or more pilots who are cooped up together for a week or more."
Lily Kaise grins.
'But I've never seen that.
You say, "But I've never seen that."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah but it's not just 'exploration'"

a plastic frond of light green sea fern.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Wouldn't you think that good negotiation
skills for negotiating trade is helpful?"
nod 'But the question was what you felt was necessary. Not what you felt was
helpful.
"But the question was what you felt was necessary." You nod. "Not what you felt
was helpful."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well I'd likely say it's a necessary
aspect of a good crew on an Expedition."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So you just can't lob everything into
the term 'Exploration'."
'Well, on  the last expedition we went on, we didn't do any trading. We might
have done it, but we didn't.

Akemi's ship right?"
nod
You nod.
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a
red glowing interior pulsates gently.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "So those might have been used for
negotiations for trade for who knows as well as crafted items and otherwise."
'I just interpreted the question as what are the absolute necessary roles. Not
what would be helpful roles.
You say, "I just interpreted the question as what are the absolute necessary
roles. Not what would be helpful roles."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well so far, I'm not saying tht what I'm
stating are just 'helpful' though I'd personally consider them necessary."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the south.
nod 'Maybe, but by that reasoning, you and I should never head off on a random
expedition to who knows where. Unless between the two of us, we can fulfill of
of those roles.

"I'm just saying what I think." You smile at Lily Kaise. "I understand your
point of view though."
Sassie the large fuchsia felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No but that was a hypothetical question
and they certainly want you to consider how 10 or more pilots who are all
generally Type A personalities are all going to fit into a small environment as
well as how the crew would deal with not only the spaects of navigation but
obviously, since exploraiton involves discovery, how those discoveries are dealt
with and so on."
Lily Kaise grins.

Exploration Ships:
Two-Person Scout 3,750,000.00 (bikura)
AY-71 AEU LONG-RANGE SCOUT
Class: Scout
Requirements: 10 industry points        0 combat points
Model number: AY-71                     Designation: Scout
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 8000         Standard battery hours: 18
Docking bay size required: 12.5
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
The two-person exploration scout is the AEU pilot's usual choice for
exploration. Outfitted with the right battery, it can go for a very long time.
It is also small, comfortable and reasonably well armed so it can hold its own
against a minor enemy force. Some of the later and larger ships will be able to
hold more charge, but the scout seems to be many a pilot's choice regardless.
If a pilot has the right amount of points (100 industry, 100 space combat and 10
exploration), they can upgrade their exploration scout now into an advanced
scout at a shop named Emerging Technologies on New Earth. This advanced scout is
still an exploration vessel, but more heavily armed than the initial design.
However, you also lose a significant portion of your battery charge when
upgrading to this level of scout.
Two-Person Void Piercer 660,000,000.00 (endymion Revo Technologies)
RDT-E1M9S REVO DEVELOPMENTAL TECHNOLOGIES VOID PIERCER
Class: Scout
Requirements: 1000 industry points      1250 exploration points
Model number: RDT-E1M9S                 Designation: Void Piercer
Turret hardpoints: 0                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 12000        Standard battery hours: 24
Docking bay size required: 12.5
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 110%
The Void Piercer has six hours more than the exploration scout in standard
charge, and seems to go slightly faster. Aside from that though, it seems to for
the most part be unremarkable from the exploration scout. The expensiveness is
due to the cost of needing to re-research the information which led to the
ship's construction since the original prototype was stolen.
One-Person Vostok 250,000,000.00 (Farport the Black room)
ME-3Q/X-42 EAOS-MUTUALITY-TANDEM VOSTOK-CLASS EXPERIMENTAL RIFT CAPSULE
Class: Capsule
Requirements: 1500 industry points      0 combat points
Model number: ME-3Q/X-42                Designation: Vostok
Turret hardpoints: 1                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 0            Standard battery hours: 48
Docking bay size required: 2.5
Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 150%               Max Cruising Speed: 150%
This ship is capable of going far deeper into the rift than any other ship. As a
result, it moves ssignificantly faster than any other vessel currently available
that is equipped with a rift drive, and comes with one already installed.
Furthermore, this ship is not very good at locating points of interest until it
is practically on top of them, though some tests have shown that if you decrease
your speed, you're able to detect things from farther out. You cannot do any
manual moving in this ship, and you cannot leave it in hostile environments
since it does not have an airlock.
Two-Person Arrow (approval required) (Aenea)
AY-72 AEU ARROW-CLASS EXTREME-RANGE SCOUT
Class: Scout (Limited Alliance Support)
Requirements: 3500 industry points      1500 exploration points
Model number: AY-72                     Designation: Arrow
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 12000        Standard battery hours: 36
Docking bay size required: 12.5
   Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 110%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 110%
This is a prewar alliance exploration vessel, and is virtually unremarkable from
other exploration vessels except for a few things. The biggest thing is that it
has a subwarp drive. This subwarp drive basically creates a mini wormhole which
can get you from one part of the sector to any coordinates within the sector you
designate. So, if you want to get to a station which is located at 5, 4, 2 you
would set the subwarp drive on a set of coordinates that is one unit away from
the station. For example, 6, 4, 2 or 4, 4, 2 etc. In addition to the subwarp
drive, the arrow also has a very nice battery on it which with present upgrades,
can make the ship have a good, three solid days of charge if you play your cards
right. However, you will have to fill out an application if you ever want to own
one, and approval or denial notifications can take a while to get to you. You
will be notified by mail one way or the other.
Five-Person Magnetar (Explorer Corps only) (Aenea)
AY-9X AEU MAGNETAR-CLASS EXPLORATION VESSEL
Class: Gunship (Limited Alliance Support)
Requirements: 5000 industry points      2500 exploration points
Model number: AY-9X                     Designation: Magnetar
Turret hardpoints: 9                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 32000        Standard battery hours: 38
Docking bay size required: 60           Docking bay capacity: 25
Class Modifications:
Instantaneous Speed: 95%
Little is known about this ship, as only members of the explorer corps can get
one, and no one I presently know of is a member of the explorer corps. So, until
we can get further details about the vessel from someone in the explorer corps,
please refer to the information about it written above.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a clear plastic food storage
container, a small white trash bin, a red plastic food storage container, Purr
the humanoid service robot, and Desiree the little black and white spotted
CatBot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "South Americans first made a
kind of frothy chocolate drink from cacao. It was somewhat bitter because the
cacao wasn't treated the way it is for candy, so they would put spices in it
too. Later, when it was introduced to Europe, it was sweetened and over time
techniques were developed to turn it into the milk chocolate and dark chocolates
we all enjoy now."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Woo Akemi...and Chocolate!"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Nowadays they can synthesize
everything important to the chocolate flavor, and more cheaply than all the work
that goes into growing and harvesting and processing the beans."

genuine chocolate sold too, made more or less the same way it has been for four
hundred years now."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah...I doubt there's much
cocao in the grapeshot."

us."

though."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wow...nice. Might find a new place to
haul from then."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Do we have any right now?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "We're on the salvage station, and the GMG
ones."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Hang on. I can tell you exactly which, oh
and the BAS. I built that one personally."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "But not the roid stations?
Ok...well...guess I can contribute to...whoever."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Which one is the BAS?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "The one we submit to when we do beacons.
West of the torus."

[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thanks. Sorry...had an anchor and line
giving me issues."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well...if I get done what I want to get
done, I might be able to help with it. I'm getting kinda close to that goal.
We'll see though."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Hmm. Not many stations. We need to fix
this."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "So who got in on these stations?
Guessing Cats and maybe Stability?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Salvage processors in 465 and 134. As
well as the one out at the belt of orion, and the weather station, the recharger
Klaus and I put up out at the bubble... And the op station out at 465. And a
rift accelerator for 134 so we're on that, but not the toll tracker. what the
hell? Oh and the BAS. Mostly kings and cats are on most of these."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "People annoy me."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Kings is Cesar right?"
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Yep."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wonder who did it...since he was with
me. Don't know how big they are."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "Time to go artifacting."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Have fun."
[Starseekers] Angel Martin transmits, "We put a broadcaster in that recharger
station, so I'll still be able to talk."
[Starseekers] Morris Corlew transmits, "Awesomeness."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I am so going to have to go
work out after this. Setting up anchors does not burn the calories that these
grapeshots have in them."
[General Communication] Angel Martin giggles.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Is there anything other than having a
partner that affects roundtime on anchors and lines when hauling roids? Seems
like it's longer this morning than it usually is when I'm solo."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I think it's random."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "It's just random. Sometimes you'll work
fast, sometimes it'll take you a minute."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Have you seen the
battlefields?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No...there's one where there's
a volcano...and screaming people...and skeletons...and shit like that."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "A black. I just need one
more, just one."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "How much would you pay for it?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well, the one I got on the
market was 70 mill, so, I dunno."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The flying island one is pretty
neat."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah I like that one. And the
alien landscape."

that. That's a good deal."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I never have my ticket for
that blasted conductor though."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah like, it was 70
something. I grabbed at it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh hell...4 points for all
that roid haulin?"
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Wish I'd have seen it. I needed
a black eggie. Well, what's your max you're willing to pay? I'll sell you this
one."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It pays to salvage I have
found. Gets ya way more."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The courier got me a hell of a
lot more than those roids."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Which reminds me...I am not
too thrilled with them. Some performance review that was."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Angel let me know what you'd
consider, and I'll see what I can come up with."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I wasn't going to charge more
than 150."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I may have to let you keep
him. I don't think I can go that high without not eating for a month."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

[General Communication] Melissa Cantrelle transmits, "I don't care. I've been
called far worse than either."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Woman demands respect, lady
implies class."

trying to teach Morris is, there is a difference."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Consider me tutored."
[General Communication] Angel Martin snickers.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Class is boring, so I'll
pick woman."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Much better than being called a
bitch, slut, whore or cunt. I hate all of those words, by the way."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Personally, I'm used to
being called a chick, though I'd lean toward woman otherwise."
[General Communication] Melissa Cantrelle transmits, "I've been called all of
those words, by the way."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "The other words I don't
like but if you call me a bitch, I'll probably just go wuff."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is no pilot I would call
one of those. Maybe an ex-cadet, but...that's an old story."
[General Communication] Paige McCormick transmits, "All of what words?"
[General Communication] Angel Martin giggles at Melinda Michaels.
[General Communication] Melissa Cantrelle transmits, "Actually, I've been called
all of those within the same breath."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "See? They both prefer
woman...which is what I called them."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "A... bitch slut whore cunt?"
[General Communication] Paige McCormick transmits, "Oh dear."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I use those words
constantly, they really don't bother me. I have a horrible, horrible mouth, but
that's just how it is."
[General Communication] Melissa Cantrelle transmits, "No. Just like, by the same
person, with other words."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Oh, dear."
[General Communication] Melissa Cantrelle transmits, "Usually fuck and off were
in there as well."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Poty mouth. Clean it out with
soap."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Clean that dirty mouth of
yours."

me a lot. Though I barely said hell around her, let alone anything worse than
that."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hell no. This way is much

Names don't bother me."

Melinda...and I've been on comms almost constantly for like...36 hours nearly."

so himself."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Nobody listens to Cesar."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh I'm doomed then."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Nor do we agree with him
half the time."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I wouldn't have called him
that, besides, cesar's... well, cesar."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Na, he just got wound up
over things easily and you had to work in order to get him settled down. When I
say work, I mean work real hard. But, he was smart, a good pilot and probably
one of the most helpful people I've met. Sometimes overly helpful."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Many of those are very good
qualities."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I am so jealous of Melinda
right now."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Why?"

you know."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh, um, well, thank you.
Now, what do you want?"

heartbroken."
[General Communication] Angel Martin laughs.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's easier to tell when
you're in the same room and she's trying to steal your kitten."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Make sure you tell her it's
nothing personal."
[General Communication] Angel Martin snickers.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I will do that."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "She's cute."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;
Docking Bay.
You see a small seashell pink trash can, a small yellow ball containing a

replicate an inconsistency, sure. For a multi-room enemy ship, evading one lock
is worth one evasion and further locks from the same ship at the same time are

each weapon room counted towards 1 evasion. Thanks much!"

same ship that's 1.2 evasions?"
[Newbie Help] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Hooray math."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes, thanks. I wondered how that
worked out."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a clear plastic food storage
container, a small white trash bin, a red plastic food storage container, Purr

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
