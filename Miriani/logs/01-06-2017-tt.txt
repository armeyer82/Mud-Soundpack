Star Conquest Help: Decoy Beacons
--
Category: Activities
--
Decoy beacons are objects launched from a starship that tend to attract other
ships in the area. Often, these are ships hostile to humanity. Redirecting these
patrols and destroying them is helpful to humanity's war effort.
Decoy beacons and their launcher can be purchased at Accord of Free Worlds
Command.
Once you have purchased a launcher, it must be bolted in a ship's control room.
Decoy beacons can then be loaded into it.
Next, you must move into uncharted space. This means you simply move off of the
edge of any charted sector.
Once you are in uncharted space, type BEACON to launch your decoy beacon. You
may choose a signal strength for your beacon, which will directly affect the
level of response. (OOCly, these are difficulty levels.) The higher strengths
are NOT recommended unless you have a veteran crew.
Enemies typically take 2-3 minutes to respond, and will then respond with a
force proportionate to the strength and number of ships in the sector.
More friendly ships entering the sector will cause the enemy to call for
reinforcements.
The decoy beacon drop is successful when all enemy ships are destroyed, but be
warned! Launching the decoy beacon in a sector with RATS or other unfriendlies
will negate payout.
A beacon drop of higher difficulty will earn greater rewards. However, if your
ship leaves for repairs in the middle of a more difficult beacon drop, its
reward will be downgraded to that of a standard beacon drop. For the best
reward, stick to a difficulty level you can handle, and stay and fight!
Enemies can only be fooled in this way so many times before they cease
responding.
OOC: In other words, you are able to do beacon drops eight times per Conquest
period. You can check this with the INFO command.
