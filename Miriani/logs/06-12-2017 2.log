00:02:26 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

00:07:48 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

00:09:32 Emily Ford slinks in from the south.

00:09:32 Emily Ford slinks west.

00:09:37 Emily Ford slinks in from the west.

00:09:44 Emily Ford slinks south.

00:10:19 Eli Grey roams in from the south.

00:13:42 Eli Grey says, "Hmm."

00:13:44 Eli Grey roams south.

00:13:56 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

00:14:06 Aisling the Fox carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Thor from her shoulder.

00:14:09 Aisling the Fox puts down a Tardick lizard named Thor.

00:14:15 Aisling says to a Tardick lizard named Thor, "Have good sleep."

00:16:42 Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

00:16:45 Rogue Romano slinks east.

00:17:43 Rogue Romano slinks in from the east.

00:17:50 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

00:18:13 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

00:18:19 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:18:20 Lily Kaise glides south.

00:18:36 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "99 percent!"

00:18:51 Rogue Romano says into the PA microphone, "Nice."

00:19:03 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

00:19:18 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tail.

00:19:41 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Damage to the blast chamber is 36.62."

00:19:44 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sorry!"

00:20:04 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

00:20:14 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:20:24 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So yeah, you're probably right Vernos."

00:20:24 Morris Corlew laughs. "Lily."

00:20:26 Morris Corlew picks up a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper.

00:20:28 Morris Corlew crumples up his stained crinkled sandwich wrapper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

00:20:52 The blast chamber shuts down, having fully charged the starship.

00:21:09 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All charged!"

00:21:16 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

00:21:20 Vernos Bailey sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

00:21:48 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Damage is 36.86."

00:21:57 Eli Grey dashes in from the south.

00:22:22 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

00:22:24 Morris Corlew sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

00:22:35 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:22:51 Eli Grey says to Rogue Romano, "Oh.. where did you find vodka?"

00:22:53 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

00:22:59 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:23:03 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:23:03 Lily Kaise glides south.

00:23:22 Damien Goss points east.

00:23:26 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

00:23:29 Rogue Romano says, "The beverage thing in the galley."

00:23:29 Lily Kaise glides east.

00:23:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec asks, "So, battery is full?"

00:23:47 Eli Grey says, "Wow, no shit. Can't believe I missed that."

00:23:47 Damien Goss nods.

00:23:49 Eli Grey nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

00:23:54 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We should probably leave, then."

00:23:55 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

00:24:00 Lily Kaise gives a shot of chilled vodka to Eli Grey.

00:24:00 Rogue Romano says, "I'm jonesin' for a smoke. So I have drink instead."

00:24:07 Eli Grey says, "Nissi's up there."

00:24:13 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:24:20 Eli Grey asks, "She was setting the heading and stuff.. I'm guessing she'll take off soon?"

00:24:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Okay."

00:24:32 Morris Corlew nods.

00:24:35 Eli says to Rogue, "No doubt, I could use a cigarette or a pipe right about now."

00:24:39 Eli says to Lily Kaise, "Thank you."

00:24:42 Eli Grey takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

00:24:47 Lily Kaise says, "Sure it's in the beverage machine."

00:24:59 Damien Goss says, "There is a blender around here somewhere too."

00:25:04 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:25:05 Lily Kaise glides east.

00:25:08 Eli Grey nods.

00:25:57 Eli Grey says, "Hmm.. I wonder how much charge a filtration system woudl use up."

00:26:06 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

00:26:11 Eli Grey says, "They have a really nice one over on.. um.. foxtrot, yeah that's the place."

00:26:20 Morris says to Eli, "Could go outside and have a smoke in your suit? Wait...never mind."

00:26:22 Lily Kaise removes a compact purple blender from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

00:26:26 Lily Kaise pats a compact purple blender lightly.

00:26:27 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

00:26:34 Lily Kaise says, "I'll put that in the galley."

00:26:43 Lily Kaise exclaims, "On the bar!"

00:26:43 Morris Corlew says, "There's one in there."

00:26:45 Eli Grey says, "It's wall to wall folks smoking in there, so it must work pretty good."

00:26:47 Morris Corlew stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

00:26:49 Morris Corlew lopes east.

00:26:50 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't see it."

00:26:52 Lily Kaise glides east.

00:27:05 Morris Corlew lopes in from the east.

00:27:05 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heh there it is."

00:27:08 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

00:27:08 Rogue Romano says, "Open them eyes a bit wider."

00:27:13 Lily Kaise puts a compact purple blender in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

00:27:14 Morris Corlew sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

00:27:20 Vernos Bailey presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

00:27:22 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:27:34 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

00:28:12 Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

00:28:15 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

00:28:16 Rogue Romano slinks south.

00:29:00 You hear a solid thunk sound as a cloud of nebular dust is expelled from the storage room.

00:29:01 You hear a solid thunk sound as some interstellar dust is expelled from the storage room.

00:29:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:29:37 Vernos Bailey says nothing.

00:29:48 A Tardick lizard named Thor's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

00:29:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:30:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Must be filling up the hold."

00:30:28 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

00:30:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Replace the dust with hydrogen, I guess."

00:30:57 Morris Corlew nods.

00:31:11 Eli Grey takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

00:31:16 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

00:31:18 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly south.

00:31:19 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:31:24 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

00:31:27 Aisling the Fox says, "And we are off."

00:31:29 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:31:29 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:31:31 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

00:31:32 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

00:31:35 Vernos Bailey says, "Woo."

00:31:36 Rogue Romano nods.

00:31:39 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

00:31:42 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

00:31:49 The starship has left a unique area of space.

00:39:39 Nissi Valdaire says, "Okay so maybe telling smokers to airlock themselves was excessive! Sorry. But my point was I'd rather people didn't."

00:39:48 Morris Corlew laughs at Nissi Valdaire.

00:39:55 Morris says to Nissi, "When did you do this?"

00:40:01 Nissi Valdaire says, "A few minutes ago."

00:40:07 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

00:40:08 Morris Corlew grins.

00:40:18 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe Ather will make his bolt available for it."

00:40:29 Nissi Valdaire says, "That's really the only way it'd work."

00:40:34 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

00:40:51 Morris says to Nissi, "Well, don't get down on yourself. I said go outside and smoke in your suit..."

00:40:58 Nissi Valdaire grins.

00:41:11 Morris Corlew says, "Potentially just as bad."

00:42:13 Rogue Romano says, "No no, its all good. I'll just have a couple drinks. Hopefully its takes off the edgy feelin'."

00:42:24 "Nissi I wouldn't take that back!" Lily Kaise grins at Nissi Valdaire. "I agree with you!"

00:42:27 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:42:43 Lily Kaise says, "Well airlocking is pretty mean so I wouldn't do that either."

00:44:06 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

00:48:46 Vernos Bailey says, "I am confused."

00:49:01 Morris says to Vernos, "What are you confused about?"

00:49:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Spaced out a moment and come back to talking of airlocking folks."

00:49:25 Vernos Bailey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:49:29 Morris says to Vernos, "Just smokers."

00:50:18 Vernos Bailey says, "Last I checked after time near the furnance we all smell like smokers."

00:50:30 Morris Corlew says, "No no...literal....like cigs and pipes."

00:50:37 Vernos Bailey says, "Oh."

00:50:57 Nissi Valdaire says, "It's a strain on life support, it would directly reduce our range."

00:51:01 Rogue Romano finishes off a shot of chilled vodka.

00:51:08 Morris Corlew nods.

00:51:12 Rogue Romano gives a shot glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

00:51:32 Morris Corlew eats a spoonful of ice cream from a cold cherry cola float then stirs the drink, blending the ice cream and beverage together.

00:51:55 Morris Corlew upends a cold cherry cola float and drinks the rest of the creamy beverage.

00:52:27 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

00:56:27 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

00:57:47 Eli Grey takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

00:58:38 Eli says to Nissi, "I wonder if we could put a filtration on a ship for smokers, like the one they have on Foxxtrot?"

00:58:42 Eli Grey says, "Might take up too much charge."

00:58:45 Eli Grey takes a sip of a shot of chilled vodka.

00:59:48 Vernos Bailey says, "Maybe we can use the fighter for smokers."

00:59:58 Vernos Bailey says, "L sack."

01:00:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Looking for a good snack I mean."

01:00:35 Morris gestures toward the galley, then at a personal pizza oven.

01:00:40 Morris Corlew says, "Pick your poisin."

01:00:44 Vernos Bailey examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

01:00:44 Morris Corlew says, "Poison."

01:00:48 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Vernos Bailey removes a small round personal taco pizza from the open compartment.

01:01:00 Vernos Bailey says, "Taco pizza."

01:01:11 Morris Corlew nods. "Definitely poisonous."

01:01:30 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

01:02:06 Vernos Bailey says, "No you want poison."

01:02:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Try my family dog's farts."

01:02:22 Vernos Bailey says, "Worse than pierre on beans."

01:02:44 Morris Corlew laughs. "Yes, we had a couple dogs growin up."

01:03:36 Vernos Bailey says, "Gas mask quality dog gas."

01:03:49 Melinda Michaels suddenly awakens.

01:03:57 Morris Corlew nods to Vernos Bailey.

01:04:08 Morris says to Vernos, "Yeah, try feedin your family dog some of my pa's cookin."

01:04:09 Morris Corlew gags.

01:04:26 Rogue Romano says, "I'm goin' to try and nap."

01:04:29 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

01:04:31 Vernos Bailey says, "No thank you, my dog could melt the face off a person."

01:04:36 Vernos Bailey says, "As is."

01:04:36 Rogue Romano waves.

01:04:38 Morris says to Rogue, "Rest well."

01:04:41 Rogue Romano nods.

01:04:42 Vernos Bailey waves to Rogue Romano.

01:04:43 Morris Corlew chuckles at Vernos Bailey.

01:04:44 Rogue Romano slinks south.

01:05:17 Vernos Bailey says, "He would not need any help."

01:05:38 Morris Corlew says, "Feed a dog the right food, unless they're sick, usually it ain't so bad."

01:05:39 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:06:47 Vernos Bailey says, "Tell you one thing."

01:06:54 Vernos Bailey says, "Totally off topic."

01:07:40 Vernos Bailey says, "I've noticed its a lot different repairing a ship on it than when we were repairing it for you guys on the pad. I thought some of that skill would translate over but not really."

01:07:55 Morris Corlew nods.

01:07:59 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:08:04 Morris Corlew says, "We let the computer do most stuff."

01:08:41 Morris Corlew says, "Sometimes use tools for boosts and stuff, but...again, most stuff just goes through the computer. No hammering at stuff, even if we feel like it 'cause we're frustrated..."

01:08:42 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely and grins.

01:08:48 Vernos Bailey says, "Could you picture having to get out there and repairing a turret yourself."

01:08:58 Morris Corlew says, "Nope, don't wanna neither."

01:09:01 Vernos Bailey says, "During a battle."

01:09:17 Morris Corlew asks, "Exactly. Laser hits the turret you're on?"

01:09:19 Morris Corlew says, "Ouch."

01:09:51 Damien Goss says, "Pretty sure if you got hit with a ship's laser it wouldn't hurt."

01:09:56 Vernos Bailey says, "You are fixing the FTL drive and a minicannon blast comes in."

01:10:10 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

01:10:24 Morris says to Damien, "Nope, wouldn't hurt a bit 'cause you'd be vaporized."

01:10:40 Lily Kaise says, "Poof."

01:10:49 Morris Corlew nods.

01:11:44 Vernos Bailey says, "Ground crews would be cleaning the smudge that was you off the turret."

01:11:44 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

01:11:53 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

01:13:32 Vernos Bailey asks, "Could you picture a minicannon blast to tace?"

01:13:40 Vernos Bailey says, "The face I mean."

01:13:50 Morris Corlew says, "Nope. Wouldn't be a face...or a body."

01:14:02 Vernos Bailey says nothing.

01:14:19 Vernos Bailey says, "We see those things hit the hull all the time out here and it turns the plates white hot."

01:14:27 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

01:14:28 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:14:31 Vernos Bailey says, "That is a lot of energy."

01:14:51 Morris Corlew asks, "Can you imagine if somethin went wrong with ship safeties?"

01:15:02 Morris Corlew says, "I mean...folks like Aisling, Pierre, Anfisa...they lived without those."

01:15:32 Aisling the Fox gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:16:07 Aisling the Fox says, "You die."

01:16:12 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox.

01:16:17 Aisling the Fox says, "Not much to imagine."

01:16:37 Morris says to Aisling, "Kinda is for folks that take their safety for granted."

01:16:41 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Yes, is very simple."

01:16:57 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Is harder to keep air in than to let it out."

01:17:01 Aisling the Fox asks, "Dying is hard to imagine?"

01:17:14 Morris says to Aisling, "Harder when it's not a constant reality."

01:17:20 Aisling the Fox asks, "Regs suddenly do not die often?"

01:17:33 Morris says to Aisling, "Not aboard ships."

01:17:45 Aisling the Fox shrugs.

01:18:08 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Grab airtight bag, put snugly over head. Start attempting to breathe. Simulation complete."

01:18:17 Aisling the Fox grins at Anfisa of Marzore.

01:18:17 Damien Goss smiles.

01:18:19 Morris Corlew says, "The point was, we take our safety systems for granted. Folks don't think, 'Hey, I could die on this ship.'"

01:18:34 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Well, yes. That is decadence of regs."

01:18:43 Damien Goss says, "Not all regs."

01:18:50 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

01:18:52 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Yes, all regs."

01:19:10 Damien Goss stands up.

01:19:16 Damien Goss says, "Ok you knwo all."

01:19:17 Damien Goss steps south.

01:19:25 Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

01:19:27 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Well, I know reg ships."

01:19:51 Morris picks at a fingernail.

01:20:13 Aisling the Fox asks, "What is it with people named Damien?"

01:21:19 Vernos Bailey says, "I accept that pods have a nearly perfect and spotless record but does not mean something could not happen."

01:21:27 Vernos Bailey says, "I accept the possibilty."

01:21:50 "That was my point." Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Vernos Bailey. "In general, because of the safety record, we don't often think about, what if somethin went wrong?"

01:22:07 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

01:23:00 Morris says to Aisling, "Do you ever wonder, when you get aboard Oracle, what if these systems fail?"

01:23:36 Aisling the Fox says, "I trust ship. I do not trust me."

01:24:24 Morris nods slowly. "But...you do not control the safety mechanisms. So...you're saying you don't ever wonder, what if this automatic system fails?"

01:25:13 Morris Corlew says, "If you don't, then it's not just 'regs' that have this decadence."

01:25:46 Morris Corlew says, "I do. I wonder about it. So...Goss is right. It's also not all 'regs.'"

01:26:31 Aisling says to Morris, "Oracle is not put together by tiny bits of spare parts cobbled together with what can be found like my old scout was."

01:27:05 Morris says to Aisling, "It can still fail, can't it? Everything has a possibility of failure. No matter how remote. It's a part of life."

01:27:13 Aisling the Fox says, "Yes, it can."

01:27:46 Morris Corlew says, "Then, is this decadence only a reg thing? Oracle wasn't even built by regs."

01:28:11 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:28:21 Aisling the Fox says, "You are picking a fight."

01:28:23 Morris Corlew says, "Just because I've never spent time on a ship that didn't have safeties doesn't mean I don't appreciate the risk of my safeties failing."

01:28:45 Morris says to Aisling, "I'm responding to an attitude that's pretty prevalent."

01:29:01 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I like escape pods."

01:30:52 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

01:31:22 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

01:32:13 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

01:32:23 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

01:33:36 Aisling says to Morris, "I have lived a very tiny portion of life on a ship without these securities that Mutuality has provided."

01:34:02 Aisling the Fox says, "With, I mean."

01:34:20 Vernos Bailey says, "What direction are we going'"

01:34:33 Vernos Bailey asks, "Spinward, rimward?"

01:34:39 Aisling the Fox says, "And Mutuality is significantly tiny portion of unregistered peoples."

01:34:43 Morris says to Aisling, "And that means that we are not allowed to understand what it's like? That we can't 'get it' without having done it? That we can't wonder if maybe one day ours would fail?"

01:35:00 Aisling the Fox says, "It is not quite the same."

01:35:11 Aisling the Fox asks, "Have you known someone who has died in starship?"

01:35:19 Vernos Bailey says, "S."

01:35:21 Morris says to Aisling, "I've killed people in ships."

01:35:22 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

01:35:22 Morris Corlew stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

01:35:23 Morris Corlew lopes south.

01:35:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We are going downward."

01:35:46 Vernos Bailey says, "Sorry, but I see both sides of the argument and maybe this is a good place to send it."

01:35:46 Aisling the Fox says, "Good to know you are a killer of people you do not know."

01:36:06 Vernos Bailey says, "End I mean."

01:36:30 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:36:37 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:36:44 Aisling the Fox says, "I wonder if Morris would have killed those people if his life was in same danger if his ship was one that was destroyed."

01:37:00 Aisling the Fox says, "I am doubting it."

01:37:24 Melinda Michaels says, "Hmmm."

01:37:32 Lily Kaise says, "Phew."

01:37:33 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

01:37:33 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

01:38:23 Lily looks down sadly.

01:38:45 Aisling the Fox looks at Melinda Michaels and shrugs.

01:38:56 Melinda says to Aisling, "I didn't do it."

01:39:01 Aisling the Fox says, "Whatever you talked to him about, if it was about arguing with me, I do not think it sunk in."

01:39:09 Melinda says to Aisling, "It was not."

01:39:10 Aisling the Fox says, "No, of course not."

01:39:21 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:39:27 Aisling the Fox says, "Ah, from glare he gave me when you two came back, I thought it was."

01:40:07 Melinda says to Aisling, "Basically I just let him go on. Sometimes people need to release the tenseness."

01:40:34 Aisling the Fox nods.

01:40:40 Aisling the Fox says, "It did not work it seems."

01:40:41 Aisling the Fox grins.

01:40:49 Melinda Michaels nods.

01:40:51 Aisling the Fox says, "I told him he is trying to pick a fight."

01:40:51 Aisling the Fox shrugs.

01:56:43 Aisling the Fox applauds sedately.

01:57:51 Aisling the Fox asks, "Are you really that offended that you might not exactly grasp what it is like to live on ship without reg technologies?"

01:57:57 Aisling the Fox shrugs.

02:00:29 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:07:59 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Unknown space sure is big."

02:12:29 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

02:12:43 Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.

02:12:46 Aisling the Fox nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

02:15:57 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:16:23 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:17:57 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.

02:17:59 I don't understand that.

02:33:25 Lily Kaise says, "Oo neat."

02:34:26 You grin.

02:34:39 You say, "That is cool."

02:35:04 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

02:35:14 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

02:35:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:36:34 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

02:37:00 You exclaim, "This is my favorite!"

02:37:04 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:38:28 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

02:38:40 Morris Corlew says, "Name the squid. Then it'll be more like a pet. Pets like to sneak up us, so it's normal."

02:38:45 Lily Kaise says, "And oh those... arm things."

02:38:46 Morris Corlew says, "Squiddy."

02:38:58 Eli Grey smirks at Morris Corlew.

02:50:25 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings. Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down. Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pill

02:51:16 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:51:28 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins folds his legs inward and goes very still.

02:51:51 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade and chilled vodka.

02:51:57 You nod.

03:29:23 Eli Grey nods a greeting at you.

03:29:27 Morris says to Eli, "Howdy."

03:29:31 Eli Grey smiles at Melinda Michaels.

03:29:32 Eli Grey says, "Hey."

03:29:42 Vernos Bailey asks, "Any of you men have soap I could buy?"

03:29:50 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it flashes past a viewport overhead.

03:29:50 Morris Corlew laughs.

03:29:51 Vernos Bailey says, "I left mine appearently."

03:29:52 Morris Corlew stands up from a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

03:29:54 Eli says to Vernos, "I have a bar that Morris gave me."

03:29:57 Morris says to Vernos, "Don't need to buy."

03:29:58 Morris Corlew lopes south.

03:30:08 Eli Grey says, "Oh, nevermind he's got soe more I guess.. Morris the Soapmaster."

03:30:19 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:30:20 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

03:30:26 Lily Kaise says, "I gave my maple soap to Luja."

03:30:27 Morris Corlew forcefully hurls a bar of light brown spicy soap at Vernos Bailey.

03:30:27 Vernos Bailey deftly catches it.

03:30:41 Morris Corlew sits down on a white leather sofa.

03:30:45 Vernos Bailey asks, "Morris you know I have good hands, why test me?"

03:30:49 Vernos Bailey smirks.

03:31:04 Morris Corlew says to Vernos, "I dunno. Felt like stretchin my arm."

03:31:04 Morris Corlew grins.

03:31:05 Melinda Michaels says, "Gotta have that manly soap."

03:31:07 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:31:10 Lily Kaise grins.

03:31:16 Vernos Bailey says, "Be back, third shower today."

03:31:16 Morris says to Melinda, "Want me to use the jasmine?"

03:31:18 Morris Corlew sniffs at himself.

03:31:19 Lily Kaise says, "I just have girlie soap now."

03:31:27 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

03:31:27 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

03:31:28 Melinda says to Morris, "Sure."

03:31:31 Morris Corlew laughs.

03:31:40 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:31:44 Morris says to Melinda, "That or milk and honey. Think I've got a bar of that tucked away too."

03:31:50 Melinda Michaels giggles.

03:31:50 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Literally indeed my third shower today."

03:31:59 Lily Kaise sniffs at you. You can only wonder what's so interesting.

03:32:01 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Why are you showering so much? Or do we want to know?"

03:32:03 Lily Kaise says, "Yum."

03:32:06 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:34:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:34:26 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:34:26 Lily Kaise beams at you.

03:34:30 Lily Kaise grins.

03:34:49 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

03:35:09 Vernos Bailey walks into the room and shakes his slightly damp head as if he were a dog.

03:35:14 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:35:22 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Shake it shake it!"

03:35:33 You laugh.

03:35:41 Morris wipes a drop of water from his cheek and stares at Vernos. "Gee. Thanks."

03:35:51 Lily Kaise removes a small sparkly pink vinyl case from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:35:53 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

03:35:56 Vernos says to Morris, "Welcome, you looked like you needed it."

03:35:57 Lily Kaise puts a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco on a maple coffee table.

03:36:00 Morris Corlew smirks.

03:36:04 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

03:36:06 Lily Kaise removes a sparkly purple plastic hair dryer from a small sparkly pink vinyl case.

03:36:09 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:36:26 Lily Kaise says, "Ha ha I doubt you would want to use my hair dryer Vernos."

03:36:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:36:35 You laugh.

03:36:40 Melinda says to Lily, "That's a girlie hair dryer."

03:36:41 Lily Kaise pats a sparkly purple plastic hair dryer lightly.

03:36:42 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:36:43 Vernos Bailey asks, "Would you care for the soap back? I think it smells more like blast furnace now than spices?"

03:36:47 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:36:49 You chuckle.

03:36:55 Melinda flexes her muscles, "it's just not manly."

03:36:56 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:36:59 Morris says to Vernos, "Keep it for next time. Surely you shower more than when you shovel?"

03:37:12 Vernos says to Morris, "Daily."

03:37:19 Lily Kaise switches on a sparkly purple plastic hair dryer and uses it to completely dry her hair before switching it back off.

03:37:26 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:37:30 Lily Kaise puts a sparkly purple plastic hair dryer in a small sparkly pink vinyl case.

03:37:35 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:37:40 Morris says to Melinda, "Screw that. I'd use it. Color don't indicate what it does to your hair or or nothin."

03:37:41 Lily Kaise puts a small sparkly pink vinyl case in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:37:54 Vernos Bailey says, "Although I have three pairs of the same outfit, two AEU outfits and yet forgot my soap and tennis shoes."

03:37:55 Melinda says to Morris, "Really?"

03:38:10 Melinda Michaels says, "Forgetting soap can be fun."

03:38:13 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels. "Ain't gonna make me smell purple or nothin."

03:38:16 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:38:21 You grin at Melinda Michaels.

03:38:22 Morris Corlew says, "Or make me sparkly."

03:38:28 Morris Corlew asks, "Would it?"

03:38:29 Lily says to you, "Perhaps you could give him the shipsuit I got for you which is almost identical to one you already had?"

03:38:29 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

03:39:09 Melinda Michaels says, "I forgot all my clothes once. I think most of us have done that to some degree."

03:39:24 Lily Kaise says, "Well I'm sure at least showering would help if you don't have a fragrance. It's better than not showering..."

03:39:24 Vernos says to Melinda, "Did you walk onto a landing pad without them?"

03:39:25 Morris says to Melinda, "You were told to forget all your clothes, if I recall."

03:39:27 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:39:27 You nod to Lily Kaise. "If he wants it."

03:39:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:39:35 Lily Kaise asks, "Wow?"

03:39:36 Melinda Michaels nods to Morris Corlew. "I was."

03:39:40 Melinda says to Vernos, "No."

03:39:43 Morris Corlew nods and chuckles.

03:40:16 Morris says to Melinda, "I think that was the same trip where...uh..."

03:40:17 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

03:40:19 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:42:13 Morris Corlew removes a copy of "Why Does This Time-Scale Make No Sense? - An Introduction to Standardized Planetary Time" from a maple coffee table.

03:42:16 Morris Corlew puts a copy of "Why Does This Time-Scale Make No Sense? - An Introduction to Standardized Planetary Time" in an emerald green plastic box labeled 'MOOSE'S LIBRARY - Please Return When Done'.

03:44:30 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

03:44:34 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:45:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:46:35 Vernos Bailey asks, "Does the navigation computer work for distance while in the rift?"

03:46:40 Melinda Michaels says, "No."

03:46:48 Vernos Bailey says, "Was curious."

03:46:50 Melinda Michaels says, "It can't properly calculate a distance while constantly moving."

03:46:57 Vernos Bailey nods.

03:47:06 Melinda Michaels says, "Same for charters, we just can't do it."

03:47:28 Morris Corlew asks, "If I'm flyin off in a hover car, can ya tell me how many inches I am from ya?"

03:47:34 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:47:34 Melinda Michaels says, "3."

03:47:36 Vernos Bailey says, "Sure."

03:47:37 Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.

03:47:41 You laugh.

03:47:42 You grin.

03:47:48 Vernos Bailey says, "In my face because you just hit me."

03:47:55 You chuckle.

03:47:57 Morris Corlew laughs.

03:47:58 Nissi Valdaire says, "Can't even see stars in the rift. Except hallucinatory ones. So that doesn't help much either."

03:48:02 Lily Kaise nods.

03:48:05 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:48:11 You nod to Nissi Valdaire.

03:48:26 Lily Kaise says, "That is why it was joke when I stared out of the viewport."

03:48:47 You nod and grin at Lily Kaise.

03:49:19 Lily Kaise says, "Hey starry star so bright out there but where the hell cause I'm in the rift."

03:49:23 You laugh.

03:49:25 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:50:03 Lily Kaise asks, "It was moreso to do with I'm surprised that we've seen but one binary out here so far or oh were there two?"

03:50:12 Morris Corlew says, "Two."

03:50:15 Lily Kaise nods.

03:50:19 Morris Corlew says, "Two binary systems, four binary starms."

03:50:22 Morris Corlew says, "Uh stars."

03:50:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Ya never know what you will find till ya go looking."

03:50:30 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

03:50:30 Lily Kaise says, "Yup."

03:50:32 Morris Corlew gives Melinda Michaels a thumbs up!

03:50:34 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

03:50:43 You grin.

03:50:54 Lily Kaise says, "It's all awesome."

03:50:58 You smile.

03:51:09 Lily Kaise says, "More than I've seen for quite awhile."

03:54:34 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:55:01 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:55:17 Jason Rat jogs in from the south.

03:55:22 Jason Rat waves.

03:55:24 Jason Rat sits down on a white leather sofa.

03:55:37 Morris Corlew waves to Jason Rat.

03:56:32 You wave to Jason Rat.

03:57:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:58:18 Melinda says to Jason, "Yo."

03:59:16 An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and advance into the fray.

04:03:06 Aisling the Fox stands up from a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

04:03:08 Aisling the Fox sits down on Jason Rat's lap.

04:03:11 Aisling the Fox kisses Jason Rat.

04:09:19 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

04:10:03 Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and mangled stump where his right arm once was.

04:10:18 Morris Corlew mumbles. "Damn..."

04:10:30 Melinda Michaels nods. "That looks painful."

04:10:34 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:10:36 Morris Corlew nods.

04:10:43 Morris rubs his left arm.

04:10:52 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:10:52 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

04:10:53 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah sad scene."

04:10:56 Lily Kaise sighs.

04:10:57 You nod.

04:11:03 Melinda Michaels finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:11:29 Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

04:11:30 Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco.

04:12:04 Lily says to you, "Ok I'll make this my last. It would be humiliating to have to crawl to our quarters."

04:12:08 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:12:12 You laugh.

04:12:19 You say to Lily, "Nah, I'll just carry you."

04:12:36 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:12:38 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I know but I wouldn't deserve that."

04:12:42 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:12:57 You grin at Lily Kaise. "Sure you do."

04:13:05 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:13:07 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:13:08 Lily Kaise glides east.

04:13:10 I don't see that here.

04:13:19 I don't see that here.

04:13:37 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

04:25:35 Lily Kaise tips a small red and white bag of hot cheesy popcorn, shakes the last of its contents into her mouth, then crumples up the empty container and tosses it into a nearby trash bin.

04:25:46 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Good stuff!"

04:26:17 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:26:24 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:27:29 You say to Lily, "Almost ready to go lie down or not?"

04:27:36 Lily Kaise says, "Soon."

04:27:53 You nod.

04:28:35 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:30:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:30:59 A nearby soldier carefully inspects his rifle to ensure it is ready.

04:31:17 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco.

04:32:34 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

04:33:36 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Extra-Dry Prosecco.

04:33:42 Lily Kaise gives a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:33:52 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the south.

04:33:54 Cheri Lindbergh waves. "Hey."

04:33:58 Cheri Lindbergh examines a small hot tea dispenser for a moment.

04:34:01 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:34:03 Cheri Lindbergh helps herself to a cup of hot jasmine tea.

04:34:21 Lily says to Cheri, "Hey."

04:34:27 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "How's it going?"

04:34:33 Melinda says to Cheri, "Hey."

04:34:33 Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh. "Fine, fine."

04:34:35 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Going and going and going!"

04:34:37 Lily Kaise grins.

04:35:04 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a cup of hot jasmine tea.

04:35:24 Cheri Lindbergh glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

04:35:39 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Huh, interesting anyway."

04:35:45 Morris Corlew nods.

04:36:27 You wave to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:36:29 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:36:35 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:36:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Meh."

04:36:40 Cheri Lindbergh sits down on a white leather sofa.

04:36:40 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

04:36:42 Morris Corlew says, "Been awhile."

04:36:46 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:36:46 A riftstorm appears to be 1.59 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Down and Slightly Northeast.

04:37:00 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

04:37:10 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

04:37:32 Morris Corlew says, "Spideys."

04:40:17 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I like this one better than the war one."

04:40:21 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Or the volcano."

04:40:24 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

04:40:40 Melinda Michaels says, "Those are kinda scary. They can make for an uneasy sleep."

04:40:45 Morris Corlew nods.

04:40:46 Lily Kaise nods.

04:40:47 Cheri Lindbergh nods to Melinda Michaels.

04:40:57 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I wonder what the little spider pets think of this one."

04:40:58 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah they are disturbing/nightmarish."

04:41:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:41:35 Morris Corlew says, "Dunno."

04:41:37 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:41:50 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a cup of hot jasmine tea.

04:41:55 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:42:06 Lily Kaise says, "Higgins is in his own realm."

04:42:14 Morris Corlew says, "Usually is."

04:42:21 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Maybe they feel some old instinctual liking for it."

04:42:28 Lily Kaise says, "Could be."

04:42:36 You nod.

04:42:57 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Like in their teeny little mind they're going 'wheee I'm home'"

04:43:02 Lily Kaise grins.

04:43:03 You grin.

04:43:48 Lily Kaise says, "I dunno if they even have much in the way of an ability to process information other than their survival instincts."

04:44:04 Morris Corlew says, "They're genetically engineered...so who knows."

04:44:09 Lily Kaise nods.

04:44:30 Lily Kaise strokes a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

04:44:31 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

04:44:32 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Or maybe it's like their valhalla, something like that. They are among the gods."

04:44:35 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

04:44:39 Lily Kaise says, "Oh nos."

04:44:41 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:44:53 Lily Kaise says, "That's a bit of a reach."

04:44:55 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:44:59 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:45:05 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yeah but it's funny to think."

04:45:09 Lily Kaise exclaims, "It is!"

04:45:12 Morris Corlew says, "Nothin's much of a reach in the rift."

04:45:20 Lily Kaise grins.

04:47:31 Cheri Lindbergh glances down at her wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

04:48:33 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

04:49:49 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Is it all right to actually pet them?"

04:50:02 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki taps her claws on the floor.

04:50:16 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I think she's answering me, but I don't speak her language."

04:50:32 Melinda Michaels grins.

04:50:34 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:51:58 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a cup of hot jasmine tea.

04:52:10 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "So... did Emily ever show?"

04:52:16 Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:52:27 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "She better now?"

04:52:35 Morris Corlew shrugs. "No clue."

04:52:45 Melinda Michaels says, "She was sort of waking up when I went to bed but I've not seen her alert."

04:53:00 Melinda Michaels says, "I think she's just chilling, not wanting to talk."

04:53:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:55:46 Cheri Lindbergh navigates her dark metallic pink touch shoes interface to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:56:43 Cheri Lindbergh switches a dark metallic pink touch shoes interface off.

04:56:51 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a cup of hot jasmine tea.

04:57:02 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:02:04 An orange digital felo game beeps insistently for food.

05:02:14 Jason Rat presses a button on an orange digital felo game.

05:02:14 An orange digital felo game beeps hungrily as the felo rapidly empties its food bowl.

05:02:16 Jason Rat presses a button on an orange digital felo game.

05:02:16 An orange digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

05:02:35 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

05:03:00 Aisling the Fox squeezes Jason Rat affectionately.

05:03:08 Aisling the Fox says, "Feed that felo real good."

05:03:10 Jason Rat laughs.

05:03:12 Aisling the Fox grins.

05:04:07 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

05:04:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:04:35 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

05:04:49 You stretch.

05:04:58 You say, "Well, think I'm going to head to bed. Night all."

05:05:04 A black digital felo game emits a beep that slowly descends in tone as the felo goes to sleep.

05:05:17 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:05:17 You wave.

05:05:19 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:05:32 Lily Kaise waves. "Nite everyone."

05:05:34 Lily Kaise glides south.

05:05:40 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Rest well you two."

05:05:54 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks!"

05:06:06 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

05:06:13 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

05:06:16 You pull a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers off of your feet.

05:06:18 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

05:06:20 You put down a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers.

05:06:21 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

05:06:22 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

05:06:46 Cheri Lindbergh's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Later, Shule and Lily."

05:06:51 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Nite Miss Cheri."

05:06:52 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Later."

05:07:08 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:07:10 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:07:14 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:07:19 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:11:37 You say to Lily, "I love you."

05:11:42 Lily says to you, "Nite Love. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:16:26 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

05:22:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

05:26:49 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

05:28:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

05:31:03 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

05:32:51 I don't understand that.

05:38:07 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

05:38:17 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

05:52:59 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

06:08:07 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

06:13:18 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

06:17:30 There is a flash outside the window, followed by a crack of thunder which rattles the ship. Heavy drops of rain begin to fall as the ants scramble wildly to avoid them!

06:17:30 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

06:17:32 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

06:28:37 A small stream of rainwater catches the ant carrying the ship, and while it holds on, it and the ship are quickly washed down the rivulet!

06:28:38 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

06:29:04 The ant carrying the ship manages to pull itself out of the water and back to drier land.

06:29:05 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

06:30:08 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Take care Cheri."

06:30:08 A small stream of rainwater catches the ant carrying the ship, and while it holds on, it and the ship are quickly washed down the rivulet!

06:30:09 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

06:30:19 The ant carrying the ship manages to pull itself out of the water and back to drier land.

06:30:20 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

06:31:06 A Tardick lizard named Freyja trundles slowly into the area.

06:36:06 A Tardick lizard named Freyja's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

06:37:55 A small stream of rainwater catches the ant carrying the ship, and while it holds on, it and the ship are quickly washed down the rivulet!

06:38:12 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

06:38:41 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

06:38:51 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

06:41:46 The tunnel widens, the ship tumbling as it speeds through.

06:41:46 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

06:42:14 The tunnel narrows once more.

07:39:07 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

07:39:17 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

07:39:28 The carriage bumps heavily over a rock and then arrives back on the road.

07:39:29 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

07:41:18 Suddenly there is no more road ahead of you, and the carriage is plunging down a steep hillside, barely under control.

08:28:09 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

08:28:09 A dwarf star is here, a point of light with an apparent size not much bigger than far more distant stars. Only its greater brightness indicates its proximity.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

08:28:13 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Bingo."

08:28:16 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

08:33:06 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

09:18:05 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How's it goin up there?"

09:21:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

09:22:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

09:22:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

09:22:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

09:34:05 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "They all back?"

09:34:10 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup."

09:34:15 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

09:34:26 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

09:34:26 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

09:34:30 The starship has left a unique area of space.

09:34:30 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

09:34:35 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wheeee."

09:34:36 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

09:36:27 Wind kicks up behind you, driving the entire flock forward rapidly.

09:36:28 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

09:37:02 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Trim still 70 on purpose?"

09:37:05 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

09:44:34 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Zoomin though."

09:47:40 Wind kicks up behind you, driving the entire flock forward rapidly.

09:48:04 The wind dies down for a moment.

10:04:27 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

10:15:00 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

10:26:03 A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

10:27:21 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

10:35:21 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

10:35:31 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

10:37:16 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

10:49:50 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

11:05:21 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

11:05:35 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Nissi."

11:05:53 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Have a good rest."

11:09:00 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

11:19:11 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

11:26:48 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

11:37:17 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

11:37:34 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

11:37:44 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

11:44:13 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

12:01:32 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

12:11:44 The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.

12:21:59 The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.

12:32:36 The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.

12:35:08 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

12:39:31 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

12:39:40 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

13:09:31 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

13:19:57 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

13:30:44 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

13:40:02 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

13:40:12 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

14:10:03 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

14:16:24 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

14:27:02 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

14:29:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

14:30:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

14:34:12 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

14:41:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:41:37 I don't understand that.

14:41:39 Lily Kaise

14:41:40 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the collar. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, bo
14:41:40 th wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

14:41:40 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

14:41:49 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

14:41:49 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

14:41:50 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

14:45:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

14:49:25 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

15:03:10 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

15:13:31 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

Additionally, there are 10 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 20 pilots.

15:26:42 On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from scored bark and snapped branches.

15:36:54 The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight with each other.

15:44:15 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

15:44:25 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

16:14:15 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

16:24:29 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

16:34:46 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

16:38:26 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

16:44:54 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

16:46:23 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

16:46:32 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

16:49:56 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tail.

16:53:56 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

17:09:56 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

17:11:56 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tongue out.

17:16:23 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

17:22:26 A Tardick lizard named Raissa's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

17:26:41 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

17:26:49 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Now that's gorgeous."

17:33:26 A Tardick lizard named Raissa's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

17:35:56 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

17:37:13 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

17:47:56 Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.

17:49:01 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

17:49:13 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

17:53:26 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:20:58 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly east.

19:21:48 Some people stumble by on the shore, their heads twisted around to face backwards.

19:32:30 Howling, infuriated people inexplicably roll massive weights at each other, tortured bodies straining with the effort.

19:42:49 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

19:51:05 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

19:51:15 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

20:21:06 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

20:24:23 You wave.

20:24:27 You say, "Hi everyone."

20:24:32 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

20:24:32 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

20:28:31 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.

20:29:13 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Many allos."

20:29:18 You smile.

20:29:21 You wave to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

20:31:26 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

20:48:28 Vernos Bailey says, "Spending my birthday in deep space."

20:48:35 Vernos Bailey says, "Good stuff."

20:50:48 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

20:51:25 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

20:51:30 You wave to Rogue Romano.

20:52:06 Rogue Romano waves.

20:52:07 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

20:52:17 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

20:52:27 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

20:52:31 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

20:52:48 Rogue Romano slinks east.

20:53:15 Rogue Romano slinks in from the east.

20:53:20 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

20:53:23 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

20:53:26 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

20:53:34 Rogue Romano carefully unwraps a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich.

20:53:39 Rogue Romano picks up half of a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich and takes a huge bite.

20:56:48 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

21:02:48 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

21:03:20 Rogue Romano takes another large bite of a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich.

21:06:31 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's unblinking eyes stare into the middle distance.

21:15:26 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

21:18:48 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

21:22:03 Rogue Romano starts in on the second half of a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich.

21:22:18 An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.

21:32:46 An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.

21:33:32 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

21:39:07 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

21:39:08 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa.

21:39:23 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

21:39:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hey."

21:39:29 Rogue Romano waves to Nissi Valdaire.

21:39:35 Nissi Valdaire navigates her metallic purple swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

21:39:44 Nissi Valdaire switches a metallic purple swivel einrophone off.

21:40:05 Rogue Romano navigates her metallic yellow touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

21:40:44 Rogue Romano switches a metallic yellow touch einrophone off.

21:40:49 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

21:41:02 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

21:42:13 Aisling the Fox waves.

21:42:19 You wave to Aisling the Fox.

21:42:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Hay."

21:42:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We recently passed over a burning ball. We did not stop at burning ball."

21:43:10 The hovertruck spends several minutes overtaking a hovercar. Nobody appears to be in its driver's seat.

21:44:34 Vernos says to Nissi, "Hey."

21:45:09 Vernos says to Nissi, "Its my birthday. What does one do on their birthday if on an expedition?"

21:45:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Will need to find the party planet."

21:46:01 Rogue says to Vernos, "Oh hey, happy birthday Vern."

21:46:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "Find 80 planets."

21:46:34 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Woo!"

21:47:35 Eli Grey blinks heavily and then dozes off.

21:49:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Lets do that then."

21:50:00 Vernos Bailey says, "80 planets."

21:51:56 Rogue Romano grins.

21:52:05 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

21:52:13 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Vernos Bailey.

21:52:18 Rogue Romano exclaims, "Happy birthday!"

21:52:22 Rogue Romano giggles.

21:53:13 Vernos Bailey says, "Thanks."

21:53:15 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

21:53:19 Rogue Romano grins.

21:53:22 Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

21:53:25 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

21:53:26 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

21:53:30 Rogue Romano slinks south.

21:53:58 Vernos Bailey says, "If this ship had pod recall I'd suggest a short pod ride that gets recalled."

21:54:53 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Wut."

21:56:50 Vernos Bailey says, "You know oh its your birthday so we will launch you in this pod and then recall it as joke."

21:58:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well, is possible to do one half of joke already."

22:02:38 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

22:02:47 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

22:10:49 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

22:12:47 Melinda Michaels suddenly awakens.

22:12:49 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:13:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Hi."

22:13:41 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

22:14:22 Damien Goss says, "Hello."

22:15:30 Vernos Bailey says, "Hey Melinda."

22:15:40 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey."

22:16:49 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

22:17:51 Aisling the Fox waves.

22:18:18 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Allo."

22:20:06 The room grows a bit more chill.

22:30:42 You hear something fall in the next room.

22:36:22 The room grows a bit more chill.

22:46:47 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

22:46:51 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

22:53:26 The room grows a bit more chill.

22:53:48 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

22:53:58 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

22:56:51 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

22:58:51 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

22:59:09 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the south.

22:59:12 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Hey."

22:59:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Hi."

22:59:36 Cheri Lindbergh walks east.

22:59:56 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the east.

23:00:01 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Is it going good?"

23:00:02 You wave to Cheri Lindbergh.

23:00:07 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

23:00:51 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

23:01:36 Cheri Lindbergh sits down on a white leather sofa.

23:01:39 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

23:01:58 Aisling the Fox waves.

23:02:19 Cheri Lindbergh navigates her dark metallic pink touch shoes interface to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:02:32 Cheri Lindbergh switches a dark metallic pink touch shoes interface off.

23:02:45 Rogue Romano waves to Cheri Lindbergh.

23:05:15 Melinda Michaels stands up from a white leather sofa.

23:05:20 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

23:12:33 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:13:46 Aisling the Fox sniffs at herself.

23:13:55 Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

23:16:15 Cheri Lindbergh stands up from a white leather sofa.

23:16:19 Cheri Lindbergh walks south.

23:16:52 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

23:17:00 Cheri Lindbergh walks in from the south.

23:17:02 Cheri Lindbergh sits down on a white leather sofa.

23:17:17 Cheri Lindbergh glances around at her surroundings. "I know nobody smelled me."

23:23:52 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

23:29:08 Aisling the Fox sniffs at Cheri Lindbergh. You can only wonder what's so interesting.

23:29:24 Aisling the Fox says, "You have been smelled."

23:29:49 Aisling says to Cheri, "Want your opinion."

23:30:24 Cheri says to Aisling, "About what."

23:30:29 Cheri Lindbergh sniffs at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec. You can only wonder what's so interesting.

23:30:34 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Huh."

23:30:58 Aisling the Fox says, "Morris was rather angry yesterday at suggestion that regs do not quite understand what it is like to live on ship that lacked securities their ships have."

23:31:56 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "So what are you asking my opinion about?"

23:32:25 Aisling the Fox says, "I asked if he has ever known someone who died in a starship as a point. He said he has killed people in starships and stormed off."

23:32:38 Cheri Lindbergh snorts.

23:32:40 Aisling the Fox says, "My question is whether this point of view is off base."

23:32:55 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Okay, good answer, Morris. As in not an answer."

23:33:11 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

23:33:14 Morris Corlew waves.

23:33:22 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:33:31 Rogue Romano waves.

23:33:35 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

23:33:36 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

23:33:42 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

23:34:21 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

23:34:33 Cheri says to Aisling, "Anyway yeah, I think a lot of regs have no idea what it's like."

23:34:43 Aisling the Fox nods.

23:34:52 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Like the other cycle we were talking about those little devices that make noise, music or whatever."

23:35:21 Aisling the Fox asks, "Which devices?"

23:35:39 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Like a little music box."

23:35:49 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh."

23:35:53 Cheri Lindbergh says, "We were imagining one that made different noises."

23:36:00 Cheri Lindbergh says, "And Anfisa said she would find the sound of ship noises comforting, like as a sign that everything was okay."

23:36:11 Aisling the Fox nods.

23:36:13 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

23:36:20 Nissi Valdaire says, "White noise."

23:36:24 Cheri Lindbergh says, "To me, I'd just get homesick, but I think that's something most regs would never consider."

23:36:27 Aisling the Fox says, "Yes."

23:36:27 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yeah."

23:37:53 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "But no, you can't get mad just because someone else had a different life of things you don't understand, like how the FUCK do people swim in ponds? I don't get it. I can't swim in ponds, there could be brain-eating amoebas in there. How could you not worry about it?"

23:38:06 Aisling the Fox says, "Like, I am okay sitting here and sleeping with everyone in same room. It is not weird or uncomfortable. I lived in dormitory with members of Sept. No sense of real privacy."

23:38:23 Morris Corlew looks at Cheri Lindbergh thoughtfully.

23:38:43 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Ah, but I like my own room. Or just a roommate. I love having a whole apartment to myself, it's so extreme."

23:39:21 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh, I do not mind my living quarters on Oracle and sharing with Jason. It is nice. But I am accustomed to not having that."

23:39:34 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I got used to it real quick."

23:39:39 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not think I would like a whole apartment though. Too much space."

23:39:46 Aisling the Fox says, "Not sure what to do with it."

23:39:55 Cheri says to Aisling, "You'd think of things to do with it."

23:40:03 Morris Corlew says, "Thing to consider is we all have different experiences too. There are 'regs' who grew up with many brothers and sisters that are also used to sleeping with little privacy."

23:40:31 Cheri says to Aisling, "Like this here is a room where I sit and read books, this other room is where I watch videos. Like that."

23:40:52 Aisling the Fox says, "It is a little different when you are doing it as adult. With other adults. And have no choice but to do it. That is point."

23:40:52 Cheri says to Aisling, "Hey and two bathrooms, I mean TWO BATHROOMS."

23:40:57 Aisling the Fox grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

23:41:38 Aisling the Fox asks, "Why do you need two bathrooms?"

23:41:56 Morris says to Aisling, "Not necessarily. Folks do it for other reasons as adults."

23:42:07 Cheri says to Morris, "Well sure but the point was that there are things about living on a ship that most people who came from planets never realize. Are you going to argue about this?"

23:42:36 Morris says to Cheri, "No. I'm just sayin ya can't lump folks and their experiences into categories and judge them based on that."

23:42:51 Morris Corlew says, "No group is all something or all something else."

23:43:14 Aisling the Fox says, "Not judging. Just saying that it is an experience they do not understand. Not saying they are better or worse for it."

23:43:22 Morris Corlew says, "I'm also capable of understandin things you may not think I'm capable of understandin."

23:43:57 Cheri says to Morris, "Well woop."

23:44:42 Morris says to Cheri, "Really? So if I started talkin 'Uregs this' and 'Unregs that,' would it bother ya?"

23:44:42 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Anyway yeah, there are definitely things weird about planets too, like... if you just went to the day side of a planet, you get this disconnected feeling like you are really nowhere, but at night, it all falls back into place."

23:45:19 Cheri says to Morris, "Nah, it probably wouldn't unless you were lying."

23:45:43 Morris says to Cheri, "Overgeneralizations don't bother you at all?"

23:46:46 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

23:46:59 Cheri says to Morris, "Well, considering that this conversation started about people who live on ships and people who don't, it looks like it's you throwing out the overgeneralizations, not me. You're talking about judging groups of people, I'm talking about bathrooms."

23:47:24 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not think it over generalization to say regs don't know what it is like to live on ship without such safeties reg ships have. Because they do not."

23:48:16 Aisling the Fox says, "That is just a fact statement. Again not saying they or I am better or worse for it. Just that it is what it is. M."

23:48:21 Morris says to Aisling, "No, but sayin we're incapable of thinkin about the danger involved is another thing. Just 'cause I've never lived on one don't mean I can't understand that my own can fail and have thought about it."

23:48:46 Aisling the Fox says, "Thinking about things and experiencing it first hand are different though."

23:49:07 Morris says to Aisling, "You have experienced your ship blowing up and it killin ya?"

23:49:26 Aisling eyes widen.

23:49:30 Morris Corlew asks, "Well?"

23:49:31 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

23:49:44 Aisling the Fox asks, "You are really asking me this? You know why I am here?"

23:49:57 Aisling the Fox says, "My ship had catastrophic explosion."

23:50:10 Aisling the Fox says, "I could be dead. My people could be dead."

23:50:13 Aisling the Fox exclaims, "All of them!"

23:50:17 Aisling the Fox exclaims, "You ask me this?!"

23:50:24 Aisling the Fox exclaims, "How dare you!"

23:50:27 Morris says to Aisling, "You are here because it hasn't happened to you. Therefore while you may have lived under a higher fear of it happenin, it didn't happen to you...just as it hasn't happened to me."

23:50:34 Aisling the Fox stands up from a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

23:50:37 Aisling the Fox prances south.

23:50:37 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

23:50:55 Morris Corlew shakes his head as if to himself.

23:50:58 Cheri says to Morris, "Now you've done it."

23:51:05 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

23:51:13 Morris says to Cheri, "Confronted her thinkin on somethin?"

23:51:21 Nissi Valdaire says, "You know... most spacers that I know have lost friends or family to ship failures, pirate attacks, stuff like that."

23:51:31 Nissi says to Morris, "I don't think you and I can say the same."

23:51:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "So have a little sensitivity."

23:51:51 Morris says to Nissi, "No, but we've seen it happen. Most of us have. I'm not tryin to be insensitive. I just..."

23:51:54 Morris lowers his eyes.

23:52:04 Nissi Valdaire says, "Not to people we know."

23:52:16 Morris Corlew says, "I don't have to know somebody to feel somethin."

23:52:37 Vernos Bailey gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

23:53:44 Cheri Lindbergh says, "That wasn't the point anyway."

23:54:00 Nissi Valdaire says, "Having lived in ships for a few weeks at a time here and there, here's what I don't understand about spacers."

23:54:14 Nissi Valdaire says, "How they do this their whole lives without murdering each other after too many conversations like these."

23:54:14 Nissi Valdaire grins.

23:54:20 Vernos Bailey grins.

23:54:23 Morris Corlew looks at Nissi Valdaire thoughtfully.

23:54:32 Damien Goss says, "Probably don't have conversations like these."

23:54:43 Cheri Lindbergh says, "No shit, you should have seen it when all us girls got our periods at the same time."

23:54:51 Cheri Lindbergh says, "My poor dad."

23:55:03 Damien Goss asks, "How many sisters?"

23:55:07 Damien Goss asks, "Or girls?"

23:55:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe not. I guess you learn what topics to avoid. We're too used to always having more space to run to."

23:55:25 Morris Corlew says, "Seems all of us are."

23:55:26 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

23:55:28 Morris Corlew says, "Not just regs."

23:55:30 Nissi Valdaire says, "About a week into these trips, we always get tempers flaring."

23:55:42 Nissi Valdaire says, "Always worse after turnaround."

23:55:54 Damien Goss says, "I only got upset yesterday because I don't like people telling me what I think and how I think."

23:55:57 Vernos Bailey says, "We have not even turned around yet."

23:56:02 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Goss.

23:56:03 Melinda Michaels says, "I didn't do it."

23:56:06 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

23:56:11 Morris says to Melinda, "I did."

23:56:11 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

23:56:13 Damien Goss says, "I didn't want to argue, so I went to bed."

23:56:21 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

23:56:45 Nissi Valdaire says, "I know. Just sayin I bet more of this will happen. But it shouldn't be too bad, we're all friends for the most part."

23:56:49 Damien Goss nods.

23:56:51 Melinda says to Morris, "You and Damien into it again?"

23:56:58 Damien Goss says, "Not me, I didn't do anything."

23:57:02 Morris Corlew chuckles and shakes his head at Melinda Michaels. "Nah."

23:57:03 Melinda says to Damien, "Oh."

23:57:10 Damien Goss says, "I've just been watching the rift controls."

23:57:21 Damien Goss says, "Waiting for a quasar."

23:57:54 Morris says to Melinda, "Just the whole reg versus unreg there's now way I can understand this or that is gettin old."

23:58:02 Vernos says to Nissi, "Would have expected us AEU pilots to be causing the rucus eh?"

23:58:12 Melinda Michaels nods to Morris Corlew.

23:58:17 Nissi Valdaire says, "Not really."

23:58:28 Morris rubs his temples.

23:58:31 Nissi Valdaire says, "Anything can flare up."

23:58:35 Eli Grey asks, "Did someone say AEU pilots?"

23:58:36 There appear to be about 21 pilots recently active.

23:58:38 Vernos says to Nissi, "Sorry just trying to defise the tension."

23:58:43 You blink heavily and then doze off.

23:58:43 Eli rubs his eyes.

23:58:44 Vernos Bailey says, "Defuse."

23:58:52 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

23:58:52 Damien says to Eli, "Vernos is saying that all AEU pilots are bad."

23:59:12 Eli Grey smirks at Damien Goss.

23:59:25 Eli says to Damien, "Somehow I doubt that's exactly what he said."

23:59:27 Vernos says to Eli, "I was trying to joke about AEU pilots always getting in trouble and defuse the tension. I think it failed."

23:59:27 Eli Grey chuckles.

23:59:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "It's like when a prisoner stabs another cuz he borrowed a book without asking or whatever. Our entire world is in this little ship and little things start to seem super important until we can get out again and get some perspective back."

23:59:42 Damien Goss nods.

23:59:49 Eli Grey asks, "Oh.. there's tension?"

23:59:57 Vernos Bailey nods to Nissi Valdaire.
