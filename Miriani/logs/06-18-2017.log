[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

01:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
A blue flight control scanner announces, "This is Pluto to Savius flight control, an AIE starship is about to land."

01:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

01:17 The computer announces, "This vessel's local archive of the Galactic News has been updated with new material."

01:21 [Pluto; Loretech Industries]
In sharp contrast to the rest of Pluto, the inside of this building is quite high tech. There are parts for all different models of Lore computers on shelves, though the newer items are kept secure in closely watched display cases. Several droids mill around stopping to check if customers need assistance as well as helping them with their bags once they've made a purchase. Through a back door that swings open as someone walks through it you see an area that appears to be used to repair broken Lore computers. Occasionally, the sound of a register ringing up transactions can be heard over the voices of the droids and customers.
You see a helpful salesman and a helpful sign here.

01:24 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

01:24 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
A blue flight control scanner announces, "Neptune to Savius flight control, an AIE starship is outbound."

01:24 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:24 A blue flight control scanner announces, "Zander to Bellerophon flight control, we have an inbound AIE starship."

01:24 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:24 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:24 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:25 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:25 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
A blue flight control scanner announces, "This is Zander to Bellerophon flight control, an AIE starship is about to land."

01:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

01:25 You peer out and see...

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

02:02 ["Starlight Express" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, though it contains no information of value in its unpowered state. The room is eerily silent without any of the ship's systems being powered. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

02:05 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a portable garden and a gleaming red security drone here.
You can go south and out.

02:05 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:05 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

02:05 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:05 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:06 The ship is already moving.

02:06 The ship is already moving.

02:06 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:06 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:06 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:06 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:06 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:06 Those coordinates are currently occupied.

02:06 The five-person transverser "Iridescence" has initiated an intrasector wavewarp.

02:06 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 11, 8."

02:06 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:06 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:06 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:06 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:06 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

02:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:06 The five-person transverser "Iridescence" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

02:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

02:06 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:06 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

02:09 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:09 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:09 You make a selection on a compact transparent Lore computer.

02:09 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]

Tracking authorization refused from LoreTech device "Kitty."
The one-person expediter "The Nexus" has jumped into the sector.

02:09 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:09 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:09 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:09 The one-person expediter "The Nexus" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

02:09 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:09 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:09 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

02:09 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:10 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:10 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:10 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:10 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

02:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:10 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:10 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

02:10 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 25490; Garage.

02:23 A letter

Dear tibo My Love! I am so sad ... I know I had left my kids and robots in your trannie but here I noticed you had left. I initially thought you just went out for work ... then I saw my things in the garage. I didn't think much of it but I went over to Acrylon to look around in your trannie for some other things that I knew were still in there and I noticed that i no longer have a key! Pray to the stars ... what is wrong? What did I do for you to just leave me like this? I also checked the keys to the apartment and noticed yours was gone so I guess you threw that away? I then noticed you've deleted our private link and you're not allowing me to track you anymore. I know what I said the other day may have seemingly been hurtful towards you. I honestly meant nothing towards you at all. I just meant that I am so fed-up with the heavy-handed tactics of others. I would hate to be a new pilot these days, just trying to make a few credits and everytime they try to launch, they are hurled into a mine field and lose everything. I can afford it but they can't. I just find it painful to observe this going on day after day and my first inclination is to run away from all of this madness! You know too, I didn't say I would leave right away as I wanted you to have the opportunity to do more work and to decide if you truly wanted to go with me. I am enclosing another key to the apartment. You are still welcome anytime even if you don't w
02:23 ant to stay with me. I love you Tibo, more than you will ever know. Please come back ... oh please do come back. If you just can't, please then, I believe I do deserve an explanation as to why I was all of a sudden abandoned by the man who I consider to be the most awesome man in the Universe. I love you Tibo. - Kitty

(You finish reading.)

02:23 Kitty Mars says, "oh it's the least I could do."

02:24 Kitty Mars asks, "I don't want you going around in that garb though. please stay here so I can go get you something decent to wear ok?"

02:24 Tibo Beauchene reads the letter in his hand and looks up and kisses you

This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor.

The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

12:39 You now have a droid remote titled "Empanda".

12:39 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:39 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

12:40 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:40 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
(Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has undocked from Empanda Station.

12:40 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:40 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:40 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:40 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

12:40 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:40 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 14, 10, 3."

12:40 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:40 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:41 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:41 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

13:02 The red light above the door to the west turns on. A pair of ominous-looking stun turrets lower from the ceiling, suggesting that this isn't a regular decontamination.

13:02 A pleasant female voice announces, "The decontamination process is beginning. This will take only a moment. Please remain calm."

13:02 The nozzles on the floor and ceiling start to spray a thick white gas into the room.

13:03 The room is filled with the thick fog. It is surprisingly easy to breathe, and cleanses your lungs as you take a breath of it in.

13:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

13:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

13:04 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:04 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

13:33 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Zander; Lukco Robotics Landing Platform.
You see a portable garden, a gleaming red security drone, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

13:33 [Newbie] Marcus Henderson: Oh, okay. Thaks. I use systems 1 when hauling, so probably a good idea to leave the the little one in a safe place then. Don't' want someone nabbing her.

13:34 You don't see "zander" in a thin red leather messenger bag.

13:34 You remove a shopping bag with "Zander; Lukco Robotics Cybernetic Disruption Technologies" printed on the front from a black leather briefcase.

13:34 You can't dump a shopping bag with "Zander; Lukco Robotics Cybernetic Disruption Technologies" printed on the front into a black ammunition container.

13:34 You remove a ten pack of pulse energy packs from a shopping bag with "Zander; Lukco Robotics Cybernetic Disruption Technologies" printed on the front.

13:35 You load a ten pack of pulse energy packs into a black ammunition container.

13:35 A black ammunition container

13:35 This black ammunition storage container has a variety of compartments that allow one to load ammunition into it with ease. On one side is a small hook that is for attaching the container to a belt or a piece of clothing.
It is loaded with fifty photoballistic magazines, fifty high-capacity magazines, twenty-five Praelor-lethal magazines, and fifty ten shot energy packs.

13:36 You deftly draw a stun turret from a soft black leather stun weapon holster.

13:36 You deftly insert a stun turret into a soft black leather stun weapon holster.

13:36 You peer out and see...

13:36 [Zander; Lukco Robotics Landing Platform]
This landing area looks to be a testing platform for the various models of droid and drone. You notice sanitation drones darting back and forth cleaning the area while droids march in and out of starships and various areas of the facility.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see Pop the droid and Wave the droid here.
You can go north, up, and down.

13:36 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

13:36 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:36 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

13:36 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:36 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

13:37 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:37 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:37 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:37 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:37 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:37 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:37 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:37 The starship is already moving.

13:37 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:37 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:37 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

13:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

A single stone staircase leading from the garage below curves upwards into this large glassed-in chamber. The granite floor has been faded to a dull off-white by the Sun which beats down through the domed glass ceiling during the day. An assortment of abandoned drones and droids stand silent in the center of the room, leaving a space around the perimeter empty. From this lofty vantage point atop the uppermost point of the spaceport, the entire capitol city is visible far below. The towering buildings and the busy streets sprawl out far into the distance all around the spaceport, and only in the far distance are trees visible. The noise and clamor of the landing pad is far quieter here.

13:50 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and a space station have been detected in the sector."

13:51 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

13:55 Jenaia the droid

13:55 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a red keychain with "beer lover for life" printed on it.

13:59 You can't launch from here.

13:59 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:59 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

13:59 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

13:59 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

14:00 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

14:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

14:01 [Private | Doraleigh Soto] You transmit, "Hi cutie."

14:01 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:01 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

14:01 You peer out and see...

14:01 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

14:01 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

14:01 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

14:01 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Undying Dissidence", and the five-person transverser "Estimesta" landed here.

14:03 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a portable garden, a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south and out.

14:03 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:03 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

14:03 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:03 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:03 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:03 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:03 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

14:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

14:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

14:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

14:26 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

14:26 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

14:50 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

14:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hellion, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:50 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

14:50 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:50 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

14:50 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:51 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

14:51 The computer announces, "Four planets have been detected in the sector."

14:51 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:51 I don't understand that.

14:51 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 15, 12, 8."

14:51 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:51 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:51 The starship is already moving.

14:51 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:51 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:51 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

14:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Hellion. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

14:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

14:51 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

14:51 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

15:54 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862" and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" powered down here.

The front half of this large trading center is filled with the various terminals flashing with menus to buy and sell commodities. Pilots wander in and out pursued by cargo drones hauling enormous crates to and from the landing pad. The dull gray floor has a slight metallic sheen under the harsh lights set into the ceiling. At the back of the open room, past the video screens flashing with the latest news and trade reports is the cargo area. Stacks of crates line the walls and teeter precariously in the middle of the floor. Drones rush about in seeming confusion, rearranging and removing cargo to fill the steady stream of orders.

16:11 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862" and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Undying Dissidence", the five-person transverser "Estimesta", and the one-person expediter "Saving Myself" landed here.

18:25 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

18:26 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

19:00 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

19:12 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

19:46 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a compact transparent Lore computer, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, and a black stun armor storage bag.

19:46 You are carrying a droid remote titled "Outreach" in your left hand and a droid remote titled "acrylon" in your right hand.

19:46 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862" and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Undying Dissidence", and the five-person transverser "Estimesta" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess th

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862" and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the five-person transverser "Estimesta", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Vis Vindico" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid

Dear all pilots, I wouldn't normally do something like this. Recently we've suffered with a very bad plague in the galaxy, it originally was the fraud org Insanity. I am afraid way too many pilots were hood winked in to joining this atrocity. Fawkes stole money and demanded a fee to leave this pit of an organisation, where the org has now been disbanded by someone who had a heart I am still concerned this con artist may still try his awful antics. So I am offering an award for anyone who informs me of his where abouts or even captures this gutter rat. Remember he's a danger, he doesn't assist in fighting praelor, he has a bc which he's only got a bounty on for blowing up an industrial ship. So fellow pilots, please stay safe and dont' fall into any of this vile humans tricks.
Stay Safe and keep your eyes pealed.
Yours truly Anton Navarro.

Greetings,

Mister Anton Navarro decided to leave out the fact that I worked for him, and he in fact paid me for many of the things I have done in the past. He has also had his battlecruiser bountied and destroyed by bounty hunters, so I don't understand this conceit. I am not antagonizing anyone, our organization is gone, This is honestly nothing more than a witch hunt at this point and apparently I am the scapegoat this time.

Just a short time ago, Uncle Anton was asking us to end hostilities, and to get along with members of his organization. We kindly obliged his request, with the understanding that we were going to work together in the future. We shared a metafrequency channel and often collaborated on finding and capturing people - generally at the whim of Anton himself.

You can condemn me all you want, but it doesn't change who you are. I have been on invasions, my battlecruiser has been involved in invasions, I apologize for it not being up to your standard or number. Honestly if everyone who didn't crew every invasion got their BC license revoked, we wouldn't have very many battlecruiser pilots left.

Please look at yourselves before you judge me in any way shape or form. The only people calling for my condemnation are those who have done nothing but commit unlawful acts against others their entire careers. Nothing I say will make anyone believe one way or the other, but how can I call for peace in the universe, a Universal Protection Initiative and social justice for all living beings and again stoop to the level of verbally harassing others and fighting amongst other humans.

I have certainly in the past been guilty of taking advantage of others, I freely admit that, but in turn I have also helped many other pilots to succeed and thrive. I won't begin to pretend that I am a saint, but neither are those who are now 'accusing' me of all of these apparently heinous acts. If people believe that I have done such horrible things, why has no one done or said anything about it until now? I find it quite curious.

Did I take money from people who left my org without so much as a word? Yes, absolutely, and at least I had a reason for doing so. My 'accusers' have taken money from many of you in the past, and without such a reason. The bottom line here is, I want to apologize, I want to say that I am sorry to any of those who felt slighted by their membership in Insanity. I also want to say that I am sorry that there are extremely jealous pilots out there who can't stand it when you have something that they don't.

Say what you want, I will continue to be
22:28  the bigger man now and ignore your vulgar sexual comments and wild accusations of impropriety. You can keep whining and complaining all you want, but this is pretty pathetic, and I would think that 'responsible' battlecruiser pilots would have something better to do than schoolyard style bullying. Furthermore, simply because someone does not want to fight you, that does not make them a coward. On the contrary, fighting is the easy way out.

Deepest Sympathies,
Fawkes Fogwell

I really wasn't going to post anything untill i saw the load of bs fawkes just posted
Fawkes sent Calyssa and i this letter, just a couple days before grabbing and stranding me, unprovoked
Hello Calyssa,
Since you wouldn't get a link with me I figured I would try sending you a file. I am sorry for all the things that have been said on both sides and sorry for whatever losses there have been. I wish we could just move past this and let bygones be bygones. I really am a good guy and do a lot to help my organization and new pilots to succeed. I don't think we should be enemies anymore. I don't want to fight you guys or have any issues with either one of you verbally, I think you guys were a lot cooler and nicer before all this. Remember we all used to be friends.
Regards,
Fawkes

Except you never replied and accepted this apology, and in fact, continued provoking me - not that I was grabbing you for provoking me to begin with. Maybe if you knew a little more of what was going on it would make sense. Thank you for showing everyone how nice I am trying to be while you are all being nothing but immature. All you are exposing here is yourself, Michael, and I hope that you remember this when it is your turn to be betrayed by people claiming to be friends!

Sincerely,
Professor Fawkes Fogwell

Dearest Michael,

How is it that you can decide what 'everyone' knows? Actually nothing changed about your general demeanor towards me, and you continued to make your condescending 'comments' regarding me on the comms. Don't begin to think that you can fool people into thinking you aren't unreasonably proud of yourself.

I guess you must be God then, Michael Calaway, since you know everything!

Yours Truly,
Professor Fogwell

Farks Frogwanker, how do you live with yourself? Why do you assume that because you were literally screwing 75 people out of their money on a daily basis that anybody is even remotely jealous of you? Every single day, you called your organization members idiots, morons and sheep. So knock off the hypocrisy.

Cara West,


I have tried to crew diffs on many occasions, and if High Guard needed to I am sure they could pull up the General communications history going back and find me offering missions. Unfortunately, much like many others, I have not been able to always get a crew. Likewise for invasions, often by the time I arrive I am too late to crew, and become a crewmember of a battlecruiser already flying. Honestly, I don't understand why this is being called into question. There have also been threats against my battlecruiser being attacked by the crew while on missions, including putting sabotage devices onboard. I have done nothing remotely wrong.

Not to warrant these accusations against my battlecruiser or license.

Pleasantly Yours,
Doctor Fawkes

He goes from "Professor" to "Doctor". Tell me, Farks. Where are your credentials? Can you prove that you deserve these titles? Or did you just make them up to boost your justifiably non-existent self-esteem?

Hello Jason,

My, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Up until a week ago you were talking to me daily and expressing the fact that my organization was a pile of trash. The organization was gone now, I don't have a single credit of the money, so I don't understand where this conceit comes from - oh yes, jealousy. If you want to talk about hypocrisy, lets talk about how you call people whores all the time for moving from boyfriend to girlfriend quickly? Or your abuse and torture of pilots for no good reason other than they disagreed with your verbal abuse on the comms. This is truly pathetic.


Warmest Regards,
Fawkes Fogwell

I'll be quick, because I don't feel the need to write pages upon pages to reply to an accusation and waste everyoen's time with drivel like you do. But: I'm a part of that oh-so-secret pirating metaf that you're talking about, and I haven't seen it once be used to coordinate pirating attacks like you claim. I also have been talking to Anton, and he claims that he doesn't remember ever paying you for any of the ridiculous extortion actiives that you undertook--mind giving us a list of when exactly this took place so that you can refresh our memories? Furthermore, I haven't seen you run a mission or crew for an invasion since April--and it's not because you have then, but because I can't speak for before then. You know that the reason that we didn't wage waro n you before now is because Anton likes Cria. Stop acting like it was us being high and mighty. We never claim not to pirate, but we're honorable, and don't extort people to make them do what we want. 
Someone who thinks you should stop lying out your ass,
Joseph Navarro

Mister Harkness,

A Professor is a Doctor. I was trained at the Terran Sciences Academy on Earth over 100 years ago and I am currently doing independent research at Asylum Research Institute. My primary center of research and study is DNA, but I am also well versed in ancient civilizations, religions and cult worship of deities.

I am a Doctor because I have a Doctorate in DNA Research, I am a Professor because I have taught and currently teach my research and Doctrine. I will be happy to give someone a tour of my laboratories and show examples of my research. I currently have two books printed with more on the way. This further goes to prove how much of a pathetic witchhunt this is.

Sincerely,
Doctor Fawkes Fogwell, P.H.D.

Are you capable of doing anything but lying?
We have intelligence that states, and I quote, that there was 5 million or less in your organization's funds at the time of its disbanding. Someone clearly withdrew all of the money that people were making, and I'd be happy to bet my hard-earned credits (that I didn't mooch off of other people) that that person was you.
Every other sentence in these board posts is a lie or mistruth. I really can't be bothered to list them all.

Dude, just give it up. Seriously. You go from being a 30 something man to a 19 year old girl to a 112 year old man and claim to be a clone. One with all these "degrees" no less. Are you just trying to make people think you're smarter than you actually are for all the bullshit?

Hello Noah Holland,

No, nothing in my post was a lie and I have none of this money. The owner of the organization is holding it for safe keeping, along with the properties of the organization. Unfortunately since it was disbanded in such a way, we don't have a lot of options for reimbursing anyone right now. I am sure your intelligence source was probably the same one who disbanded it, so I don't really see where this line of accusation is going.

Also Noah, I have known you in the past to take as much as 500 million from others as a response to something as simple as responding to you in a way that you don't like, so I don't understand your accusations or where they are coming from.

I worship Gods, I do not pretend that I am one in any sense of the imagination, I freely admit my faults and do not lie.

Yours Truly,
Professor Fogwell

Next he'll call himself "Supreme Deity Friggs Fudgebiter". Seriously, all he wants is attention and I, for one, am finished giving it to him. He is beneath my contempt and will be ignored as such. I strongly urge everybody else to follow suit, lest he get an even more swollen head or ego.

UPDATE:

Fawkes and presumably Cria have started a new private organization. This organization is named Infinity, and will be treated in the same manner as Insanity was previously. This is simply another reincarnation of the old, and I have no doubt nothing has changed. For information on what will be happening, please see board post 87641. Thank you for your attention.

UPDATE:

Noah will attack anyone he wants regardless of what organization they are in or not. This has nothing to do with organizations or anything of the sort, and everything to do with Noah, Anton and their org mates wanting to have some flimsy reason to attack innocent people. If these people are innocent, subjugated, forced, slaves, tormented by their very existence, why then are you further threatening them? They were threatening to attack former Insanity members, now they are threatening with this.  

It doesn't matter what organization anyone is a member of or former member of, if Noah wants to attack you, he is going to do it, regardless of who you are friends with, or what groups you choose to associate with. It is barbaric and the opposite of progress for such human beings to be allowed to go around involving themselves in such a way in the affairs of others. I will continue to ignore these personal attacks, slander, abuse and harassment and live my life as I choose to do, as you should all choose to do. If you choose to be in an organization, you shouldn't let someone else come along and tell you what to believe in.

The expan
22:37 sion of the human consciousness is the most important step in mankind reaching the next level of civilization. Nothing is going to get accomplished in this war filled existence. Honestly I wish you luck in all of your endeavors, but you say that I have intimidated people, I have forced them to do things against their will, and yet what is it that you are doing now? One thing I have found through my social experiments is that there is no way to force anyone to do anything, there has to be some amount of willingness for them to proceed with the action.

Thank you for all your concern and attention in this matter, but we can take it from here, thanks.

Sincerely,
Professor Fawkes Fogwell

Why, then, Supreme Overlord of the Underworlf Farks Frogshagger, are you adding people to your new organization that you yourself admitted were the epitome of moronic if not to subjugate them and make them into your dorkies?

now you're a researcher in an Asylum instatute? you're supposed to be a pilot. but then again you're the same person who claims to be a clone. and yes intimidation. when someone wants to leave, you charge them and when they don't pay you put a price on their head. oh wait you actually kicked out the ones who wanted to leave then put a price on their heads. sorry foxy, or is it fawksy. you've flipped gender too many times for me to be sure what you are, but a leopard doesn't change it's spots.
at least noah and anton and the others have honor. you. do not.

Hello Cara,

Thank you for your ignorant, bigoted and slanderous remarks, much appreciated. Yes I am a pilot, but that doesn't mean that I don't have other endeavours in my life. If you'd like I can show you my laboratories sometime. If you read some of my research, which is published, you may understand what you are saying a little bit better. It is nice to splice together out of context bits and pieces into some kind of narrative.

I apologize that you felt as though you were not fairly treated, but you are the one who instigated any pursuit of you, just as others instigated their pursuits. I never started anything with you and you decided that you were more important than the organization leader, it is not my problem that you have this holier than thou attitude, Cara, no one is perfect.

Someday you will understand the error in your ways, as I have, and move on with your life. For now you can continue to slander others, make up selfish narratives and be an ignorant, bigoted person. So what if I am a clone? So what if I was transgendered? Changed names? What does any of this have to do with anything?

Honestly you, and others, need t
22:39 o go back to grade school, because you are acting like a bunch of schoolyard children.

Truly Yours,

Professor Fawkes Fogwell

For somebody who is just going to ignore all the remarks made against him and go on with his life, you sure are responding to everything, Major Froglicker.

Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862" and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" powered down here.

22:51 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

22:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hellion, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:51 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The eight-person gunship "Hellion" has launched from Acrylon.

22:51 The ship is already moving.

22:51 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:51 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:51 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:51 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

22:51 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The eight-person gunship "Hellion" has left the sector.

22:51 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:51 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:51 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:52 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:52 Those coordinates are currently occupied.

22:52 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 13, 7, 1."

22:52 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:52 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:52 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:52 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:52 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Hellion. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:53 You make a selection on a compact transparent Lore computer.
