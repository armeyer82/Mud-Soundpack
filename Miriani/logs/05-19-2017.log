05:43 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south and out.

05:43 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport. A curved ivory reading lamp is casting a warm dim violet light throughout the room.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

05:44 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

05:44 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

05:44 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

05:44 You remove a droid remote titled "Empanda" from a black leather briefcase.

05:44 [TSS] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Anyone know if they have Empanda all blockaded and such?"

05:45 [TSS] Michael Calaway transmits, "Should be ok."

05:45 [TSS] Michael Calaway transmits, "Amy shot down blockades."

05:45 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

05:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

05:45 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

05:45 [TSS] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Cool, thanks."

05:45 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

05:45 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

05:45 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

05:45 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

05:45 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

05:45 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.

05:45 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

05:45 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

05:45 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

05:45 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

05:45 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

Planets: (4, 4, 7)

Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)

Current Coordinates: (4, 18, 5)

05:45 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

05:45 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

05:45 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

05:45 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

05:45 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

05:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

05:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

05:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:45 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has docked with Empanda Station.

05:45 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

05:45 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

22:09 ["Rose of Light" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a diamond-encrusted rose-colored medical drone here.

22:17 ["Rose of Light" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

22:41 You peer north and see...

22:41 ["Rose of Light" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

23:01 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:01 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:01 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:01 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:01 You hear an electrical zapping sound as repairs to the ship continue.

23:02 You peer out and see...

23:02 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the four-person roborant "Hellfire" and the eight-person gunship "Another Winter's Night" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Brita the droid, Bodil the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Mjolnir the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Yugi the droid, Chitter the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, and Beta the droid here.

23:30 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

You can go south and out.

23:30 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:30 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

23:30 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:30 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

23:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:30 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

23:30 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:30 Invalid sector.

23:30 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:30 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:30 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

23:30 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:30 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.

23:30 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:30 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

23:30 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:30 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:30 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:30 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

23:30 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:30 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

23:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

23:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:31 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has docked with Empanda Station.

23:31 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:31 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
