a dent in their bolt thrower inventory."

[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The fact that they left so
quickly pretty much confirms my thought that they were probably there to maybe
get a new shipment of rentals or something."

were there for like five minutes."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just make sure if some fuckup
asks you a question, that you tell them they fired first. So, Freeport doctrine
and whatever is irrelevant in case that's used."

smashing the corvettes."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So much for it being a single
rogue ship not going along with the pact with the mutuality."
[Tactical Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Ather, has any effort been
made to track down the bolt thrower line? I would figure tracking bolt
ammunition would be relatively easy since it's only available at one place, that
might illuminate where they get their supply."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We've had unconfirmed rumors
that Kelsey has a shipyard somewhere. So, he can probably manufacture his own
stock of disabling and disarming bolts now."
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its
many tendrils.
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The AEU government would never
let them land on Hyperion to get stocks of bolts. We've made sure with the
government that AEU borders, most spcifically our more higher-end security
sectors will go on instant alert if any pirate goes in."

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

coffee table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small

read letter
--
Hi Shule and Lily, I hope you're both doing okay.
I'm sending you both this exact letter, in case one of you is around, and the
other isn't, so that you see it.
Firstly, my thanks go to you both, yet again, for doing your best for 777. I
know that people are making your efforts difficult, but when you want to scream,
try and remember those of us who appreciate your efforts like me, and Damien. We
admire the stubborn way you just will not let up.
Second, since I have noticed either of you have been around to work much fo
late, and I believe you mentioned it as well, I wanted to extend an offer of
help to you, with anything you like, be it building stations, or double checking
that felo are fed.
I know what it's like when you can't work much, so my support is here, should
you wish it.
You know I am not one of the drama kinds of people, and proudly call you both
friends, so if there's anything I can do, no matter how small or large, please
don't hesitate to ask me.
And lastly, I would be super happy, if you could let me know where in all the
planets you found that amazing corn, and those ribs that you had on Johann's
trip. They were just sensational, and I want to find them.
But most of all, please take care, and I gotta admit, I miss you both. It's
always nice when you're around.
Be safe,
Evenia.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is

straight white claws visible. A white, Bari nose sits below a pair of clear blue
eyes with vertical pupils. It appears to be sleeping.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
