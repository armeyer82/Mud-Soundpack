Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container,
and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container,
and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a
chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
-lily Where are we going?
You say to Lily Kaise, "Where are we going?"
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that
bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed
with bright white floodlights.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored
in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation
order is entered."

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small

tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "I can hear the water running under the
bridge from here its so quiet in here."
Eli clears his throat loudly.
Kim stands to address everyone in the room, glancing at everyone individually
for a brief moment while she speaks: "Good evening, fellow pilots and Mr.
Lambeth. Welcome to this meeting. I am glad you have all taken some time to come
together and discuss some important business. At the start of this liaison term
I intended to hold a meeting, intended to generally discuss the state of the
corps. Vernos then came to me with a proposal which I also intended to discuss,
and that we might get to today if time permits. Then a lot of us got invited for
an expedition, so the meeting was postponed.
nod
You nod.
Kim takes a breath, then continues her speech: "However, after the return of the
expedition, and upon reading some of the news, several pilots expressed concerns
to me about where the AEU is headed, and requested that some time in this
meeting would be devoted to discuss those concerns. Considering how important
this is, I suggest we begin there.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey slumps in an ergonomically designed silver mesh
chair and goes to sleep.
Andrew waves his hat to fan Vernos.

pressing issue."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "You may, since
you were one of the people writing to me."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey suddenly awakens.
Ather turns to Andrew and says, "I've had the opportunity to hear a lot of
concerns from AEU pilots regarding fears that the AEU might be considering
leaving the Accord."
Ather raises a hand as he continues.
Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "These concerns were especially magnified, if you
were, when President Best recalled our current Accord Liaison to New Earth for a
debrief."
Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "The pilots who discussed this all seemed to be in
agreement that we, the AEU civilian pilot Corps submit a joint statement to the
government stating that this action is an inadvisable one, owing to the fact
that the Outsiders, the IFS and even the allied pirates are still a considerable
threat."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods. "You could not have taken a better point
to start."
Lily Kaise nods.

Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Ah... weeeelp, Ah'm not privy to the inner
discussions of the, er, administration, but Ah do know President Best has felt
fer some time the th' Accord is a drain on fundin' whichfor he believes he can
find a better use."
Lily glances down.

Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "My personal opinion is, that the AEU
leaving the accord is not just a poor choice, but a dangerous mistake. First of
all, because events not too long ago have proven that we will only survive
against our common enemies if we stand together. It also sends a very disturbing
sign to the other alliances. A sign which we AEU pilots apparently have sent all
too often, namely, we don't need the rest of you and we can manage alone just
fine."
Eli nods in agreement with Kim.
Lily agrees.
Constantine Stone says, "I agree with that."
: nods in agreement.
Shule nods in agreement.
Eli Grey says, "I firmly believe that, if not for the Accord, we'd all have been
killed a long time ago."

Eli Grey says, "Not for a lack of AEU strength, but rather the strenghth that
unity itself offers."
'precisely.
You say, "Precisely."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "I fear if we pull from the accord and we
get a major invasion force that if advised by their alliances that we could not
recieve any assistance."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Ah surely cain't promise a single thing but
Ah can tell y'all thet this is exactly th' sorta thing yer non-bindin'
resolutions are made fer. One o' those would send a message to th'
administration, Ah'm sure. Whether it'll sway their feelin's at this late date
Ah couldn't tell you."
Lily Kaise says, "And that we are willing to work cooperatively with others as
we may need their assistance at some point and trust me, I believe we may."

Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I do understand the AEU has only so many
credits to spend, and president Best of course has a lot of choices to make, not
an easy position. But this is not a matter of preference. This is not about
luxury we are talking here, but survival of all of humanity."
Constantine Stone says, "If I can add this."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Constantine Stone.

You nod to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders. "Most certainly."
Constantine Stone says, "Maybe to frame the discussion in a way that the
administration understands most clearly."
Constantine Stone says, "I do a ton of work with the accord."
Constantine Stone says, "We all do."
Constantine glances around the table.

You nod to Constantine Stone.
Constantine Stone says, "I think this gets me licenses to do more profitable
work for the AEU faster, and in turn makes me a better asset."
Lily Kaise nods and smiles at Constantine Stone.
Constantine Stone says, "I think our relationship with the accord can bear some
really great fruit, if we just let it be."
nod constant 'I agree.
You nod to Constantine Stone. "I agree."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Mr. Lambeth just mentioned a non binding
resolution, which, if I remember right, means I put up a proposal on this voting
machine, and we vote?"
Lily Kaise says, "I doubt it would fail."
Constantine Stone nods.
nod
You nod.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth nods.
Lily Kaise says, "I'd just prefer that we go forward with a resolution."
Lily Kaise says, "Or at least a statement."
Eli Grey says, "Perhaps to offset the issue of funding, we could all make it a
point to bring more resources directly to AEU worlds. I know some pilots may not
be very happy about this idea, because it would mean losing out on a bit from
always transferring to temp stations and so forth, but it would allow the AEU to
get more of a share of those resources, if my understanding on the matter is
correct."
'Sounds like this is a good opportunity to use a non-binding resolution.
You say, "Sounds like this is a good opportunity to use a non-binding
resolution."
Constantine says to Eli, "I think this is a great suggestion."
Lily Kaise says, "WEll I wouldn't mind contributing a set aside percentage of my
work to augment the AEU but I don't want to defray from temporary stations."
Lily Kaise says, "In other words, I'd contribute personally."
Vernos says to Andrew, "I have a question."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods. "This is something every single pilot can
easily take to heart."
Eli Grey says, "I certainly don't mind forgoing some of my tax cuts from a temp
station activities, if ti means we don't have to pull out of hte Accord."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey. "Go
ahead."
Vernos says to Andrew, "Did I hear correctly over the public address what is
this nine years later that the spaceport is still only offering basic functions
and emergency power?"
Eli Grey says, "I believe the announcement actually syas that it's operating at
limited capacity."
Lily Kaise nods.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey asks, "Is that a problem to anyone else in this
room?"
nod
You nod.
Constantine Stone says, "It's all I've known, but it doesn't sound great."
Constantine Stone says, "And I think it probably doesn't make us look good."
Kim looks slightly surprised as she asks: "A little off topic maybe, but yeah,
after 9 years you'd think the spaceport should not still be functioning in such
a state.
Lily Kaise says, "As well as it seems that a lot of work hasn't been completed."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "President Best feels that President Garner
failed to do enough to improve infrastructure all around. Ah'm sure he plans to
make it a priority his own self."
Lily Kaise nods. "That is very good to hear."
nod
You nod.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "On top of the proposal I mentioned to Kim,
I'd like to use this donation box over here and change it from an expedition
fund to the pilots giving back to the planet by donating funds to fix issues
like this."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Honestly it helps the planet and makes us
look better too."
Eli Grey says, "The telex spaceport did get fully replaced, so there has been
some progress made, but yes it would be nice to see more of it on our capital
planet."
Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I think that money was spent already, no!"
nod eli
You nod to Eli Grey.
Constantine says to Vernos, "I like that idea, though I have no notion of how
important the box has been to expeditions."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Repurposing this box has been discussed
before, but we still need to first learn whether that is possible, and what has
happened with the funds from it."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
Lily says to Vernos, "Yes I never knew that the donations box was earmarked for
Expeditions per se."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "And sorry it was a bit off topic but it has
been bothering me."
Kim says to Andrew, "During our last meeting, november last year, we talked
about this and you said you were going to try and find out more information for
us, do you have any updates on this donation box?"
Eli Grey says, "It was supposed to be an expidition to survey an asteroid
cluster for a new processor, but I believe the whoel thing got tied up when the
Fringe claimed the cluster was too close to their space."
Lily says to Andrew, "Mr. Ambeth if I might ask? Would it be possible to be
provided with an estimate of how much the aEU contributes to the Accord? I'm
just curious as to how it does affect our overall economy?"
Kim says to Eli, "Oh, thanks, I was not aware of that."
Vernos says to Eli, "Honestly we should just work on trying to completely clear
out Frontier if possible."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Can we please keep this slightly
structured and give Mr. Lambeth a chance to answer our questions before we
bombard him with new ones?"
Constantine Stone nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Sorry the question was bothering me."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Ah know a sizable portion of th' budget is
goin' to th' Accord but Ah don't have an exact number. Ah know a new budget is
being discussed as we speak."
Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Lily Kaise says, "Thanks sir."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "If finances are the biggest concern with
the AEU's participation in the Accord, I would not feel bad about contributing a
percentage of what I earn to the accord, much like how I contribute to my
organization or insurance. How do you guys feel about that?"
Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
'I'd be fine with that.
You say, "I'd be fine with that."
Constantine says to Kim, "I think that's a great compromise and I would be happy
to do it."
Lily Kaise says, "I absolutely support as I made this recommendation earlier."
Constantine Stone nods.
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Eli Grey says, "I would do something like that, or even just an overall tax
increase by the AEU. Again,  probably not ap popular idea."
Lily Kaise says, "Perhaps as pilots we shouldn't be as heavily subsidized to
offset some of this as well."
Eli Grey says, "Perhaps a grace period for newer pilots so they can get on their
feet, but us veteran pilots shouldn't have a problem paying a bit more taxes, or
contributing directly to the Accord."
Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I can put a proposal about that on the
voting machine as well."
nod kim 'That would be great.
You nod to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders. "That would be great."
Andrew scratches his head. "Yes... Ah reckon a proposal would be the first step
toward any o' that."
Ather frowns slightly, shrugging.
Lily Kaise looks at Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa thoughtfully.
Eli says to Ather, "I know, it's not the most desirable idea, tax increases
rarely are."
Constantine Stone says, "The only thing I would caution is that any agreement of
this kind should have some kind of end or renegotiation date."
Constantine Stone says, "Just a thought."
Kim nods 'Have we anything else to add to this topic about the..."then stops,
noticing Ather shrugging.
Kim says to Ather, "Was there anything on your mind?"
Ather gestures wordlessly for Kim to continue.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "I think we can move on from this
particular matter then?"
Constantine Stone nods.
nod
You nod.
Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
Eli Grey says, "It sounds ike we're mostly all in agreement, not on the
solutions perhaps, but at least on the primary issue."
Lily Kaise nods.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
received 171,534.73 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating
Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Another matter that several pilots
expressed concerns to me about was, all the things about the AEU in the news
lately. Particularly scientist Peter Feinstein renouncing his citizenship to the
AEU, the matter of this other gentleman, his name currently escapes me, one day
being inducted into the EAOS and the next time leaving again."
Lily Kaise sighs.
Lily Kaise says, "A huge loss for us."
Constantine Stone nods to Lily Kaise.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Mmmm hmmmm. What y'all gotta unnerstand
is... well, recall thet th' pilot corps voted unanimously for President Best. He
figures he got a mandate. If'n y'all wanna try to correct thet notion... well,
time's runnin' real short."
Eli Grey nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
nod andrew
You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey asks, "Sending that message is another thing for
the voting machine, I guess?"
Kim looks around the table at her fellow pilots: "I guess we have work to do.
But, how? I think Ather suggested writing up a joint statement for President
Best? How would you feel about that, or do you have another angle at this?"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
Constantine Stone says, "I think it would be good if that came from Ather."
Eli Grey says, "I fear that the discconection from the EAOS, and the formation
of the Ministry of facts are well intentioned decisions. I fear though that it
will eventually lead to us perhaps being a bit behind with scientific
discoveries. Currently the other alliances are allowing their scientists to work
together and thus share their results through that process. If we cut ourselves
off from that, we're limiting the potential of our own scientists."
Constantine Stone nods to Eli Grey.
nod eli
You nod to Eli Grey.
Lily nods in agreement with Eli.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders smiles at Eli Grey. "Nicely said."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "President Best feels the AEU don't get
anythin' in return fer sendin' folks off to th' EAOS."
Constantine Stone says, "I think he's wrong about that."
Constantine Stone says, "With all due respect."
Constantine Stone says, "For one thing, the AEU gets glory when AEU-born
scientists participate in making discoveries."
Constantine Stone says, "And the EAOS is where that's happening, currently."
Lily Kaise nods.
"So, we would need to work out what the AEU has gained in recent past from our
scientists working with the EAOS, so we can make a case?" Voice of the Corps Kim
Saunders frowns.
Constantine says to Kim, "That sounds like a good place to start."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "President Best feels thet he needs to stop
the er, what is it there, the 'brain drain' so thet some o' these discoveries
can start happenin' in th' Union."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I mean, not just some statement, but
facts that can back it up."
Eli Grey says, "Man of our ships our equipped with EAOS lasers, sensors, and
sometimes even hull plating."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Folks can bring these discoveries back to
the union."
Constantine Stone says, "And I think that might make sense to someone looking at
academia from the outside."
Constantine Stone says, "But most huge discoveries are made cooperatively."
Constantine Stone says, "On our own we could never keep pace, simply because
there are fewer of us."
Lily says to Andrew, "With all due respect we bring discoveries and credit to
our pilits as well as we earn funds which aid the economy."
Eli Grey coughs. "Many,  I mean."
Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of sweet and creamy coffee.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Let's remember, Mr. Lambeth is only
stating what President Best has stated before. That does not indicate whether or
not he agrees with it."
Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
Lily Kaise says, "We are Kim. Just stating our own points of view."
Eli Grey says, "It's not Mister Lambeth we really need to sway."
Constantine Stone nods.
Lily Kaise says, "Well he will have heard us at least and can share our
sentaments."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "So, rift drives, sensors, hull plating,
those are things we pilots and possibly the navy see some benifit too. It would
be good if we could also find some things scientists working with the EAOS have
achieved that helps the average citizen."
nod kim
You nod to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
Constantine Stone nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
Eli Grey says, "I don't believe that currently Best has much interest in rift
drives, I could certainly be wrong."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods to Eli Grey. "You are probably right."
Lily Kaise says, "Our earned income through EAOS-based work. Tesla for one."
Andrew spreads his hands. "Ah ain't tryin' ta argue, just tryin' ta... liaise...
and give y'all the government's feelin's on it all. Ah say again, y'all voted
fer him, those o' ya in th' corps at th' time. An' there's been several terms
since he took office. Time is real short if ya wanna try ta git him to not do
what he always promised ta do, is all's Ah can really tell y'all."
Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Lily Kaise says, "I just know that most of us didn't consider that he would be
this severe."
Kim looks thoughtful: "I am drawing a blank here. But Mr. Lambeth is right. We
have little time to set this straight."
Constantine Stone says, "Well, it at least sounds like we're mostly united here,
so we can at least be hopeful."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Well I have an example that might lead into
my proposal Kim."
Lily Kaise says, "Let's please stay on point."
Eli says to Kim, "Thankfully if most of the folks here vote ontight, it won't
have to sit in the box long. You can close the vote quickly once we all vote."
Lily Kaise nods.
nod
You nod.
Vernos says to Lily, "My example was quite on topic thank you."
Lily Kaise shrugs.
Kim says to Vernos, "Ok, go ahead, what is your example?"
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Well think of it this way, if we say had an
alliance with the fringe, and we send scienists to work with their scientists
well, we get that information and are then able to apply it here with our Worlds
and even our own ships. So having scientists working outside of the union can be
quite useful to the union as well."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Scientists working together is how stuff
gets done and honestly the union is important but the union wouldnt exist
without science and the EAOS is a huge part of that."
Andrew scratches his nose. "Well, ta be fair, it'd be those scientists becomin'
Fringe citizens instead o' jest workin' with 'em. Thet's what th' EAOS does."
Eli Grey says, "Oh, I thought that up until last week, Feinstein was still
considered an AEU citizen, and other AEU scientists as well."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "He had shared citizenship the way I
understood it."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "So a citizen of both."
Eli Grey says, "I'll admit, I don't nkow exactly how it all works, but I always
thought that wehn they were inducted into the EAOS, still maintained their home
alliance citizenship."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Fienstein was somethin' of a patriot fer
most of his career. He indeed worked fer th' EAOS but kept his home here, so ta
speak. But no more. And thet ain't th' norm."
Kim glances at the room, a thoughtful expression on her face: "Yeah, if we had
an alliance with... if is the issue. We do not have such an alliance, yet. And
something tells me President Best needs to hear something more exact from us to
change his direction than something that may happen, if both us and the other
alliance can get an agreement."
Lily Kaise nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
Eli Grey says, "The EAOS doesn't do alliances. They remjain neutral."
Eli Grey says, "Er. Remain."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Yeah."
Kim says to Vernos, "Don't get me wrong, if I had anything to say about it, we
would still have full alliances with the League and the Fringe, which, of their
own choosing AEU pilots before my time decided to give up."
Lily Kaise nods.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey nods to Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders.
Vernos says to Kim, "It might be time to consider the negitive impact of that
descision and outreach ourselves a bit."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Maybe not an alliance but to let folks know
that hey we arent just here to isolate ourselves."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I'd love nothing else than to have better
relations with the other alliances, including the Mutuality. As I said before,
we only have a chance to survive against the outsiders when we are united."
Lily Kaise says, "At any rate new pilots especially will lose a lot if say we no
longer have access to Space Vermin or Tesla and GMG and elseqhere."
Lily Kaise says, "'anywhere where the EAOS are sponsors."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Ah believe President Best's thought is thet,
if'n th' Union does leave th' Accord or rejects EAOS inductions, they can
negotiate fer access to those sites."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Question is, what if the EAOS says no."
'Or the Accord for that matter.
You say, "Or the Accord for that matter."
Lily Kaise says, "And we'd be heavily taxed and bring less income into the
alliance."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Andrew looks down at his hat and says nothing.
Lily Kaise says, "I'd rather that we paid the taxes to AEU and not to another
entity for the use of their resources."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "If I consider I can currently easily earn
a billion credits in a week if I put in a bit of effort, I am really not so
concerned about that. I am concerned about this alliance as a whole, not just
our pilots, become more isolationist than it already is."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Guys, Mr. Lambeth has told us we need to
take action and I think we might be making his life harder currently."
Lily Kaise says, "Well that's the point of not breaking off from the Accord."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I am willing to take action. Right now. I
am racking my brain to figure out how though."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Not harder. Jest thet Ah'm not here ta
represent mah personal views an' feelin's an' arguin' with me don't have much
purpose."
Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Look. Right now, we're only talking about what is
going to happen if we don't act. We're stating the problems, but no one is
trying to suggest ways of solving those problems very well."
-kim I thought it had been proposed for us to draft a joint statement?
You say to Kim, "I thought it had been proposed for us to draft a joint
statement?"
Lily Kaise nods to you.
Lily Kaise says, "I believe this is what Mr. Lambeth needs."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "We could, in addition, to the polls, come
up with a statement that Mr. Lambeth could present to the government on our
behalf. That is not a bad idea, and Shule is right, it has been suggested."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "With polls, I mean, proposals for non
binding resolutions."
'ok, so what exactly is going to go into the non-binding resolution?
You ask, "Ok, so what exactly is going to go into the non-binding resolution?"
Andrew straightens up, his voice raising. "Ah don't need nothin'. Y'all voted
Best in and yer gettin' what ya voted fer, if ya wanna change it now..." He
sighs and lowers his voice. "If ya wanna change it now, ya cain't take any
half-measures or drag yer feet. Ya gotta act."

You say, "I thought the nonbinding resolution was to express our concern that

Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "We also need to respectfully and vocally
send a message that he does not have a mandate."
'so, in adition to that nonbinding resolution, do we wantt o craft a joint
statement?
You ask, "So, in adition to that nonbinding resolution, do we wantt o craft a
joint statement?"
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Might be a good idea."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders asks, "Ather is right though. We all know what
the problems are. We can talk about it for a few hours, we can write something
up, but what can we do to actually convince our president to stop pulling the
AEU into a hole it will not recover from?"
Lily Kaise says, "Well this is a start."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "He does have a mandate. He has th' pilot
vote, that's a matter o' public record. An' th' Napas have control of th' entire
government. Ya gotta work within thet reality."
Lily Kaise says, "We can't solve all of the AEU's problems in this meeting."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Well Ryo jokingly suggested a strike but
that is a bit extreme."
Lily Kaise nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "A strike? But y'all don't even have a
baseball team. Not sure what yer talkin' about."
Lily sriffals a laugh.
Vernos says to Andrew, "I think a plot was upset with the news and suggested
something extreme."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "I don't suppose not working for a day, a
week, a month or even a year does anything to change president Best plans for
the AEU."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "Pilot I mean."
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "Make that, I don't believe."
Lily Kaise says, "I'm sure if we took such action, we'd kiss our licenses
goodby. We're still sponsored by a government who would like to see us on our
way i'm sure."
Andrew rubs his ears and glances at the ceiling. "Hmm, th' acoustics in here..."
Vernos says to Kim, "I agree."
Lily Kaise says, "Oops I mis-spoke goodbye sir."
Lily Kaise grins.
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "We have a starting point."
Industrial Whip Vernos Bailey says, "We all mostly agree on that starting
point."
-kim Aside from drafting that nonbinding resolution, I'm not sure what else we
can do to make our voice heard regarding the topic of the AEU withdrawing from
the Accord. 
You say to Kim, "Aside from drafting that nonbinding resolution, I'm not sure
what else we can do to make our voice heard regarding the topic of the AEU
withdrawing from the Accord."
'And also drafting that joint statement.
You say, "And also drafting that joint statement."
Lily Kaise nods.
Ather shakes his head slightly, glancing around the room, his optics unit
dimming slightly and taking on a slight redish hew as he silently presses a
finger to his lips.
Eli says to Andrew, "What kinds of things can we do in our everyday activites,
to help take some strain off the funding issues? Will doing more for our
homeworlds, like transfering salvage direclty to them, make a difference?"
Eli Grey coughs. "Activites I mean."
Eli Grey shakes his head as if to himself.
Eli Grey says, "Activites."
"But we all heard Mr. Lambeth." Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders nods. "We, or at
least those of us who voted at the time, gave our support to Mr. Best to do the
things he intended to do if he were elected."
Eli Grey says, "Activities, yeesh, I think my tongue is asleep."
Kim says to Ather, "Did you wanna say something, if so, feel free."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Naw, transferrin' more or transferrin' to
different places ain't th' kinda thing that'll hit President Best's desk."
Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Too much is being said. Some of which should not
be said."
Eli Grey snaps his fingers.
Ather looks meaningfully around the room.
Eli Grey says, "Definintely no more striek talk. Too many folks depend on the
resources we bring in."
Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Mmm hmmm, starvin' children need thet
unprocessed ore"
Eli Grey grins at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Eli Grey says, "Perhaps my logic is flaws. I only meant that resoruces need
folks to u se them, and that means jobs."
Eli Grey says, "I apologize, I'm getting anxious and it's making me trip over my
own words."
Andrew simply shakes his head.
Lily Kaise says, "Well workers are employed there and yes the end product is
hopefully sold off or used in production which yields income to our government."
Ather rubs his forehead.
Eli Grey says, "At any rate, I still don't think a strike is a viable option,
and it's not very proactive."

Eli looks at Ather with surprise and confusion.
Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders says, "If this is really what people want we can
draft up a statement, but it's really only more words and I doubt it makes any
difference."
Eli clears his throat and looks down at the floor.
Andrew pushes a fingertip into his ear and wiggles it around.
Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth and absently bobs
his head up and down like a space parakeet.

Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders smiles at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth. "Must be
tiring sometimes."

to come to a meeting just to have to remind us that we have a voting machine."

Eli Grey grins at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "In fact, I want to even take a walk and clear

Andrew nods and gets to his feet, plopping his hat back onto his head. "Happy ta
attend. Sorry 'bout th' acoustics in here. Hard ta have a productive meetin' in
here sometimes. But good luck to y'all."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
