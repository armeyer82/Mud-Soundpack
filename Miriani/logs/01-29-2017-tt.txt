Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small hot tea dispenser, and a soft
periwinkle cashmere blanket here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

#SNOOPING SESSION 'StarConquest'
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Ather, does that bolt
thrower dampen?"
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives
a new notice.
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The bolt cannot dampen."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You cannot install a sensor
dampener on any corporation vessel. Just like you can't install charged shot on
them etc."
[AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Temporary
Station at Home Beacon Alpha 286 is now on emergency power.
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Melinda, did Akemi tell you my
suggestion for the basic defense platforms to set up at accord, Orion and
Teslaworld?"
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "No."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "My proposal is the most basic
short-range laser, basic energy shunt, fusion battery and core. Should be just
enough units of power, and the stations will stay operational for a good long
while."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "That makes sense."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "For this initiative, I will be
happy to offer the fusion batteries on behalf of invaders at no charge."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "All right."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Let me know when you station
builders are ready to put those stations together, and I'll arrange the purchase
of the batteries."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Will do."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I figure, if we get one person
onto those defense platforms, and we manage to lure the bolts close enough even
for a few potshots, we'll have something better than nothing. If they can hit
with long-range weapons, we should do so as well."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I agree."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Question, Ather?"
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Accord has pretty heavy
sector defenses, doesn't it?"
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's only beta 3."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I've honestl ynever seen them
fire any space-based weaponry. I mean, I suppose the peacekeepers will respond
in force, though."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure looks like an Alpha 1
sector when you enter. Between the station and the constant launch of
peacekeepers...that's why I was wondering."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It really does."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean, I know the
designation isn't Alpha-1, but it sure looks like it would be."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You'd also think they'd have
access to space baced weaponry."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It is a fortress, tis true. I
mean, I suppose we can cut the accord out of the defense platforms, and just
build them at Orion and Teslaworld."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "With as long as we've had
those flight control scanners up, what, a couple weeks now? Nothing has touched
Accord, but they've loved the other three. Rats don't even go in there."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm also surprised the accord
doesn't have it's own flight control relays."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, but it's still good to
maintain a flight control tower at Accord, since IFS and Outsiders use to love
invading it before."
01:00:00
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not advocating against it,
just curious...when was the last time they messed with Accord?"
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Pirates, not for a good long
while. IFS and Outsiders, probably been a year or so, maybe a bit more."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "In the scheme of things,
that's not very long."
[Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "They could just be waiting for
us to let our guard down."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Especially since IFS generally
tend to launch surprise attacks literally out of nowhere."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How did we find out about it
before? Flight control?"
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, before the accord would
either generally request assistance. Kaito and I use to also patrol it regularly
with disposable vessels. That was when there'd be like, one major IFS attack a
day, at least."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Gotcha."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Pirate in orion."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Scout."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then they launched a massive
multi-pronged assault against us hitting several alliance sectors, plus the
Accord, bringing forward assault stations to several locations. That started to
push them back a bit. Then they launched another massive multi-pronged attack
agains tthe Mutuality which we also beat back with major losses. That seemed to
make them hesitate even more. Since then, they've launched a few small invasions
against us, but nothing as big as those ones."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Actually it's a destroyer."
[Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Man, wow."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Headed for the watchtower."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Maybe I can get shots in."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Headed for the watchtower?"
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The long range laser is there,
no?"
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So I'm going there."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes."
[Tactical Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "On the way in a fighter."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Just the one ship?"
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And it ran."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. It left."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I got 3 shots in."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rat scared it off."
[Tactical Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "It saw me."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Two for morningstar
beacons?"
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Sure."
[Tactical Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "Me."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Me."
[Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Sure."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Or I can wait."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Full with Lillian and
Rat."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Cruiser beacons instead?"
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Xenological Debris-Burning Temporary
Station from the two-person light transport "The Ship's Name". The organization
has earned 484,565.71 credits.
[Tactical Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "No."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I thought I'd ask."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Rat and I are in the
lounge."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "This is one of those times
when I'd honestly encourage most of you to practice flying decoy beacon drops in
a fighter. So, let the waspers go on theirs, you go on your own so you can
practice."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'll do that then."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Fighter very highs are the
thing."
[Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "True, I'll get started on
taht."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Agreed, that's why I want
to do Morningstar. They are quite helpful in these pirate fights."
[Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "That, too."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Uh, I don't recommend that you
do a very high decoy beacon drop until you are actually confident enough on the
highs first. By confident I mean that you only get hit like once or twice at the
most."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yeah, I wasn't planning to."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Aww, taking the fun out of
it."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One
performance goal down! One to go!"
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I did a very high with
little issues. So I did another and nearly got my ass kicked. Therefore, I agree
with Ather here. Very High beacons can be rough."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yo uget them bolts!"
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in General/Name Changes.
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a
new notice.
[Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Chetumal Orbit is on
alert."
[Tactical Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "It was a test."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Checking it now."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "OK. Who is not in a
beacon....a test?"
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "What?"
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We'll be there as soon as
we can."
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "What test?"
[Tactical Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "It was only a test, ignore it, I
hit the wrong button."
[Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "It's standing down now."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Copy that."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Copy."
[Tactical Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "Sorry, stop."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Please elaborate so we can
tell you to never do that again."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What'd you do."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think she must have mashed
the SOS button...I'm thinking."
[Tactical Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "I hit the wrong button, what else
can I say."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, they launched cruisers
and gunships for that alert. Good fuck."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh well, all's well."
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Well, glory to the fleet."
[Tactical Communication] Sarah Lyn transmits, "Yo yo yo, shiting jesus, sorry, I
hit the wrong button, o, fuck, dammit son of a bitch."
[AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Temporary
Station at Home Beacon Alpha 286 is shutting down.
Lily Kaise yawns.
Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped

large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made

Lily Kaise glides out.
02:00:00
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Excellent
work on our first performance goal! Let's go for the second!"
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Three for defense on the
morningstar for an op?"
[Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll engineer it."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Two."
[Tactical Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "Salvage operation?"
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Yes."
[Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Yes."
[Tactical Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "How long does this
take?"
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "It shouldn't take longer
than an hour."
[Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Is there l."
[Tactical Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "I will do it."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "One."
[Tactical Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Buttons, my bad."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "One more for defense?"
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Old Earth by the way."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I said I would Lillian..."
[Tactical Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "I figured. Just
landed."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Full."

[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's been happening
lately."
[Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "They haven't been of late."
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Pardon?"
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, I was monitoring flight
control at second battle, and jumped into the drift funnel so that I could help
out when enemy vessels jumped in, but no enemy ships engaged after whoever was
in that league fighter shot at the transport."
[Tactical Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "They recognized my ship name
and decided against it."
[Tactical Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "Ather, did you wish to
talk to me?"
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh yes. Come to New Earth."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small hot tea dispenser, a soft
periwinkle cashmere blanket, and Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it
has unread notices.

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Attention pilots: after further
discussion with other pilots, it seems that sensor dampeners are especially
effective in the battle against Mr. Kelsey's latest attack fleet compositions
that include bolt throwers. As of the time of this comm notice, we have had
three strikes by his fleet of bolt throwers and other assorted vessels. In
future attacks, if any active pilot has a vessel that can get a sensor dampener
installed on it, waste no time in getting it. You can usually install them on
vessels such as the combat scout, the flare, the escort, the clipper, the
gunship, the pulsar, the heavy fighter which has no FTL drive and the cruiser.
I'm sure that there are other ships that I haven't yet thought about. The
electronic warfare fighters at Hyperion come with sensor dampeners installed,
but have no FTL's like the heavy fighter, so it's not very easy to transport one
into a hot zone. If you have any questions, now is not the time for hesitation.
Send me letters, call the SDC office, ask on alliance or tactical comms. [23:48
