["Enchanted Chaos" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a emerald green light throughout the room. You see a small flat disc containing the image of Desolo Island; Beach hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see an internal stun turret, a chic royal blue suede sofa with reclining seats, a chic black marble Coffee table decorated with a miniature suit of armor, a tall floor lamp with a spiraling black clay base and a thin red shade, a chic dark red suede king's throne with a tiny golden phoenix perched on the back, a floating marble and glass bar, a black architectural design simulator, a snow white Persian cat, a royal blue diving air compressor, a Santa hat, Karina the droid, Mazer the droid, a golden retriever puppy, William the Squirebot, and a majestic gold stallion here.

00:47 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:47 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

00:47 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

00:47 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:47 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

00:47 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

00:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:47 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

00:48 #$#soundpack_pong

00:48 The ship is already moving.

00:48 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:48 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:48 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:48 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:48 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:48 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:48 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

00:48 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:48 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:48 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:48 (Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Living Room) (Railed Porch) A fuzzy sanitation drone arrives.

00:48 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

00:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

00:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:48 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:48 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer.

Player-owned Space Stations, Moons, and Planets
--------------------------------------------------
PLANETS, MOONS, AND SPACESTATIONS:
Q: What do I need to get a planet, moon, or spacestation?
A: For spacestations, you need 10 billion credits and 10000 points. For moons, you need 20 billion credits and 15000 points. For planets, you need 30 billion credits and 25000 points. You also pay additional fees for each room you add.
Q: Where can I put my spacestation, planet, or moon?
A: In any sector, including places out of local space, except sector 24, sector 15, sector 12, sector 9, sector 13, sector 19, sector 0, sector 30, sector 115, sector 14 and sector 32. These sectors are subject to change and can be added to at any time.
Q: What can these fine places have?!
A: They can have an optional pool, an optional hot tub, and an optional private garage. You also may have a security center which allows you to control flight control and monitor rooms on the station, planet, or moon. You can also have a room that monitors the sector around your station, planet, or moon. Additionally, you're allowed to have five custom item stores for a station, seven custom item stores for a moon, and nine custom item stores for a planet. Any additional stores will have to be a tradesman item. Custom item stores are defined as stores with special clothing, food or other collectable items. You may have a transport pod as long as the station, planet, or moon is not out of local space. Player-owned space stations, planets, and moons cannot contain facilities that allow for point transfers to take place, including artifact research centers, passenger transport facilities, etc. Stations, planets and moons cannot be self-contained. This means you cannot design a station that eliminates your need to travel to other planets to obtain specific services or goods. Example: starship registries.
Q: Can my station be armed?!?!
A: Sorry, no.
Q: Can I keep people out of my station, planet, or moon?
A: You can control flight control which will deny docking to a whole alliance, everybody but owners and caretakers, or specific ships based on your choice. If landing is disabled to all, even the ITPN station becomes non-functional.
Q: ITPN Stations??! Oh my oh my! What do they entail?!
A: All private space stations, moons and planets are required to have an ITPN station on them. These stations cannot be past a security checkpoint, meaning that everybody has to be able to get to them. ITPN stations may have only a single destination. The destination is determined by the sector that your private space station, moon or planet is in. If there is already a planet, moon or station in the sector you are building in, your ITPN destination goes to that location. Otherwise, the ITPN pod will go to the sector hub. That's Pax for sectors 1 through 20, and the ITPN hub in sector 33 for sec
02:20 tors 21 through 40. An example would be if a person build a moon in sector 31. There is a planet there with an ITPN station already, so the one on the private moon would go to that planet, which would then go to the hub. Private space stations, moons and planets not in a numbered sector can not have an ITPN station.

--------------------------------------------------
PLANETS, MOONS, AND SPACESTATIONS:
Q: What do I need to get a planet, moon, or spacestation?
A: For spacestations, you need 10 billion credits and 10000 points. For moons, you need 20 billion credits and 15000 points. For planets, you need 30 billion credits and 25000 points. You also pay additional fees for each room you add.
Q: Where can I put my spacestation, planet, or moon?
A: In any sector, including places out of local space, except sector 24, sector 15, sector 12, sector 9, sector 13, sector 19, sector 0, sector 30, sector 115, sector 14 and sector 32. These sectors are subject to change and can be added to at any time.
Q: What can these fine places have?!
A: They can have an optional pool, an optional hot tub, and an optional private garage. You also may have a security center which allows you to control flight control and monitor rooms on the station, planet, or moon. You can also have a room that monitors the sector around your station, planet, or moon. Additionally, you're allowed to have five custom item stores for a station, seven custom item stores for a moon, and nine custom item stores for a planet. Any additional stores will have to be a tradesman item. Custom item stores are defined as stores with special clothing, food or other collectable items. You may have a transport pod as long as the station, planet, or moon is not out of local space. Player-owned space stations, planets, and moons cannot contain facilities that allow for point transfers to take place, including artifact research centers, passenger transport facilities, etc. Stations, planets and moons cannot be self-contained. This means you cannot design a station that eliminates your need to travel to other planets to obtain specific services or goods. Example: starship registries.
Q: Can my station be armed?!?!
A: Sorry, no.
Q: Can I keep people out of my station, planet, or moon?
A: You can control flight control which will deny docking to a whole alliance, everybody but owners and caretakers, or specific ships based on your choice. If landing is disabled to all, even the ITPN station becomes non-functional.
Q: ITPN Stations??! Oh my oh my! What do they entail?!
A: All private space stations, moons and planets are required to have an ITPN station on them. These stations cannot be past a security checkpoint, meaning that everybody has to be able to get to them. ITPN stations may have only a single destination. The destination is determined by the sector that your private space station, moon or planet is in. If there is already a planet, moon or station in the sector you are building in, your ITPN destination goes to that location. Otherwise, the ITPN pod will go to the sector hub. That's Pax for sectors 1 through 20, and the ITPN hub in sector 33 for sec
04:12 tors 21 through 40. An example would be if a person build a moon in sector 31. There is a planet there with an ITPN station already, so the one on the private moon would go to that planet, which would then go to the hub. Private space stations, moons and planets not in a numbered sector can not have an ITPN station.

The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
She is not wearing a top. For a bottom, she is wearing a deep purple satin and lace g-string embroidered with hundreds of tiny diamonds.

She is also wearing a pink flight control scanner, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a long necklace made of smoothly polished light purple amethyst stones, a handmade ring made of amethyst and multi-colored stones, a cute tortie cat backpack, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a pink armor storage bag

14:45 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

14:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:45 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

14:45 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:45 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

14:45 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

14:45 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

14:45 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

14:45 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

14:45 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

14:45 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:45 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

14:45 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

14:45 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:45 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:45 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

14:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

14:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

14:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

14:46 ["Galactic Rainbow" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white t
20:32 rash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You see Miriam Valleris (dozing) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.

This lithe woman appears to be in her mid-twenties and stands 5 feet and 10 inches tall with a large bust size. Her heart-shaped face bears a dark complexion. Her waist-length, midnight black hair is pulled back in an elegant French twist and tied back with white silk ribbons and dotted with shimmering blue sapphires and diamonds. She has expressive jade green eyes with a snub nose above brilliantly white, straight teeth. Her abdomen is heavily rounded, and her hips seem to have widened considerably. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a faint azure glow.
She has a tattoo of a sapphire blue flaming dragon on her right shoulder.
She has a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her left earlobe and a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with smoky silver eyeshadow. She is wearing light red lip gloss on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted rose red with shimmering silver crystals shaped in to leaves and adorned with entrancing swirls of amethyst and sapphire dust caught beneath a semitransparent topcoat and the nails on her right hand are painted rose red with shimmering silver crystals shaped in to leaves and adorned with entrancing swirls of amethyst an
21:18 d sapphire dust caught beneath a semitransparent topcoat.
For a top, she is wearing a long black satin shawl with a red teardrop shaped clasp over a conservative black cashmere long sleeve blouse with a lace-trimmed collar and three ruby red pearl buttons down the front and a black silk front clasp bra with a black diamond rose-shaped clasp. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of faded blue boot cut jeans with silver studs on the pockets over a black g-string with tiny metallic studs. She is wearing a pair of sexy black leather combat boots over a pair of ribbed black anklet socks on her feet. She is wearing a black leather belt with a rose shaped buckle around her waist. She is also wearing a lovely rose gold ring with "my love" engraved on it, a round gold-trimmed locket on a silver chain, a rose gold signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, an emerald-studded sterling silver digital pocketwatch with a square crystal display, a simple white gold chain with a glowing crystal sphere encrusted with numerous precious gems dangling from it, a black leather purse with an ornate silver rose-shaped clasp, a black leather briefcase, a sparkly black suede diaper bag patterned with lions, a softly padded black snuggly, a light orange padded satin all-purpose sling, a compact silver Lore computer, two black metafrequency communication pins, a black metafrequency earpiece, a black metafrequency communicator, an ammunition storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a gray rolled toolkit, a black armor storage bag, an archaeological artifact storage container, a level one archaeological dig site scanner, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a black spacesuit navigational computer, a black spacesuit jet, a white fuzzy artifact storage container, and a black handheld planetary surveyor.
She is carrying nothing.

Houses
--------------------------------------------------
HOUSES:
Q: What do I need to get a house?
A: Houses are 5000 points and two billion credits up front plus an additional fee (10 million) for each room you add.
Q: Where can a house be located?
A: A house can be located on any planet, moon, or spacestation other than: Acrylon, Angelus, Outreach, Miriani, Pax, Empanda, Aquili, Freistadt, Charon, Venus, Mercury, Pluto, Luna, Earth, Caranza, any of the stations in sector 19, any planet or moon in sector 12, the Jump Hub Station in sector 0, and any player-owned space station or planet unless you have the permission of the station or planet owner. These are subject to change and other places may be added at any time.
Q: What can a house have?!
A: A house will come with a way to boot anyone out of the house, a biometric entrance where you can set the people you want able to come in, an optional pool, an optional hot tub, an optional private garage, and the ability to create the design of the house exactly as you'd like it and describe all the rooms yourself.
Q: How do I get a house?
A: Visit the realtor's office on Aquatimis in sector 10. From the office itself, type REQUEST. Your name will be placed in a queue and somebody will meet with you when time permits to create your house. When requesting your realtor, make sure you have information ready, such as what planet you would like your house on, where on the pla
23:14 net you want it, and what you would like it called.
Q: I don't want my house to be at this location anymore. How can I get it moved?
A: For a fee of 1,000,000,000 credits, you can assist and have your house relocated. This fee is non-negociable. Think of it as having to break up your house into segments and send it by truck across country. Moving houses is a very tedious process, so in order to curb the constant requests to relocate, we had to impose a fee.
*** It is worth noting that if your house is built on a private structure, such as a space station, moon or planet that does not belong to you and the owner of the property denies you access, it is entirely an in character issue. Furthermore, if the property's owner is no longer in the game and another party purchases the property, it is not the responsibility or obligation of the hosts to move your house for you free of charge.

Griswold Opens with a Splash
----------------------------
Parker Halvorson-Driscoll, notable retired Hale pilot and playboy of Commoveo nightlife announced his latest investment venture at a press conference last night held in his Commoveo penthouse. Attended by his latest partner, Mason Danforth of Danforth Steel, the sixty-two-year-old Driscoll sipped scotch and shook hands as he worked the crowd of wealthy entrepreneurs and socialites.
Griswold, a marine class planet located in sector 34 was purchased by Driscoll several years ago from the Hale government. Little was known about the goings on beneath the planet's watery blue surface until just a few days ago. Alliance ship computers were denied access, and Hale officials remained close mouthed when approached for questioning. The secrecy finally came to an end last night as Driscoll took the stage for his big announcement.
"I am proud to present the galaxy's first underwater tourist excursion experience," Driscoll told the assembled crowd. "We have a feeding zoo stocked with a variety of native animals as well as the galaxy's first underwater botanical garden." But tourist attractions aren't the only thing Griswold has to offer. Eager pilots and alliance citizens alike will be able to rent apartment space on the newly opened world. Shopping, dining, and exploration are some of the other amenities Griswold has to offer. "I expect this will be a real windfall," Driscoll
23:40  noted, "sure you have Kentos, but that's more on the research side. Griswold is all about the entertainment."
The ribbon-cutting ceremony will take place on the morning of Saturday, February third in front of a select group of officials. At 11:00 am GST, the landing site will be opened up to alliance pilots. A representative from Griswold Enterprises will be on scene to greet pilots and answer questions. Access for non-pilot alliance citizens will be granted the following day.
