01:32 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors

01:32 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, Estelle the droid, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south and out.

01:33 #$#soundpack_lag 105

01:33 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:33 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

01:33 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

01:33 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

01:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:33 The ship is already moving.

01:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:33 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:33 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:33 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

01:33 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:33 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:33 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:33 Invalid direction.

01:33 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:33 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:33 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:33 The ship is already on autopilot.

01:33 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

01:33 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:34 #$#soundpack_pong

01:34 #$#soundpack_lag 110

01:34 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

01:34 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

01:34 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:34 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:34 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

01:34 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:34 The ship is not moving.

01:34 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

01:34 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20). You may also specify a destination name.

01:34 Current coordinates: 12, 18, 20

01:34 The ship must be in MANUAL mode.

01:34 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

01:34 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:34 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:34 I don't understand that.

01:34 The starship is in manual navigation mode.

01:34 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

01:34 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon.

01:34 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:36 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

01:36 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

01:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:36 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:36 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.

21:44 [Newbie] Rimil Bloch: Someone gave me a really good search pattern for asteroids. Does this work because I am more thoroughly searching a sector or am I actually covering a wider variety of sectors?

21:45 #$#soundpack_pong

21:45 #$#soundpack_lag 102

21:45 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: Its because your covering more sectors.

21:45 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: If you enter a sector it will tell you right away if there's a roid there or not. You do not have to serach.

21:45 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: Search.

You see nothing special. You see a small flat disc containing the image of Santa Claus hanging on the wall.
You see a massive sandstone fireplace with a mosaic tile hearth and a teakwood mantel, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses and a coral ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte gold lamp, a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a translucent architectural design simulator, a shiny purple starship simulator, Maggie the bot, EmmyLou the droid, a compact bright red cooler with zip up compartments along the sides, Jenaia the droid, a parrot, and a medium fuchsia pink toy bunny here.
You can go northwest, northeast, east, and south.

23:15 [Newbie] Moiraine Yobi: I am relatively sure of the answer but if you are in a sector which mgiht be a sector a lot of people go but is technically not a numbered sector, not considered a local sector, and you launch a specialty ship, does that actually count and get the people involved in trouble?

23:15 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: The sector requires flight control I believe.

23:16 #$#soundpack_pong
