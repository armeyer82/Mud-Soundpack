Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a glossy
pale pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather
captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a
hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a
small white trash bin, a small blue insulated cooler, a compact red
refrigerator, a blue plastic food storage container, a small red insulated
cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated purple cooler, Purr
the humanoid service robot, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers
here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

You listen for a moment to the extra long-range NDB pings from The Torus. They
seem extremely loud. The signal strength meter reads: 95%.
Lily hugs you.

"Going for this cluster to get debris," Lily says.
'Ah, ok
You say, "Ah, ok."
Lily says, "I think I was approaching 96 percent on the nDB but lost that
orientation."
'Awww

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no
atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large
floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some
alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
