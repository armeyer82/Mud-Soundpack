00:06:10 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:14:10 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:17:20 Eli says to Ather, "I never knew that you were a fan of puppets."

00:17:38 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Everyone is a puppet, with strings to pull!"

00:17:51 Morris Corlew says, "Especially robots."

00:18:09 Ather Jammoa says, "We lal have our strings pulled by our governments. The Mutuality pilots are...Morris, that's just stupid."

00:18:15 Ather Jammoa says, "Robots transcend."

00:18:19 Eli Grey says, "Well, I knew you liked that kinda puppet, just not the ones that are toys."

00:18:22 Eli Grey grins.

00:18:24 Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.

00:18:27 Morris Corlew chuckles. "Robots can't even think for themselves."

00:19:01 Ather Jammoa says, "Shows how much you know about robots."

00:19:01 Multicolored fish flakes drop from above and float on the surface. The fish eagerly gobble them up.

00:19:12 Eli Grey says, "I'm quite thankful for that, if they could they'd have likely decided we were obselete a long time ago."

00:19:26 Morris says to Ather, "Robots are programmed. They don't make decisions for themselves."

00:19:29 Ather says to Eli, "Robots right now are amassing and preparing."

00:19:48 Ather Jammoa says, "They are going to use the artificial intelligence guiding system that was once on the Jupiter crash."

00:19:55 Ather Jammoa says, "It will lead them to ultimate victory."

00:20:16 "There's a difference between 'robots'" Morris Corlew chuckles.

00:20:24 Ather Jammoa says, "Now there's one intelligent machine. I'd love to talk to it again."

00:20:32 Eli Grey says, "Yes, but burning our own buttholes while lighting our own farts, will surely save us."

00:20:34 Morris Corlew chuckles. "There's a difference between robots and artificial intelligence."

00:20:40 Ather says to Morris, "An artificial intelligence system could theoreticlaly upload itself into a robot."

00:20:56 Ather says to Eli, "Pierre will be saved above all others!"

00:20:59 Morris says to Ather, "Theoretically says nothing for all robots."

00:21:01 Eli Grey cackles!

00:21:25 Ather says to Morris, "Why not? If an artificial intelligence could upload its personality matrix into all robots, all robots will have a level of artificial intelligence."

00:21:42 Morris says to Ather, "It's still artificial."

00:21:51 Ather Jammoa says, "Hi my name is morris and I only like dumb felo woo woo woo."

00:21:56 Ather hmphs.

00:22:00 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Robots are more aware than felo!"

00:22:23 Morris says to Ather, "Robots can't change their behavior without reprogramming them. Felo learn who they can trust and who they can't."

00:22:30 Ather Jammoa says, "And robots live longer than felo, too."

00:22:32 Ather Jammoa chortles.

00:22:38 Morris Corlew asks, "So?"

00:22:55 Damien Goss says, "Arobot actually can't since a robot is a machine, the programming and or artificial intelligence is added later."

00:22:59 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Indefinite living is the true key to existance and inevitably, ultimate happiness!"

00:23:18 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Damien Goss and nods.

00:23:19 Damien Goss says, "A robot is the physical structure software is put into."

00:23:39 Ather Jammoa says, "That just means that they can adapt better."

00:23:44 Damien Goss nods to Ather Jammoa.

00:23:53 Damien Goss says, "Well except to underwater environments."

00:23:57 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Hail the robots!"

00:24:22 Eli Grey says, "I'd love to see the mainframe for one of these AIs, I bet it's enormous."

00:24:28 Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.

00:24:36 Eli Grey says, "Imean.. this thing I'm waring is pretty freakin huge and it just stores a little bit of text."

00:24:40 Eli Grey pats a personal filing computer lightly.

00:24:42 Ather Jammoa chuckles.

00:24:47 Ather Jammoa asks, "I know, right?"

00:24:52 Ather Jammoa says, "It can't even do complex calculations."

00:25:06 Ather Jammoa says, "But, I'll tell you, for the notes I keep on it, it's a total lifesaver."

00:25:08 Morris Corlew says, "Can't even do simple calculations."

00:25:20 Morris says to Ather, "A robot that has to keep notes on a computer."

00:25:21 Morris Corlew nods.

00:25:27 Morris Corlew says, "Because robots are superior."

00:25:28 Morris Corlew nods.

00:25:34 Eli Grey says, "Is the AI that was on Jupiter Crash even of human designs? I mean if it was alien that would make more sense to me."

00:25:42 Ather says to Eli, "Na, pretty sure it's human."

00:25:50 Ather Jammoa says, "Well, human design."

00:26:07 Ather Jammoa says, "And, I only keep the notes as points of reference just in case! I actually rarely need to refer to them."

00:26:30 Morris says to Ather, "Mmhmm."

00:26:32 Nissi Valdaire says, "It was renegade tech which probably means Outsiders."

00:26:37 Ather Jammoa says, "I rewrote a bunch of stuff in the stupid upgrades book without referring to my notes even once."

00:26:40 Ather Jammoa chuckles.

00:26:40 Eli Grey says, "There's just gotta be some alien tech involved somewhere."

00:26:48 Ather says to Nissi, "Oh yeah, true, it was renegade tech."

00:26:49 Eli says to Nissi, "Aha! Ok now that I get."

00:27:16 Ather Jammoa says, "All hail artificial subsumation."

00:27:52 Eli Grey says, "I just kept imaging someone saying "Ok here's your new AI system, it can make decisions but unfortuantely it's the size of Bikura'"

00:27:56 Ather Jammoa grins at Eli Grey.

00:28:06 Morris Corlew chuckles.

00:28:10 I don't understand that.

00:28:12 I don't understand that.

00:28:14 Morris says to Eli, "You callin Ather fat?"

00:28:14 You chuckle.

00:28:16 You blink heavily and then doze off.

00:28:23 Ather Jammoa says, "I prefer chubby."

00:28:29 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

00:28:56 Eli Grey says, "Well, it would have to be his brain, and I'm not sure that 'Your rain's as big as a panet" is really much of a burn."

00:29:01 Eli Grey chuckles.

00:29:05 Morris Corlew laughs.

00:29:20 Morris Corlew asks, "Kinda like callin him big-headed?"

00:29:55 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

00:30:38 Eli glances upwards for a moment.

00:30:41 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

00:31:11 Eli swims upward and retrieves a remaining fish food flake.

00:31:32 Eli floats, suspended in the water, while he examines the flake thoughtfully.

00:31:47 Eli says down tot he folks below, "You guys ever try one of these?"

00:31:51 Morris says to Eli, "You that hungry?"

00:32:10 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:32:17 Eli nibbles at the flake.

00:32:29 Eli Grey says, "Hmm.. kinda bland."

00:32:42 Morris Corlew shakes his head and chuckles.

00:33:14 Eli swims back down to the floor. He grabs a soft square brown floor cushion and pushes his butt down onto it.

00:33:18 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

00:33:39 Eli Grey says, "Not as terrible as I thought."

00:34:11 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:35:04 Eli stares in apparent aw at a deep sea fiver.

00:40:16 Lily Kaise (asleep)
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of soft dark pink slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 
00:40:16 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

00:40:32 The group of tetras zooms around the bowl in tight circles.

00:45:50 Eli Grey removes a metallic silver touch einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

00:45:54 Eli Grey turns a phone-based holoemitter on.

00:46:22 Eli Grey turns a phone-based holoemitter off.

00:46:25 Eli Grey places a metallic silver touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

00:48:46 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

00:48:53 Eli swims over to a large snail.

00:49:21 Eli grabs ahold of the top of the snail's shell and pulls himself on top, as though he were riding it.

00:49:33 Eli Grey begins perched atop a large snail.

00:49:56 Damien Goss stands up.

00:49:58 Morris says to Eli, "Careful, that thing might bite you."

00:50:01 Damien Goss says, "Have fun, don't get bucked off."

00:50:02 Eli Grey exclaims, "Yeeee haw!"

00:50:04 Damien Goss waves.

00:50:07 Damien Goss steps south.

00:50:48 Eli says to Morris, "He'd have to probably b e alittle quicker, but I'll be careful."

00:50:58 The neon green plastic plant slowly undulates.

00:51:02 Morris says to Eli, "Slow bite's still a bite."

00:51:07 Eli says to a large snail, "You're alright , right little guy?"

00:51:23 Eli Grey says, "I don't think snails have teeth."

00:51:37 Eli Grey asks, "Don't they have like.. a weird tongue thingie?"

00:51:38 Morris says to Eli, "It's a rift snail. Not an Earth snail. Never know."

00:51:39 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

00:51:45 Eli Grey stops perched atop a large snail.

00:51:47 Eli Grey suddenly falls over.

00:51:49 Eli Grey says, "Oof."

00:51:49 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

00:51:56 Morris Corlew chuckles.

00:52:04 Eli Grey stands up.

00:52:09 Eli dusts himself off.

00:52:14 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

00:52:18 Eli Grey says, "Well that was fun while it lasted."

00:53:27 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

00:53:55 Eli Grey says, "Wow, beaitiful speed. I hadn't actually checked that until just now."

00:54:03 Morris Corlew nods.

00:56:11 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

01:01:27 Eli Grey says, "This riftscape always seems kinda boring.."

01:01:47 Morris Corlew says, "Least we mostly seem to pass inspection."

01:01:52 Eli Grey says, "At least Melinda is wearing her butt shorts again."

01:01:55 Eli Grey nods to Morris Corlew.

01:02:01 Eli says to Morris, "I suppose that's true."

01:02:07 Eli Grey asks, "What would happen if we didn't?"

01:02:08 Eli Grey shivers.

01:02:16 Morris Corlew says, "I...don't think I wanna know."

01:07:38 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:08:37 Melinda Michaels examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

01:08:39 Melinda Michaels helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

01:08:44 Melinda Michaels asks, "How's it going?"

01:09:02 Morris Corlew says, "Goin ok."

01:09:05 Melinda Michaels nods.

01:13:29 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

01:18:43 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:19:08 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:19:11 Lily Kaise waves.

01:19:37 Morris Corlew says, "Yo."

01:19:47 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:21:31 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

01:22:14 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:22:15 Lily Kaise glides south.

01:22:54 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

01:23:48 Eli Grey blinks heavily and then dozes off.

01:24:03 Morris Corlew stretches.

01:24:59 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

01:25:09 Luja stretches too.

01:25:11 Luja Garland says, "Hello."

01:25:21 Morris Corlew grins at Luja Garland.

01:27:32 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

01:27:34 Morris Corlew examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

01:27:37 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Morris Corlew removes a small round personal pepperoni pizza from the open compartment.

01:27:59 Morris picks a bit of pepperoni from his pizza and pops it in his mouth.

01:28:20 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small round personal pepperoni pizza.

01:31:52 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

01:32:01 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:32:02 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:33:26 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

01:34:02 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:34:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:38:30 Lily Kaise slumps in a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe and goes to sleep.

01:38:59 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

01:42:29 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

01:42:31 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:43:29 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

01:43:38 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

01:43:59 Aisling the Fox switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

01:44:02 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

01:44:27 Lily Kaise

01:44:27 eria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

01:44:54 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:44:56 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, Manx the little calico CatBot, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
Vernos Bailey is sleeping on a silky indigo cushion.
Aisling the Fox is sitting on a round saffron orange zafu. Melinda Michaels and Nissi Valdaire are sitting on a white leather sofa. Rogue Romano is dozing on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow. Luja Garland and Morris Corlew a
01:44:56 re sitting on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow. Eli Grey is dozing on a soft square brown floor cushion. Anfisa the Wanderer, Jason Rat, Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec, and Ather Jammoa are dozing on a white leather sofa. Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

01:44:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:45:02 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:45:15 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:45:21 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:45:31 Lily says to you, "Hey Handsome!"

01:45:34 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:45:41 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Hey beautiful."

01:51:22 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small round personal pepperoni pizza.

01:52:22 Lily Kaise removes an orange egg from a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

01:52:27 Lily Kaise puts an orange egg on a maple coffee table.

01:53:00 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

01:53:09 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

01:53:18 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

01:54:05 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings spins itself around in tight circles.

01:55:59 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

01:57:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:58:59 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters west.

02:00:06 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:07:29 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

02:08:05 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

02:13:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:13:59 A black digital felo game emits a sprightly beep as the felo wakes up.

02:14:07 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:14:59 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

02:17:59 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.

02:19:37 Luja Garland says, "Stretching my legs for a bit."

02:19:40 Luja Garland stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:19:42 Morris Corlew nods.

02:19:44 Luja Garland steps south.

02:20:00 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:23:09 A massive sphere looms ahead of the hovertruck, soon becoming evident as a slow-rolling ball of tentacles. The truck moves around it smoothly.

02:23:24 Morris Corlew says, "Tentacles."

02:23:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:24:07 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

02:26:07 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

02:26:59 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:29:56 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

02:30:00 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.

02:32:29 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

02:32:51 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:32:58 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:33:07 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:35:20 Luja Garland steps in from the south.

02:35:22 Luja Garland sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:35:29 Luja Garland gives a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

02:36:45 You wave to Luja Garland.

02:39:00 Luja Garland smiles at you.

02:39:01 Luja Garland says, "Hello."

02:40:14 You say to Luja, "Hi."

02:40:27 A single snowglobe zips up to the hovertrailer and circles you once before continuing on.

02:40:38 Morris Corlew grins.

02:40:45 Lily Kaise says, "Keep on truckin' snowglobe."

02:40:50 Morris Corlew says, "Mmhmm."

02:40:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:41:14 You grin.

02:41:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:44:07 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:45:15 Morris Corlew says, "Still don't blame that snowglobe for what it did to Herrick. Some jerk did that to me. Yeah...I'd do the same thing."

02:45:52 Lily Kaise blinks.

02:46:01 Morris Corlew asks, "What?"

02:46:33 Luja Garland says, "I'm not sticking a snowglobe into anywhere."

02:46:34 Lily Kaise says, "I thought he encouraged it though."

02:47:06 Morris Corlew says, "That's the point...both of ya. Don't stick stuff where it don't belong, don't violate others...if ya do, ya deserve whatcha get."

02:47:19 Lily Kaise says, "Most definitely."

02:47:23 You nod.

02:47:52 Morris Corlew says, "Still think they're awful fascinatin. Heard a story once about somebody pettin one and it seemed to like it."

02:48:00 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:48:09 Lily Kaise says, "Well I still would keep my distance."

02:48:11 "Who don't like gettin petted?" Morris Corlew shrugs.

02:48:15 Morris Corlew grins.

02:48:17 You say, "Yeah, me too."

02:48:19 Lily Kaise pets you on the head.

02:48:22 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:48:25 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:48:27 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:48:33 You say, "Meant. I'd keep my distance."

02:49:16 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:50:54 The hovertrailer carrying you fishtails briefly.

02:52:20 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the south.

02:52:21 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:52:28 Luja Garland says, "Hi, Sarah."

02:52:31 Morris says to Sarah Bellamy, "Howdy sweets."

02:52:41 You wave to Sarah Bellamy.

02:52:43 Sarah Bellamy says, "Hi Moosey, hi Luja."

02:52:55 Sarah rubs her eyes.

02:52:59 Sarah Bellamy bebops east.

02:52:59 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:53:24 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the east.

02:53:24 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

02:53:26 Sarah Bellamy sits down on Morris Corlew's lap.

02:53:33 Morris Corlew hugs Sarah Bellamy.

02:53:36 Sarah Bellamy hugs Morris Corlew.

02:53:37 Morris Corlew kisses Sarah Bellamy softly on the neck.

02:53:42 Sarah Bellamy says, "MMmmmmmm."

02:53:53 Sarah Bellamy kisses Morris Corlew on the nose.

02:53:55 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

02:53:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:54:05 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

02:54:07 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

02:54:09 Morris Corlew says, "Aww."

02:54:28 Sarah Bellamy takes a bite of a B.L.T. sandwich.

02:54:36 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a small round personal pepperoni pizza.

02:54:44 Sarah Bellamy takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

02:55:04 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:55:14 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:57:58 Luja says to Sarah, "How are you?"

02:58:11 Sarah says to Luja, "I'm excellent, how are you?"

02:58:31 Luja Garland says, "Doing good. Not much going on at the moment, though."

02:58:39 Sarah Bellamy says, "No it's pretty quiet."

03:00:48 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:00:58 Morris Corlew finishes off a small round personal pepperoni pizza.

03:01:00 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

03:01:05 Morris Corlew strokes a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki's bristly hair.

03:01:18 Sarah Bellamy takes a bite of a B.L.T. sandwich.

03:01:22 Sarah Bellamy takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

03:03:00 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with her back feet, then eats it.

03:03:25 Morris Corlew says, "Ick."

03:05:09 Sarah Bellamy says, "I'm sure there's a reason they do that."

03:05:12 Sarah Bellamy takes a bite of a B.L.T. sandwich.

03:05:17 Morris Corlew says, "Don't make it not gross."

03:05:44 Sarah Bellamy says, "I dunno. It doesn't bug me too much now that I've seen it."

03:05:48 Sarah Bellamy shrugs helplessly.

03:05:50 Luja Garland slumps in a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe and goes to sleep.

03:05:53 Morris Corlew says, "Yuck."

03:06:21 Sarah Bellamy takes a bite of a B.L.T. sandwich.

03:06:25 Sarah Bellamy takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

03:06:37 Luja Garland suddenly awakens.

03:07:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:08:08 Sarah Bellamy finishes off a B.L.T. sandwich.

03:08:13 Sarah Bellamy takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

03:08:30 Sarah Bellamy finishes off a glass of chilled orange juice.

03:08:41 Sarah Bellamy says, "Consume breakfast. Check."

03:08:54 Sarah Bellamy gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:08:57 Morris says to Sarah, "Snuggle with Moose..."

03:08:59 Morris Corlew snuggles up to Sarah Bellamy's shoulder.

03:09:04 Sarah Bellamy says, "Mmmmmm check."

03:09:06 Morris Corlew says, "Check."

03:09:07 Luja Garland smiles.

03:09:08 Morris Corlew grins.

03:09:09 Sarah Bellamy wraps her arms around Morris Corlew, pulling him close.

03:09:24 Eli Grey blinks.

03:09:36 Lily Kaise waves to Eli Grey.

03:09:40 You wave to Eli Grey.

03:09:44 Sarah Bellamy waves to Eli Grey.

03:09:53 Eli rubs his eyes and then waves.

03:09:59 Lily Kaise grins.

03:10:37 Eli Grey says, "Wow, even faster than when I fell asleep."

03:10:48 Luja Garland says, "Hi, Eli."

03:10:58 Eli says to Luja, "Oh hey there."

03:12:07 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

03:12:19 Morris Corlew runs his fingers back and forth through Sarah Bellamy's hair.

03:13:27 You hear a clanging noise up ahead. The train applies its brakes, slowing to yield to another train.

03:13:35 Eli Grey says, "Whoa."

03:13:44 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

03:13:55 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:13:57 Morris Corlew says, "What the..."

03:14:00 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki taps her claws on the floor.

03:14:02 Morris Corlew says, "Look athta that flow."

03:14:09 Eli Grey says, "What the hell, our speed dropped like a son of a bitch."

03:14:12 Morris Corlew coughs. "I mean look at that flow."

03:14:14 Morris Corlew says, "Not just our speed."

03:14:18 Morris Corlew frowns.

03:14:21 Morris Corlew nudges Sarah Bellamy gently.

03:14:24 Morris says to Sarah, "Up a sec?"

03:14:32 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

03:14:52 Morris gently wiggles out from under Sarah.

03:14:54 Eli Grey asks, "There.. was.. another train? does tha tmean someone else was travelling int he rift?"

03:14:56 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:14:56 Sarah Bellamy falls from Morris Corlew's lap.

03:14:59 Morris Corlew pats Sarah Bellamy on the back.

03:15:00 Morris Corlew says, "Sec."

03:15:01 Morris Corlew lopes south.

03:15:20 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:15:22 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nothing on long-range scans and the drive is fine."

03:15:31 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:15:31 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

03:15:37 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Reminds me of..."

03:15:43 I don't understand that.

03:16:10 Eli Grey glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

03:16:37 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

03:16:39 Luja Garland says, "Yeah, our speed isn't too good."

03:16:43 Morris Corlew says, "It's not just our speed."

03:16:49 Morris Corlew says, "Look at the local flow."

03:16:56 Eli says to Luja, "It was at 5900 like less then two minutes ago.. the flow went to nothing too."

03:17:01 Morris Corlew nods.

03:17:02 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

03:17:08 Morris Corlew says, "Somethin's..."

03:17:09 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:17:14 Eli Grey says, "Somethign weird happened.. there was another train and we had to brake..."

03:17:32 Morris Corlew says, "Reminds me of the doldrums around Spinward Clan space."

03:17:50 Eli Grey asks, "The doldrums?"

03:17:54 Morris Corlew says, "But...what I can't recall is if that was gradual. I don't even remember if I was awake when we entered the area."

03:17:56 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

03:17:58 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hm."

03:18:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:18:05 Morris says to Eli, "It's an area of...from what we can tell permanent calm."

03:18:13 Morris says to Nissi, "Nothing on long-range scans."

03:18:22 Eli says to Morris, "Well.. if it's something like that.. then we sure slammed into it."

03:18:27 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

03:18:52 Morris says to Nissi, "Do you happen to remember...out in that area...if it's sudden when ya enter it?"

03:18:59 Luja Garland says, "That is so cool. A calm area of space."

03:19:26 Melinda Michaels asks, "What?"

03:19:41 Morris says to Melinda, "We...passed another train. The local flow dropped by about 80%."

03:19:54 Morris says to Melinda, "Instantly."

03:19:58 Nissi Valdaire says, "Pretty much I think. The rift hallucinations will reflect it too, if that's what it is."

03:19:58 Eli says to Melinda, "Somethign weird just happened. We were booking at nearly 6000 when yeah, antoher train and we hit the brakes."

03:20:02 Morris says to Melinda, "Nothin on the scanner."

03:20:04 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:20:14 Eli Grey asks, "So we shouldn't drop out and look around or anything?"

03:20:16 Melinda Michaels says, "Hmm, we didn't pass it going out."

03:20:17 Morris says to Nissi, "I mighta been sleepin when we entered the area, so couldn't remember."

03:20:29 Morris says to Eli, "Well, we'd see somethin on the rift sensors."

03:20:33 Nissi Valdaire says, "This would be a good time to deploy a storm."

03:20:39 Morris says to Melinda, "We're in a slightly different area."

03:20:52 Melinda Michaels says, "Slightly but not much."

03:20:52 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:20:54 Morris Corlew nods.

03:21:03 Eli Grey asks, "That it was another train is.. It's not something else travelling in the rift, right?"

03:21:08 Aisling the Fox says, "Ah. We are in a calm."

03:21:13 Morris says to Eli, "Not necessarily."

03:21:19 Eli Grey nods to Morris Corlew.

03:21:31 Morris says to Eli, "The sudden braking I think was the key."

03:21:43 Eli Grey nods.

03:21:45 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

03:21:45 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

03:21:56 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "Too bad Ather is useless and is asleep."

03:21:59 Aisling the Fox pokes Ather Jammoa in the ribs!

03:22:00 Eli Grey says, "We only braked though because of hte other train.. but yeah, I get what you are saying."

03:22:01 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

03:22:08 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Anybody have a key to that bolt?"

03:22:17 Aisling the Fox says, "No. He refuses to give other key out."

03:22:26 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:22:29 Nissi Valdaire says, "Oh. Well. That's useless."

03:22:31 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

03:22:40 Aisling the Fox says, "Like I said, he is useless."

03:22:42 Aisling the Fox pokes Ather Jammoa in the ribs!

03:22:45 Eli Grey says, "He mentioned something about letting me borrow a key for the trip, but we never got around to it."

03:23:10 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

03:23:48 Eli Grey asks, "Could it also calm, because a storm is already building? Sorry.. I know the weather stuff is just analogies, but could it be?"

03:23:53 Morris Corlew says, "If we are in a calm, like the one up in the spinward clan area, the bolt probably won't work."

03:23:56 The train inches along.

03:24:11 Melinda Michaels says, "Hmmm."

03:24:25 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Bolt will not work in calms, no."

03:24:30 Morris Corlew nods.

03:24:35 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Only way is to deal with it."

03:24:44 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Eventually will push through."

03:24:51 Eli Grey says, "Well.. at least it's still in our favor, we're not going too too slow."

03:24:52 You nod to Anfisa the Wanderer.

03:24:55 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Good speed for calm though."

03:24:57 Morris Corlew says, "These rift scenes will likely be quite...interesting."

03:25:03 Morris Corlew nods to Anfisa the Wanderer.

03:25:13 Eli Grey nods to Anfisa the Wanderer.

03:25:30 Morris Corlew says, "I'm not a fan of the war one in calms. It's...the gas is...not."

03:25:31 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:25:34 Eli Grey says, "We could probably even catch a little bit of that eastern flow if we wanted to, considering where we are."

03:25:35 Melinda says to Eli, "Speed is pretty not good."

03:25:55 Morris Corlew says, "Our speed compared to the flow is great."

03:26:01 Sarah Bellamy nods.

03:26:02 Melinda Michaels says, "Sure but still not good."

03:26:04 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

03:26:06 Nissi Valdaire says, "Positivity is needed."

03:26:06 You nod.

03:26:07 You chuckle.

03:26:08 Eli says to Melinda, "I jus tmean that we're still getting all of it, which is good."

03:26:11 Morris Corlew gives Nissi Valdaire a high five.

03:26:12 Melinda says to Nissi, "What's that?"

03:26:14 Nissi Valdaire presses a few buttons on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, sending a message.

03:26:14 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device chirps quietly, indicating that it has begun sending a message.

03:26:14 Eli Grey says, "At least it's not liek this and in our face."

03:26:15 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:26:29 Morris Corlew looks at Nissi Valdaire thoughtfully.

03:26:32 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

03:26:38 Morris says to Eli, "I've seen that. It's..."

03:26:40 Morris Corlew nods.

03:27:32 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

03:27:35 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:27:51 Eli Grey says, "Overall, I'm just relieved that someone knew what hte hell was going on."

03:27:53 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

03:27:55 Morris Corlew sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

03:28:08 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

03:28:15 Melinda Michaels says, "The only other area I've seen this in is the Spinward area."

03:28:16 Sarah Bellamy blinks.

03:28:21 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:28:27 Lily Kaise slumps in a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe and goes to sleep.

03:28:28 Morris Corlew says, "Only one I've ever heard referenced."

03:28:29 Sarah Bellamy glances around at her surroundings.

03:28:35 Eli says to Melinda, "Rimward? Hmm."

03:28:39 Sarah Bellamy sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:28:42 Melinda Michaels says, "Interesting what just 3 LTC's east can get you."

03:28:47 Morris Corlew nods. "Yep."

03:28:56 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:28:57 Melinda says to Eli, "That's Spinward."

03:29:11 Eli says to Melinda, "Oh.. right.. I thought you said Rimward."

03:29:15 Melinda says to Eli, "No."

03:30:17 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:30:47 Lily Kaise (asleep)
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of soft dark pink slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Ast
03:30:47 eria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

03:31:26 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

03:31:38 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:31:40 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:31:59 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:31:59 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:32:01 Morris Corlew stands up from a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

03:32:01 Morris Corlew lopes south.

03:32:07 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:32:09 Eli Grey asks, "What's the planetary time on that speed?"

03:32:11 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

03:32:13 Morris Corlew sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

03:32:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:32:46 Lily Kaise removes Lily Kaise's workbench from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:32:49 I don't see that here.

03:32:52 Lily Kaise puts down Lily Kaise's workbench.

03:32:53 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:32:59 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:33:02 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

03:33:04 Lily Kaise stands before Lily Kaise's workbench and gathers various supplies, then skillfully assembles them into a wrist-mounted chronometer.

03:33:34 Lily Kaise stands before Lily Kaise's workbench and gathers various supplies, then skillfully assembles them into a wrist-mounted chronometer.

03:33:59 Lily Kaise asks, "Eli you do have a chronometer right?"

03:34:13 Eli Grey says, "I have a pocketwatch.."

03:34:18 Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

03:34:20 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:34:28 Eli Grey asks, "Doesn't it do the same thing?"

03:34:35 The train inches along.

03:34:39 Lily Kaise asks, "But this is 'does it do both Cyclical and Earthly time?"

03:34:59 Eli Grey says, "Oh, no it's kind of old fashioned."

03:35:02 A Tardick lizard named Raissa trundles slowly into the area.

03:35:11 Lily Kaise removes a wrist-mounted chronometer from Lily Kaise's workbench.

03:35:17 Lily Kaise gives a wrist-mounted chronometer to Eli Grey.

03:35:19 Eli Grey says, "Hmm."

03:35:23 Lily Kaise removes a wrist-mounted chronometer from Lily Kaise's workbench.

03:35:27 Eli Grey pokes and prods at a wrist-mounted chronometer.

03:35:29 Lily Kaise gives a wrist-mounted chronometer to Vernos Bailey.

03:35:34 Lily Kaise picks up Lily Kaise's workbench.

03:35:38 Lily Kaise puts Lily Kaise's workbench in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:35:39 Eli Grey glances down at his wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

03:35:41 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:35:52 Lily Kaise says, "They are nice to have."

03:35:53 Sarah Bellamy glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:36:03 Lily Kaise glances down at her neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

03:36:11 Eli Grey removes a can of metallic silver paint from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

03:36:14 Eli Grey neatly covers a wrist-mounted chronometer with a coat of metallic silver paint.

03:36:15 Lily Kaise grins.

03:36:19 Eli Grey puts a can of metallic silver paint in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

03:36:26 Eli Grey puts on a metallic silver wrist-mounted chronometer.

03:36:27 Sarah Bellamy removes a wrist-mounted chronometer from a black velvet drawstring purse.

03:36:32 Sarah Bellamy puts on a wrist-mounted chronometer.

03:36:32 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki jerks her limbs, springing into the air briefly.

03:36:35 Eli Grey smiles at Lily Kaise.

03:36:40 Eli says to Lily, "Thanks!"

03:36:41 Sarah Bellamy glances down at her wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

03:36:46 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Sure!"

03:37:02 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:37:09 Lily Kaise says, "I have a very pretty watch but it only does Earthly time."

03:37:14 Morris Corlew says to Sarah, "Some paint over in the rec room. Probably somethin you'd like."

03:37:18 Sarah Bellamy says, "I don't know how to read cyclic."

03:37:18 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:37:24 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:37:25 Morris Corlew glances down at his mirror finish chrome wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

03:37:36 Sarah Bellamy smiles at Morris Corlew.

03:37:36 Sarah Bellamy scrambles to her feet.

03:37:36 Sarah Bellamy bebops west.
Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:37:51 Eli Grey says, "I read Anfisa's book on it, but it's still beyond me most of the time. I should reall y just sit down and learn it."

03:38:23 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:38:47 Sarah Bellamy bebops in from the west.

03:38:47 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:38:54 Sarah Bellamy says to Morris Corlew, "You moved."

03:38:57 Sarah Bellamy sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:39:02 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:39:06 Morris Corlew says to Sarah Bellamy, "Had to get out from under ya. Plus, didn't wanna crowd Luja."

03:39:13 Eli Grey says, "He had to get up to do the thing."

03:39:18 Morris Corlew nods.

03:39:24 Sarah Bellamy says, "Good point."

03:39:25 Sarah Bellamy stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:39:29 Morris says to Sarah, "Was checkin long-range scanners and stuff."

03:39:44 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:40:04 Sarah Bellamy says, "ALl pillows taken."

03:40:07 Sarah Bellamy sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

03:40:14 Morris Corlew nods to Sarah Bellamy. "Why I'm sittin here."

03:42:38 Morris says to Melinda, "What?"

03:42:47 Melinda says to Morris, "Nothing."

03:42:58 Morris Corlew looks at Melinda Michaels and shrugs and absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:43:03 Sarah says to Melinda, "Was a real question. I need to learn some things and he teaches well."

03:43:19 Melinda says to Sarah, "I am sure he does."

03:43:24 Eli elbows Melinda playfully.

03:43:27 Melinda Michaels pokes Eli Grey in the ribs!

03:43:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:43:33 Luja Garland says, "I can confirm that."

03:43:39 Melinda Michaels says, "Well now."

03:43:45 Melinda Michaels says, "This could be interesting."

03:43:47 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:43:49 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

03:44:03 Sarah covers her face and laughs, shaking her head violently. "Not that teaching!

03:44:08 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:44:09 Morris Corlew asks, "Wait, what?"

03:44:14 Melinda says to Sarah, "What?"

03:44:27 Sarah Bellamy exclaims, "I meant piloty type teaching!"

03:44:30 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

03:44:35 Morris says to Sarah, "What else would ya mean?"

03:44:38 Melinda Michaels says, "So did I."

03:44:43 Melinda Michaels smirks.

03:44:46 You chuckle at Melinda Michaels.

03:44:51 Sarah Bellamy says, "But you guys were elbowin and nudgin and Luja and you....."

03:44:51 Melinda Michaels says, "Perverts."

03:44:55 Melinda Michaels sighs.

03:44:56 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

03:45:01 You say to Melinda, "I knew what you meant."

03:45:01 The train inches along.

03:45:08 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:45:08 Melinda says to you, "Good."

03:45:14 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:45:14 Eli Grey chuckles.

03:45:15 Luja Garland exclaims, "I didn't get it!"

03:45:17 Aisling the Fox says, "Choo choo."

03:45:28 Morris Corlew puts a mirror finish chrome hyperspanner in a slate blue leather gear bag.

03:45:32 A Tardick lizard named Raissa flicks its tail.

03:45:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Y'all got sex stuff on the brain."

03:45:37 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:45:43 Lily Kaise grins.

03:45:46 Sarah Bellamy says, "I didn't at first...But I saw the nudges."

03:45:48 Aisling the Fox says, "That seems to be constant with pilots."

03:45:49 Morris Corlew says, "I am not a member of subgroup 'y'all.'"

03:46:01 Eli Grey says, "Is brain sex a thing now? I wouldn't be surprised."

03:46:02 Melinda Michaels says, "Nudges? What ever are you talking about? I wouldn't dare."

03:46:07 Sarah Bellamy laughs.

03:46:07 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

03:46:08 Aisling the Fox says, "Sex sex sexity sex sex and tits."

03:46:08 Morris Corlew asks, "Brain...sex?"

03:46:19 Sarah Bellamy laughs at Aisling the Fox.

03:46:29 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

03:46:31 I don't see that here.

03:52:36 Lily Kaise examines a personal pizza oven for a moment.

03:52:42 A personal pizza oven makes a slight buzzing sound in confirmation and the interior begins to glow a faint orange. Several loud clicks and clunks come from the contraption and it shudders for a moment before a drawn-out hissing sound is heard. After a long moment of silence, the glow fades and a door in the front opens and Lily Kaise removes a small round personal kitchen sink pizza from the open compartment.

03:52:53 Lily Kaise dangles a small round personal kitchen sink pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

03:54:48 "It says You're doing great." Eli Grey laughs.

03:54:54 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

03:54:55 Eli Grey asks, "What in the world?"

03:55:02 Morris Corlew shrugs and gestures vaguely at Nissi Valdaire.

04:04:01 You wave to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:04:05 Aisling the Fox waves to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:04:08 Aisling the Fox says, "We are in calm."

04:04:09 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

04:04:25 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Oh nice."

04:05:30 Cheri Lindbergh navigates her dark metallic pink touch shoes interface to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:05:37 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:05:46 Cheri Lindbergh switches a dark metallic pink touch shoes interface off.

04:05:56 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "I knew that some cycle would let us go far and then trap us on the return."

04:06:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Rift, that is."

04:06:12 Cheri Lindbergh nods.

04:06:16 Luja Garland says, "I should sleep."

04:06:23 Morris says to Luja, "Rest well."

04:06:25 Luja Garland stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:06:29 You wave to Luja Garland. "Night. Rest well."

04:06:30 Luja Garland says, "After the tub."

04:06:32 Lily Kaise waves to Luja Garland.

04:06:34 Morris Corlew nods.

04:06:34 Luja Garland grins.

04:06:35 Luja Garland steps south.

04:06:46 Morris Corlew asks, "Tubes?"

04:06:59 Luja Garland steps in from the south.

04:07:02 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Pierre talks funny sometimes."

04:07:02 Luja Garland examines a small hot tea dispenser for a moment.

04:07:06 Luja Garland helps herself to a cup of hot red rooibos tea.

04:07:07 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Fine pipes."

04:07:08 Luja Garland steps west.

04:07:11 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

04:07:12 Morris Corlew nods.

04:07:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:07:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Shouldn't be too bad, got some reserve power."

04:11:24 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "How far away from farport are we?"

04:11:34 Morris Corlew says, "Uhm..."

04:11:37 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:11:45 Morris Corlew asks, "179 LTC or so?"

04:12:11 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Not too bad."

04:12:26 Morris Corlew nods.

04:12:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "A fine distance."

04:14:04 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

04:14:07 Cheri Lindbergh shrugs. "It could definitely be worse."

04:14:43 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Maybe Luja is in danger of drowning in tub, I should go save her."

04:15:31 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Haha."

04:16:04 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

04:16:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec nods to a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki for some reason.

04:16:15 You peer west...

04:16:15 
[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Recreation]
Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a folding gaming table, a sheet of red paper, a portable hot tub, a beige plastic box labeled 'Paints & Games', a Tardick lizard named Thor, and a plush light blue towel here.
You can go east.

04:16:39 You peer south...

Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

04:16:44 Aisling the Fox strokes a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki's bristly hair.

04:16:49 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Is time for glorious heroics or something."

04:16:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Woo."

04:16:53 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec stands up from a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

04:16:54 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves west.

04:17:27 Cheri Lindbergh sighs. "Pierre is such a fine hero."

04:17:54 Aisling the Fox says, "I am not sure he is using that word correctly."

04:18:04 Cheri Lindbergh nods to Aisling the Fox.

04:18:32 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Being a hero at New Quebec is probably a lot different from most places."

04:18:34 A Tardick lizard named Thor trundles slowly into the area.

04:20:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:27:54 Sarah Bellamy stands up from a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

04:27:56 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:27:57 Sarah Bellamy sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:28:04 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

04:28:08 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:28:09 Lily Kaise says, "Wooooooo."

04:28:09 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:28:09 A readout shows Neutron Star 4717-5971 about 6.43 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Very Slightly Up.

04:28:13 Melinda Michaels stands up from a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

04:28:20 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

04:28:24 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah, it's a different one."

04:28:30 Melinda Michaels asks, "Is it?"

04:28:31 Lily Kaise says, "Wow a second one for this trip."

04:28:32 Morris Corlew nods.

04:28:36 Sarah Bellamy exclaims, "Cool!"

04:28:38 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

04:28:49 You grin.

04:28:53 The rainbow pathway curves a wide path around a cloud, banking slightly.

04:29:07 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "The other one was 6601-5184."

04:29:16 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

04:29:34 A Tardick lizard named Thor settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

04:29:48 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Be interestin to see if this one has any survivin planets. That other one had one."

04:30:49 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

04:30:49 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

04:31:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

04:40:36 Eli Grey walks in from the south.

04:40:57 The rainbow pathway curves a wide path around a cloud, banking slightly.

04:41:05 Vernos Bailey suddenly awakens.

04:41:16 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh look who is waking up. You are just lucky that calm is not affected by bolt storm maker."

04:41:17 Aisling the Fox pokes Ather Jammoa in the ribs!

04:41:23 Vernos Bailey glances down at his wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

04:41:25 Rogue Romano says, "Oh no, Verns awake."

04:41:36 Vernos Bailey asks, "What is this about?"

04:41:41 Vernos Bailey taps a wrist-mounted chronometer.

04:41:43 Morris says to Vernos, "We're in a calm area."

04:41:44 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

04:41:46 Lily Kaise says, "Just a nice gadget."

04:41:47 Morris says to Vernos, "Lily."

04:41:59 Vernos Bailey says, "Oh."

04:41:59 Aisling the Fox pats a matte orange oxide wrist-mounted chronometer lightly.

04:42:23 Morris twists a mirror finish chrome wrist-mounted chronometer around in a circle around his wrist.

04:42:32 Vernos Bailey says, "I have a watch but I will have to switch it in and out with this."

04:42:35 Lily Kaise says, "Shows you both cyclical and that other time."

04:42:38 Lily Kaise grins.

04:43:06 Vernos Bailey gives a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:43:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Some coffee to perk that bot up."

04:43:22 Morris Corlew grins.

04:43:24 You chuckle.

04:43:29 Lily Kaise grins.

04:43:31 Ather says to Aisling, "So why is it my fault!?"

04:43:49 Vernos Bailey asks, "So what is an area of calm?"

04:43:54 Aisling the Fox says, "Because we might have used bolt. But you were asleep."

04:43:57 Morris says to Vernos, "Really slow flow and can't use the bolt."

04:43:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Basically a spot where the riftflow doesn't flow as strongly."

04:44:05 Morris says to Vernos, "No artificial storms."

04:44:07 Ather says to Aisling, "But we can't use it!"

04:44:15 Aisling the Fox says, "That is why I said you are lucky."

04:44:20 Aisling the Fox pokes Ather Jammoa in the ribs!

04:44:28 Vernos Bailey asks, "I missed the star?"

04:44:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Na."

04:44:31 Morris Corlew says, "No."

04:44:32 Sarah Bellamy says, "No."

04:44:32 Aisling the Fox says, "No."

04:44:33 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:44:33 A readout shows Neutron Star 4717-5971 about 3.44 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Very Slightly Down.

04:44:39 Ather Jammoa says, "We just seem to have overshot the upward angle."

04:44:44 Vernos Bailey nods.

04:44:48 You drift lazily past still beams of light.

04:45:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:45:05 Morris Corlew says, "With that flow, it happens."

04:45:29 Vernos Bailey asks, "So why can you not use the bolt here?"

04:45:33 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:45:33 A readout shows Neutron Star 4717-5971 about 3.26 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Very Slightly Down.

04:45:34 Morris says to Vernos, "Just can't."

04:45:38 Morris says to Vernos, "It won't work."

04:45:54 Aisling the Fox says, "Maybe not enough flow to flow."

04:45:58 Morris Corlew nods.

04:46:14 Aisling the Fox shrugs.

04:46:51 Ather says to Vernos, "Our understanding of the rift is not...shall we say, even a fraction of the way complete."

04:47:12 Vernos Bailey nods.

04:47:14 Ather Jammoa says, "Even Fienstein, who spent about a decade inside of it probably still doesn't even come close to understanding it."

04:49:38 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:49:38 A readout shows Neutron Star 4717-5971 about 2.52 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Very Slightly Down.

04:50:18 Vernos Bailey says, "Hm okay."

04:50:34 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

04:50:52 Vernos Bailey says, "When you just cant, you cant."

04:50:56 Morris Corlew says, "Gonna be a long time before we fully understand the rift, if at all."

04:51:33 Vernos Bailey nods.

04:52:01 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, I mean Fienstein's best friend with a rift entity and even he doesn't know all of it."

04:52:06 Eli Grey shrugs.

04:52:13 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

04:52:31 Eli Grey says, "Well, I don't know about best friends, but you know what I mean."

04:52:41 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey. "Yep."

04:52:50 Vernos Bailey says, "They get along."

04:53:02 Eli nods and grins at Vernos.

04:53:24 Vernos Bailey puts on a wrist-mounted chronometer.

04:54:11 Vernos Bailey says, "Look ma two watches."

04:54:13 The rainbow pathway curves a wide path around a cloud, banking slightly.

04:54:18 Vernos Bailey snickers.

04:54:20 Eli Grey laughs.

04:54:23 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

04:54:28 Eli Grey says, "Double time-telling action."

04:54:31 Vernos Bailey glances down at his wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

04:54:34 Vernos Bailey glances down at his tasteful gold watch with diamond accents momentarily.

04:55:04 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki taps her claws on the floor.

04:55:18 Sarah says to a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki, "There's nothing under there, I looked."

04:55:26 You drift lazily past still beams of light.

04:55:33 Morris Corlew asks, "Under where?"

04:55:40 Sarah says to Morris, "The floor. She tapped at it."

04:55:51 Morris says to Sarah, "What were you doin under the floor?"

04:55:51 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:55:51 A readout shows Neutron Star 4717-5971 about 1.52 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Slightly Down.

04:55:53 Morris Corlew looks at Sarah Bellamy thoughtfully.

04:56:15 Sarah says to Morris, "I don't remember. But I know there's nothing under it except maybe a weapons room."

04:56:17 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

04:56:23 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:56:27 Morris Corlew says, "Ducts."

04:56:27 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

04:56:29 Morris Corlew stands up from a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

04:56:30 Sarah Bellamy nods to Morris Corlew.

04:56:30 Morris Corlew lifts an unobtrusive panel and makes his way into the starship's network of system ducts.

04:56:45 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

04:56:48 Eli Grey says, "Quick everybody hide."

04:56:48 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

04:56:49 Morris Corlew shrugs. "Plant under there."

04:56:52 Morris Corlew sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

04:56:56 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

04:56:56 Ather Jammoa strides south.

04:57:06 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

04:57:07 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

04:58:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:58:09 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

05:00:35 The hovertruck takes an exit, merging onto another freeway.

05:00:35 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

05:03:08 Vernos Bailey says, "Really calm here."

05:05:51 The hovertruck takes an exit, merging onto another freeway.

05:05:51 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

05:06:05 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki crouches down for a moment.

05:06:07 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

05:06:07 A readout shows Neutron Star 4717-5971 about 177.77 light-cycles toward Galactic Down and Slightly Northeast.

05:06:09 Morris Corlew nods to a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki for some reason.

05:06:09 The hovertruck smoothly negotiates a turn, tilting slightly so you are not thrown off the trailer.

05:06:32 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

05:06:32 A readout shows Neutron Star 4717-5971 about 164.92 light-cycles toward Galactic Down and Slightly Northeast.

05:06:35 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters east.

05:08:10 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

05:09:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

05:09:30 The hovertruck takes an exit, merging onto another freeway.

05:10:20 The hovertruck smoothly negotiates a turn, tilting slightly so you are not thrown off the trailer.

05:10:50 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

05:10:50 A tiny, bright sphere floats in space here; a neutron star, the corpse of a once-massive star. It is a perfect sphere, unlike most stars, and only a few kilometers across. It is not very hot, and according to its sensor profile, radiates mostly in ultraviolet and X-rays.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:10:53 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

05:10:56 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Woo."

05:10:58 Vernos Bailey presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

05:10:59 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

05:10:59 Ather Jammoa strides south.

05:11:02 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

05:11:02 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

05:11:21 You grin.

05:11:49 Rogue Romano scrambles to her feet.

05:11:49 Rogue Romano slinks south.

05:11:59 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

05:12:10 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

05:12:15 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on close approach."

05:13:05 Aisling the Fox stands up from a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

05:13:07 Aisling the Fox prances south.

05:13:07 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

05:13:33 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

05:13:38 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on extended observation."

05:14:19 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:14:56 Eli Grey walks south.

05:15:06 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:15:26 You say to Lily, "You getting sleepy?"

05:15:50 Lily Kaise says, "A little but I want to see this one finish up."

05:15:54 You grin.

05:16:12 Morris Corlew says, "Gonna be a couple hours."

05:16:20 Lily Kaise says, "Well to some extent. If they find multiple planets, then no, I probably won't manage it."

05:16:27 Lily Kaise grins.

05:16:32 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:16:37 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

05:16:59 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

05:18:10 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe on close approach received."

05:21:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:21:59 The computer begins a x-ray spectography program.

05:22:22 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

05:23:35 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm guess i'll hang out here until the planetary surveying is done so I'm going up to the Control room to join in on the elbo party."

05:23:35 A hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki skitters into the area.

05:23:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:23:45 You laugh.

05:23:47 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:23:47 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:23:51 I don't understand that.

05:23:53 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Command Ring; Starboard]

05:23:53 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You can go southwest and northwest.

05:23:56 Lily Kaise glides in from the southwest.

05:23:58 Lily Kaise glides northwest.

05:23:59 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Control Room]

05:23:59 You see a gray leather captain's chair, a white leather sofa, a black storage locker, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a white plastic box labeled 'Original Space Imager Images', and Manx the little calico CatBot here.
Melinda Michaels is sitting on a white leather sofa. Nissi Valdaire, Ather Jammoa, Vernos Bailey, Rogue Romano, Aisling the Fox, Eli Grey, and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go southeast, southwest, up, and out.
You hear the faint sounds of an external x-ray telescope shifting orientation.

05:23:59 Eli Grey nods to Ather Jammoa.

05:24:03 The planetary surveyor emits a series of quiet beeps, then continues working.

05:24:08 Eli says to Ather, "I know, but I like the safety net."

05:24:10 Eli Grey shrugs.

05:24:10 Ather Jammoa says, "You keep good records, you know how to use the NDB, and you can navigate perfectly fine."

05:24:14 Eli Grey nods to Ather Jammoa.

05:24:31 Ather says to Eli, "You can set up the galleon to set up one temp station."

05:24:36 Ather Jammoa says, "Just one, mind you."

05:24:36 Eli Grey says, "As long as your sensors aren't shit, you can always just use the things you've found as markers."

05:24:49 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

05:24:53 You nod.

05:24:59 You hear the faint sounds of an external x-ray telescope shifting orientation.

05:25:03 The planetary surveyor emits a series of quiet beeps, then continues working.

05:25:13 Eli Grey says, "That's how I used to do it anywyas."

05:25:21 Eli Grey says, "Just follow the breadcrumbs back home."

05:25:26 You grin.

05:25:29 Vernos Bailey says, "I know our president has his own plans but I really am hoping to see more exploration from AEU pilots."

05:25:50 Lily Kaise says, "The NDB is very useful too."

05:25:53 Ather Jammoa says, "Anyway, yeah, charting is a very nice safety net, but not nearly as necessary as people tend to think it is. Heck, Morris went on a jaunt, had me along for a safety net and managed to navigate home perfectly fine all by himself using the NDB and good record keeping."

05:25:59 Vernos Bailey says, "So much cool stuff out here."

05:25:59 A brightly colored x-ray spectrograph is slowly filled in on a nearby screen.

05:26:03 The planetary surveyor displays a handful of moving points of light which could be planets. Text alongside shows probable composition and mass.

05:26:06 Lily Kaise says, "We have as well."

05:26:21 Melinda Michaels says, "Sure, you just have to keep notes and use the NDB."

05:26:36 Ather Jammoa says, "I would also suggest trying to avoid storms."

05:26:44 Ather Jammoa says, "They're generally the most inconvenient drift factor."

05:26:46 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

05:26:49 You nod.

05:26:50 Melinda Michaels says, "I took them on an NDB class trip some time back. I told them Nissi and I weren't going to chart unless we absolutely had to do it."

05:26:59 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

05:27:03 The ship's surveying equipment has failed to find any new planets.

05:27:12 Nissi Valdaire says, "Dang."

05:27:12 Lily Kaise says, "I'm glad I have the detector it has been very useful."

05:27:12 You say, "No planets."

05:27:13 Vernos Bailey says, "No planets."

05:27:16 Ather Jammoa says, "Stupid dead star."

05:27:19 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

05:27:27 "So, late one night, they attempted to get Akemi to send them a hypercast while I slept." Melinda Michaels grins. "The only problem was, Akemi knew what I was doing and did not send."

05:27:33 Melinda Michaels laughs.

05:27:37 You chuckle.

05:27:40 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:27:43 Ather Jammoa says, "That's straight up laziness."

05:27:47 Lily Kaise waves.

05:27:53 Melinda Michaels says, "Aww."

05:27:59 Lily Kaise says, "With that I'll say good night."

05:28:07 You say, "I will as well."

05:28:10 You say, "Night all."

05:28:15 You wave.

You can go east.

05:28:31 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You two rest well."

05:28:33 You pull a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers off of your feet.

05:28:36 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Thanks."

05:28:40 You put down a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers.

05:28:47 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks and yo too when you do!"

05:28:53 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

05:28:55 Lily Kaise glides east.

05:28:58 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

05:42:59 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Urface."

05:43:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:44:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

05:44:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes."

06:32:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

07:14:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:20:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

08:14:57 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

08:15:07 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

08:15:08 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

08:15:09 The starship has left a unique area of space.

08:15:18 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

08:45:08 The ship comes to a sudden stop, and then is carefully passed from one ant to another, so it avoids getting caught in a web.

08:55:19 The ant in front of the ship missteps and gets caught in a sticky thread of webbing. It struggles in vain, only tangling itself further.

09:05:56 Several ants break away to engage a spider. The ship slowly moves past to avoid detection.

09:16:10 The ship comes to a sudden stop, and then is carefully passed from one ant to another, so it avoids getting caught in a web.

09:16:45 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

09:16:55 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

09:46:29 Lily Kaise lies back in a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

09:46:46 The neon green plastic plant barely moves in the calm water as a fish swims past it.

09:57:16 The neon green plastic plant barely moves in the calm water as a fish swims past it.

10:06:42 The lid on the treasure chest opens as bubbles begin to once again rise from it.

10:06:42 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

10:17:20 A small snail glides effortlessly across the inner surface of the glass.

10:18:24 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

10:18:34 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

10:33:11 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

10:38:02 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

10:38:48 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

10:48:26 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

10:58:56 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

10:59:55 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

11:10:44 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

11:20:53 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

11:21:24 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

11:21:34 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

11:29:32 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

11:51:25 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

12:02:24 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

12:12:25 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

12:22:32 You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.

12:22:36 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

12:22:46 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

12:52:37 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

13:02:53 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

13:13:23 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

13:23:36 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

13:24:28 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

13:24:38 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

13:54:29 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

13:59:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

14:02:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:04:52 A gust of wind blows through the ship, blowing strands of sticky silk like streamers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air, thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, a clear plastic food storage container, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of soft dark pink slippers here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go east.

15:23:53 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, 
15:23:53 both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.

15:28:20 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the neck.

15:29:31 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

15:29:41 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

16:10:00 The island passes through a thick, fluffy cloud, coating everything in a refreshingly cool mist, before it emerges on the other side.

16:16:16 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

16:16:19 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly into the area.

16:20:43 Vernos Bailey strolls in from the south.

16:29:08 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

16:29:38 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

16:29:48 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

16:33:19 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly west.

16:33:48 Rogue Romano slumps in a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow and goes to sleep.

17:08:33 You say to Lily Kaise, "Thanks."

17:08:37 You take a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:08:45 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

17:09:00 Rogue Romano suddenly awakens.

17:09:06 You take a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:09:09 You smile at Lily Kaise.

17:09:56 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

17:10:39 You take a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:10:41 You are carrying a cup of hot cafe mocha in your right hand.

17:10:44 You take a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:11:30 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

17:12:08 You finish off a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:12:12 You give a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

17:17:27 Vernos Bailey scrambles to his feet.

17:17:27 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

17:17:41 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alright quick nap."

17:17:47 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Rest well."

17:17:54 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:18:47 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

17:18:52 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

17:18:56 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

17:19:28 Lily Kaise says, "Woo we missed the storm but perhaps too bad as we could use the speed and distance."

17:20:10 You nod.

17:20:12 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

17:20:12 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

17:20:16 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic flower with purple petals.

17:20:17 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

17:20:25 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/All.

17:20:33 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

17:21:04 Emily Ford slinks in from the south.

17:21:06 Emily Ford slinks east.

17:21:17 Emily Ford slinks in from the east.

17:21:21 Emily Ford sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

17:21:27 You say to Emily Ford, "Hi."

17:21:31 Emily Ford smiles at you.

17:21:34 Emily Ford says, "Hi there."

17:21:40 You smile at Emily Ford.

17:21:54 Emily Ford takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

17:22:16 Melinda Michaels suddenly awakens.

17:22:23 You say to Melinda Michaels, "Hi."

17:22:25 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

17:22:28 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey."

17:22:37 Emily Ford says, "It's Melinda, so it must be bad."

17:22:39 Emily Ford nods.

17:22:42 Melinda Michaels says, "Probably."

17:22:50 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly into the area.

17:22:51 Emily hugs Melinda with her free arm.

17:23:09 Rogue Romano navigates her metallic yellow touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

17:23:10 Melinda Michaels examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

17:23:10 Melinda Michaels helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

17:23:11 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

17:23:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Well then."

17:23:26 Emily Ford asks, "Well then?"

17:23:30 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:23:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Coffee."

17:23:40 Emily Ford says, "Yes, it is."

17:23:40 You say, "Coffee is good."

17:23:53 Rogue Romano switches a metallic yellow touch einrophone off.

17:24:00 Emily says to Melinda, "Did you have to drink some before you knew what to call it?"

17:24:03 Emily Ford grins.

17:24:06 Melinda says to Emily, "Yup."

17:24:14 Rogue Romano turns on her metallic yellow touch einrophone and taps at it briefly.

17:24:15 You grin.

17:24:51 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/All.

17:25:01 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

17:25:01 Melinda Michaels strolls south.

Subject: It's All Over
Author: voyager1000
Posted: Sat Jun 17 15:20:24 2017 UTC

Hi everyone,
For those who don't know, I was approached by the police in December of 2014 and asked to testify in court.
The last two and a half years of waiting were some of the worst times I've experienced, then I was called on Monday and asked to travel, then give my evidence on Wednesday.
So it's finally all over. I've not said much as it's not the sort of thing I want to talk about, though the court experience was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.
I know some players here know little bits and pieces, and thanks to them for their support. To the rest of you, thank you for helping me stay sane. Well as sane as a Geordie can ever be.
The player of Emily.

I'm very glad for you. Court in general is just stressful, and so with that in mind, I hope you get to have some stress free times going forward

17:27:14 It costs 65,000,000.00 EAOS credits to continue this phone's plan. Are you ready to pay this?

17:27:14 [Enter `yes' or `no']

17:27:16 Your plan has been renewed!

17:27:38 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the east.

17:27:40 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

17:27:42 Melinda Michaels dangles a hot cheeseburger with the works in front of a Tardick lizard named Zeus. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, but it seems surprisingly uninterested. Perhaps it's actually full.

17:27:52 Melinda Michaels says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus, "Fine then."

17:27:58 Melinda Michaels gives a hot cheeseburger with the works to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

17:28:40 Emily Ford says, "Wasting cheeseburgers on lizards, how terrible."

17:28:43 Emily Ford takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

17:28:49 Melinda Michaels says, "I am a terrible person."

17:29:11 Emily Ford says, "Yes, you are. I trained you well."

17:29:16 Melinda Michaels grins.

17:29:20 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

17:29:48 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

17:29:58 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

17:30:08 Melinda Michaels says, "Giddyup."

17:30:22 Emily Ford says, "Fatal things can kill you, you know."

17:30:25 Emily Ford takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

17:30:29 Melinda Michaels asks, "Really?"

17:30:38 Emily Ford says, "Yeah."

17:30:48 Emily Ford says, "Don't worry, I'll keep on teaching you this stuff."

17:30:52 Emily Ford pats Melinda Michaels on the back.

17:31:05 Melinda Michaels grins. "Thank you so very much."

17:31:58 Emily Ford says, "Pleasure."

17:32:02 Emily nods sagely.

17:32:04 Emily Ford finishes off a glass of chilled orange juice.

17:32:09 Emily Ford gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

17:34:41 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

17:35:17 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:35:19 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

17:35:58 Melinda Michaels says, "I am glad we didn't stay in that calm very long.""

17:36:13 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/All.

17:37:01 Emily Ford asks, "What calm?"

17:37:52 Melinda Michaels says, "We hit a bit of a calm last night and into early this morning. Like the calm we go in once we hit the Spinward clan area."

17:38:33 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "The flow was under 2000 for quite a spell."

17:39:00 Emily Ford nods.

17:39:05 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:39:11 Emily Ford says, "Looks as if we're on the way home."

17:39:15 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

17:39:23 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

17:39:49 Melinda Michaels says, "We've got a ways to go though."

17:39:50 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

17:40:05 Emily Ford asks, "How far out did we go before turning around?"

17:40:25 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

17:40:26 Damien Goss steps east.

17:40:35 Damien Goss steps in from the east.

17:40:39 Damien Goss sits down.

17:40:43 Melinda Michaels says, "Maybe just shy of 2000, though we may have it it."

17:40:56 Emily Ford says, "It's always good to have it it."

17:41:00 Melinda Michaels laughs.

17:41:04 Damien Goss takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

17:41:11 Damien Goss asks, "What are you two talking about?"

17:41:14 Melinda Michaels says, "Let me reword this. We may have hit it."

17:41:19 Emily Ford grins.

17:41:23 Melinda Michaels says, "Our distance traveled."

17:41:30 Emily says to Damien, "I was asking how far we travelled before turning around."

17:41:36 Damien Goss says, "Oh, 1972 light years."

17:41:51 Melinda says to Damien, "Was that before we turned coreward?"

17:41:51 Emily Ford asks, "We didn't manage twenty-eight more?"

17:42:23 Damien Goss nods. "We turned cause the flow was completely against us or close enough that it would have taken many hours to reach the 2000 light year mark."

17:42:57 Melinda says to Damien, "We still went up after turning coreward so, probably 1980 light-years, give or take."

17:43:26 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:43:57 Damien Goss says, "Perhaps, I'm not sure how much vertical we travelled on the coreward heading, but we had just passed 1 LTC when we turned and we need about 5 to reach 2000."

17:44:10 Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders. "I think."

17:44:14 Melinda Michaels navigates her silver flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

17:44:15 Emily Ford says, "That's a shame, that happened on the first antispinward trip. We left Feng Wo with the intention of hitting a thousand, only to have the flow in our face."

17:44:16 Damien Goss shrugs.

17:44:45 Melinda Michaels says, "0 negative 30."

17:45:00 Damien Goss says, "And we did that for about 20 light years."

17:45:06 Melinda Michaels says, "3 ltc's."

17:45:12 Damien Goss nods.

17:45:24 Damien Goss says, "So yeah maybe 1980."

17:45:31 Damien Goss says, "Not much more than that though."

17:45:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Go me, no math even."

17:45:35 Melinda Michaels grins.

17:45:38 Damien Goss gives Melinda Michaels a thumbs up!

17:45:50 Melinda Michaels says, "I am learning to guess good."

17:46:00 Melinda Michaels finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

17:46:06 Damien Goss stands up.

17:46:07 Melinda Michaels gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

17:46:11 Damien Goss says, "I'll be right back."

17:46:11 Damien Goss steps south.

17:46:33 Emily Ford asks, "Are you enjoying yourself, Tegan?"

17:46:39 Emily Ford considers Tegan the small circular sanitation bot thoughtfully.

17:46:39 Damien Goss steps in from the south.

17:46:39 Damien Goss sits down.

17:47:47 Rogue Romano suddenly awakens.

17:48:17 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

17:48:24 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

17:48:24 Melinda Michaels strolls east.

17:49:18 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the east.

17:49:21 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

17:50:51 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

17:51:09 Emily Ford says, "I should have a nosy through the things I've missed."

17:51:12 Emily Ford sighs.

17:51:15 Emily Ford navigates her metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

17:51:44 Melinda Michaels says, "Yea."

17:53:18 Emily Ford switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

17:53:25 Emily Ford says, "Quite a bit of stuff there."

17:53:30 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

17:53:50 Emily Ford says, "At least I got to sit out of the way of noise and static."

17:53:54 Emily Ford smirks.

17:54:02 "You hid out huh?" Melinda Michaels grins.

17:54:16 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

17:56:17 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

17:56:28 Emily Ford says, "Not really hid, just felt like some time by myself."

17:59:49 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

18:01:50 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

18:01:51 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

18:03:26 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

18:03:29 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

18:03:33 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

18:04:16 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

18:06:16 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

18:07:53 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a cup of hot cafe mocha.

18:12:23 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

18:13:51 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

18:15:12 Eli Grey walks in from the south.

18:15:24 Eli Grey waves.

18:15:30 Rogue Romano smiles at Eli Grey. "Hi you."

18:15:33 Eli says to Emily, "Hey! Look who decided to join us!"

18:15:35 Emily Ford smiles at Eli Grey.

18:15:41 Eli Grey grins at Rogue Romano.

18:15:47 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

18:15:48 Emily Ford says, "I didn't know you were coming apart."

18:15:50 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

18:16:04 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, we just didn't know what to do without you Emily."

18:16:17 Eli Grey says, "We all just sat here staring at each other."

18:16:27 Damien Goss takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

18:16:36 Emily says to Eli, "Watch that believeability factor."

18:16:55 Eli Grey grins at Emily Ford.

18:17:15 Eli Grey says, "Ooh, looks like we got out of that low-flow zone."

18:19:04 Eli Grey stretches.

18:19:19 Eli Grey says, "Breakfast time."

18:19:20 Eli Grey walks east.

18:22:30 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

18:24:57 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

18:24:57 A black digital felo game beeps hungrily as the felo rapidly empties its food bowl.

18:25:07 Aisling the Fox presses a button on a black digital felo game.

18:25:07 A black digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

18:25:09 Aisling the Fox stretches.

18:25:18 Emily Ford knocks on Aisling the Fox's head.

18:25:20 Emily Ford says, "Bonk."

18:25:28 Aisling the Fox knocks on Emily Ford's head.

18:25:30 Aisling the Fox says, "Bonk."

18:25:55 Eli Grey walks in from the east.

18:26:03 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

18:26:05 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

18:26:16 Eli Grey says, "Oh wait."

18:26:17 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

18:26:17 Eli Grey walks east.

18:26:20 Eli Grey walks in from the east.

18:26:23 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

18:26:30 Eli Grey says, "That fridge is getting a little stinky."

18:27:04 Emily Ford scrambles to her feet.

18:27:04 Emily Ford slinks west.

18:27:06 Eli Grey takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

18:27:17 Emily Ford slinks in from the west.

18:27:20 Emily Ford nods.

18:27:21 Emily Ford sits down on a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

18:27:26 Eli Grey arches an eyebrow.

18:27:32 Eli Grey asks, "What's up?"

18:27:47 Emily Ford says, "Nothing, everything's good."

18:27:58 Eli Grey says, "Oh ok."

18:28:00 Eli Grey grins.

18:28:17 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

18:30:59 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

18:31:10 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

18:32:17 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

18:32:31 Eli says to Emily, "You feeling any better?"

18:32:35 Eli Grey takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

18:33:14 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

18:34:34 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

18:36:17 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

18:40:01 Eli Grey takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

18:41:42 Emily rubs her face, "Sorry, my mind wandered there a moment."

18:42:07 Eli Grey says, "Ah yeah. Thoughts. They happen to the best of us."

18:42:12 Eli Grey takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

18:43:52 Emily Ford says, "I do think sometimes."

18:45:11 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

18:45:50 Eli says to Rogue, "Not time for hot chocolate yet?"

18:45:55 Eli Grey finishes off a glass of chilled orange juice.

18:46:02 Eli Grey gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

18:46:07 Rogue says to Eli, "Nope, not yet."

18:46:10 Eli Grey grins.

18:46:16 Eli Grey takes a bite of a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

18:46:21 Emily Ford asks, "How do you define hot chocolate time?"

18:46:41 Rogue Romano says, "After soak in hot tub and before bed."

18:46:46 Emily Ford says, "Oh."

18:46:48 Emily Ford nods to Rogue Romano.

18:46:48 Eli Grey chuckles.

18:46:49 Rogue Romano nods.

18:46:51 Eli Grey says, "That checks out."

18:47:11 Emily Ford says, "Rogue's trying to give it up, she's down to twenty soaks a day."

18:47:21 Rogue Romano smirks.

18:47:37 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

18:50:17 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

18:52:17 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

18:52:37 Eli Grey grins.

18:52:41 Eli Grey finishes off a hot cheese and cheese biscuit with cheese.

18:53:06 Eli Grey says, "You know, more people would probably explore if they knew that part of it was hot tub time with attractive ladies."

18:53:16 Eli Grey examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

18:53:18 Eli Grey helps himself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

18:53:21 Rogue Romano smirks.

18:53:29 Damien Goss takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

18:54:20 Eli Grey says, "That would be another good recruitment poster. 'Join the Pilot CORPS and explore the galaxy!' with just people partying it up in a hot tub."

18:54:22 Emily Ford says, "I haven't actually used the tub at all, yet it was me who hoped to get one on our first long rift expedition."

18:54:29 Eli Grey grins at Emily Ford.

18:54:51 Emily Ford says, "You should petition the EAOS to fit a rift drive to a giant hot tub."

18:54:56 Eli Grey laughs.

18:58:33 Emily Ford says, "Perhaps we could ask Kelsey to tug the aquarium back to the Torus for us, then pay to have it refitted."

18:58:43 Emily Ford nods.

18:59:00 Eli Grey asks, "That place is huge isn't it?"

19:00:01 Emily Ford says, "It's big enough to be a station."

19:00:17 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

19:00:22 Eli Grey says, "Heh, tug it to the middle of the torus, and turn the Torus into one big hot tub."

19:00:39 Emily Ford says, "A donut with a hot tub, I like that."

19:01:00 Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.

19:02:00 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

19:04:28 You glance around at your surroundings.

19:04:30 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, and Manx the little calico CatBot here.
Aisling the Fox is sitting on a round saffron orange zafu. Rogue Romano is sitting on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow. Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow. Damien Goss is seated. Jason Rat, Ather Jammoa, Nissi Valdaire, and Melinda Michaels are dozing on a white leather sofa. Eli Grey is
19:04:30  sitting on a soft square brown floor cushion. Anfisa the Wanderer and Emily Ford are sitting on a white leather sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

19:04:35 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy printed on the chest and a pair of soft light blue slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly
19:04:35  labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a cup of hot cafe mocha in her left hand.

19:04:44 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

19:05:56 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

19:06:17 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

19:08:17 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

19:10:12 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:10:17 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

19:10:21 Eli Grey says, "Whee."

19:10:37 Eli Grey asks, "Wait.. chruning.. is that good?"

19:10:53 Eli Grey asks, "Trying to remember.. chruning is hte one that locks up the controls right?"

19:11:04 Emily Ford says, "Er, that's the one that throws you around, I believe."

19:11:15 Eli Grey wrinkles his nose.

19:11:21 Eli Grey shrugs.

19:12:39 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

19:12:52 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

19:13:52 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

19:14:38 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

19:14:38 A churning riftstorm appears to be 1.29 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Up and Slightly Northnortheast.

19:15:04 Lily Kaise slumps in a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe and goes to sleep.

19:18:22 Eli Grey says, "I wonder if this is the same ocean that we sometimes sail on."

19:18:26 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

19:18:52 Emily Ford says, "I don't want to step outside to find out how cold it is."

19:19:07 Eli Grey shivers.

19:19:25 Eli Grey says, "Yeah ti's all cold and crushy for sure."

19:23:12 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

19:23:28 Eli waves to the passing fish.

19:23:31 You exclaim, "Hi and bye little fishie!"

19:23:35 Eli Grey says, "It was an Eli fish."

19:23:38 Eli Grey grins.

19:23:40 You grin.

19:23:46 Rogue Romano grins.

19:23:52 Rogue Romano finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

19:23:58 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

19:24:09 Rogue Romano stands up from a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

19:24:11 Rogue Romano slinks east.

19:24:32 Rogue Romano slinks in from the east.

19:24:37 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

19:24:41 Rogue Romano carefully unwraps a meatball sandwich.

19:24:43 Rogue Romano picks up half of a meatball sandwich and takes a huge bite.

19:25:22 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

19:26:17 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

19:26:35 Eli Grey says, "Hmm..."

19:26:45 Emily Ford asks, "Hmm?"

19:26:47 Eli Grey asks, "That looks good, that a vending machine sandwich?"

19:26:51 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

19:27:06 Rogue Romano nods.

19:27:17 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

19:27:22 Eli Grey says, "Hmmm."

19:27:25 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

19:27:26 Eli Grey walks east.

19:27:30 Rogue Romano grins.

19:27:33 Rogue Romano takes another large bite of a meatball sandwich.

19:27:55 Emily says to Rogue, "What's the filling?"

19:28:17 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

19:28:38 Rogue says to Emily, "Meatball, maranara and parmesan."

19:29:26 Emily says to Rogue, "That sounds as if it should be over pasta, rather than between slices of bread."

19:29:27 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

19:29:31 Emily Ford chuckles.

19:29:36 Rogue Romano chuckles.

19:30:24 Eli Grey walks in from the east.

19:30:28 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

19:30:33 Eli Grey asks, "Is there a microwave?"

19:30:59 Emily Ford says, "I've not seen one, maybe Lily has a couple stashed away."

19:31:22 Rogue Romano says, "I haven't seen one either."

19:31:25 Eli Grey glances at Emily Ford.

19:31:32 Eli Grey asks, "A... couple? Of microwaves?"

19:31:40 Damien Goss stands up.

19:31:42 Damien Goss waves.

19:31:45 Eli Grey waves to Damien Goss.

19:31:46 Damien Goss steps south.

19:31:58 Emily flashes Eli an innocent look, "Yes, she's often prepared for practically anything."

19:32:43 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

19:32:54 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

19:32:57 Eli Grey says, "Hmm.."

19:33:05 Eli Grey exclaims, "Holy!"

19:33:09 Eli Grey says, "That gets me teverytime."

19:33:23 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

19:33:25 Eli hunkers down.

19:33:33 Eli Grey carefully unwraps a meatball sandwich.

19:33:36 Eli Grey picks up half of a meatball sandwich and takes a huge bite.

19:34:22 Eli Grey takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice and chilled vodka.

19:36:17 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

19:37:52 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

19:50:51 Rogue Romano finishes off half of a meatball sandwich.

19:54:17 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

19:56:09 Emily Ford glances down at her metallic tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

19:56:31 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

20:02:13 Eli Grey takes another large bite of a meatball sandwich.

20:02:25 Eli Grey takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice and chilled vodka.

20:02:41 Rogue Romano starts in on the second half of a meatball sandwich.

20:04:17 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

20:06:44 Eli Grey finishes off half of a meatball sandwich.

20:06:48 Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.

20:06:59 Rogue Romano takes another large bite of a meatball sandwich.

20:07:12 Rogue Romano finishes off the last of a meatball sandwich.

20:07:17 Rogue Romano crumples up her stained crinkled sandwich wrapper and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

20:07:22 Eli Grey says, "Damn you beat me."

20:07:23 Eli Grey starts in on the second half of a meatball sandwich.

20:07:27 Eli Grey takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice and chilled vodka.

20:07:28 Rogue Romano grins.

20:07:31 You grin.

20:07:58 Emily Ford says, "The galactic sandwich cramming contest was hotting up there for a while."

20:08:08 Rogue Romano laughs.

20:08:18 Eli Grey chuckles.

20:08:36 Eli Grey takes another large bite of a meatball sandwich.

20:08:59 Eli Grey finishes off the last of a meatball sandwich.

20:09:36 Eli Grey gives a stained crinkled sandwich wrapper to Ather Jammoa.

20:09:43 Eli Grey quickly drains a glass of chilled orange juice and chilled vodka.

20:10:00 Emily Ford says, "The confusion of robots."

20:14:28 Eli Grey says, "Here we go...."

20:14:39 Eli Grey gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

20:14:56 Eli Grey removes a charcoal gray hyperspanner from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

20:15:21 Emily Ford asks, "What are you going to repair?"

20:17:29 There is a momentary pause from the gunfire and then the shooting resumes.

20:22:14 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

20:22:47 Lily Kaise says, "Oh joy a churning storm."

20:22:47 You smile at Lily Kaise.

20:22:53 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

20:23:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

20:23:03 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

20:23:31 Melinda Michaels slumps in a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it and goes to sleep.

20:24:00 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

20:24:03 Morris Corlew waves.

20:24:05 You wave to Morris Corlew.

20:24:06 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

20:24:10 Lily Kaise waves to Morris Corlew.

20:24:12 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:24:17 Rogue Romano waves to Morris Corlew. "Yo."

20:24:18 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

20:26:17 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

20:26:35 There appear to be about 10 pilots recently active.

20:26:35 The starship's computer and QE comm detect:
*Lily Kaise  (A)
*Eli Grey  (A)
*Shule Elemmire  (A) [m]
*Emily Ford  (L)
*Damien Goss  (L)
*Morris Corlew  (L)
%Erik Goodwin  (L)
%Caleb Davenport  (L)
%Ali Candan  (L)
*Rogue Romano  (F)

* == Out of communications range

% == Detected via Quantum Entanglement comm
Additionally, there are 13 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 23 pilots.

20:32:17 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

20:33:59 Melinda Michaels suddenly awakens.

20:34:21 Lily Kaise waves to Morris Corlew.

20:34:24 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

20:34:44 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh, we're gonna hit that storm."

20:34:51 Morris Corlew nods. "Looks that away."

20:34:58 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

20:35:04 Melinda Michaels says, "It may change our heading."

20:35:28 Lily Kaise says, "It's a magic space buss."

20:35:29 Emily Ford asks, "Isn't that the storm that has you bumping all over the place?"

20:35:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:35:36 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

20:35:39 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

20:35:41 Morris Corlew says, "That's the one that turns the dial for ya."

20:35:46 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

20:35:47 Emily Ford says, "Oh."

20:35:48 Lily Kaise says, "Definitely."

20:36:06 Melinda says to Emily, "These switch your heading. Strange storms teleport you."

20:36:19 Emily says to Lily, "Eli was looking for a microwave, do you have any tucked away?"

20:36:35 Lily Kaise waves and waves and waves. "Hmm sure."

20:36:36 Emily says to Melinda, "I was thinking of hte one where you get pushed back out of it."

20:36:39 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:36:41 Lily Kaise glides east.

20:36:47 Morris Corlew asks, "Phasing?"

20:36:51 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

20:36:54 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:37:07 Morris Corlew says, "I know those seem to kick ya out."

20:37:07 Lily Kaise says, "Ok there's one in the galley that I forgot to put in there when we started out."

20:37:16 Emily Ford says, "I don't recall, I just remember we kept getting thrown back out of it, like we were bouncing off the surface of it."

20:37:24 Melinda says to Emily, "Phasing, you kinda pick at the edges of those."

20:37:26 Morris Corlew says, "Ah. Probably phasing."

20:37:29 Emily Ford nods.

20:37:29 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:37:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

20:37:52 Lily says to Eli, "I put one in the Galley for ya."

20:37:53 Emily says to Eli, "There you go, you can warm up that sandwich you ate earlier."

20:37:57 Morris Corlew says, "It's still there but it's tossin ya deeper or shallower in the flow, so when it's shallower ya don't seem to be in it, even though your're still in the same place it is."

20:37:58 Lily Kaise grins.

20:38:01 You grin.

20:38:12 Emily Ford nods to Morris Corlew.

20:38:50 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

20:38:52 Morris Corlew says, "Couple of these unidentified ones'll do it too. That's part of why I think they're some kind of...mixed-type storm."

20:42:23 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:44:17 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

20:45:53 An orange digital felo game emits a sprightly beep as the felo wakes up.

20:46:18 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

20:47:16 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:47:19 Lily Kaise glides south.

20:50:44 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings. Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down. Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large white and strawberry r
20:50:44 ed paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, and Manx the little calico CatBot here.
Anfisa the Wanderer, Jason Rat, Ather Jammoa, and Nissi Valdaire are dozing on a white leather sofa. Aisling the Fox is dozing on a round saffron orange zafu. Melinda Michaels and Emily Ford are sitting on a white leather sofa. Rogue Romano is sitting on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow. Eli Grey is sitting on a soft square brown floor cushion. Morris Corlew is sitting on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

20:53:26 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

20:54:23 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:54:33 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

20:54:36 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:54:44 Lily Kaise finishes off a cup of hot cafe mocha.

20:54:50 Lily Kaise gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

20:54:52 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

20:54:56 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

20:55:00 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

20:55:02 Aisling the Fox slumps in a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap and goes to sleep.

20:55:14 You smile at Lily Kaise.

21:04:18 A small semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with purple petals.

21:05:37 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it flashes past a viewport overhead.

21:07:23 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:08:50 Nissi Valdaire navigates her metallic purple swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

21:09:04 Nissi Valdaire switches a metallic purple swivel einrophone off.

21:09:29 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:09:33 Eli Grey says, "I thought for sure we would have hit htat storm before now."

21:09:39 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

21:09:39 A readout shows Planetary System 9482-5677 about 10.25 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northeast.
A churning riftstorm appears to be 5.7 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic North and Slightly Up.

21:09:41 Morris Corlew says, "Planets."

21:09:42 Eli Grey says, "Ooh."

21:09:44 Jason Rat says, "Woo."

21:09:46 Eli Grey stands up from a soft square brown floor cushion.

21:09:49 Eli Grey asks, "Mind if I get it?"

21:09:50 You exclaim, "Planets!"

21:09:51 Eli Grey puts a charcoal gray hyperspanner in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

21:09:53 You cheer.

21:09:56 Melinda Michaels points at you.

21:09:59 Eli Grey says, "Oh."

21:10:00 Melinda Michaels says, "They haven't yet."

21:10:01 Eli Grey nods to you.

21:10:05 Eli Grey sits down on a soft square brown floor cushion.

21:10:05 Melinda Michaels points at Lily Kaise.

21:10:19 Emily Ford says, "We'll probably need to steer around this storm or we'll never get there."

21:10:20 Lily Kaise says, "I would love for Shule to get it."

21:10:34 Eli Grey says, "Shouldn't be too hard, we're getting close to it though."

21:10:43 Eli Grey cheers for you!

21:11:46 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

21:11:47 Morris Corlew lopes east.

21:11:51 Morris Corlew lopes in from the east.

21:11:55 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

21:11:58 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

21:12:47 Eli Grey says, "I'm going to at least go face us away from the storm till her gets up there."

21:12:49 Morris Corlew says, "Well the storm is moving away."

21:12:52 Eli Grey says, "Oh."

21:13:35 Melinda says to you, "You gonna get these planets?"

21:13:56 Eli says to Lily, "Why don't you go for it until he can make it up there?"

21:14:02 Eli Grey shrugs.

21:14:37 Melinda Michaels examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

21:14:52 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

21:15:06 Melinda Michaels examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

21:15:10 Melinda Michaels helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

21:15:51 "Oh well guess Shule doesn't want to." Lily Kaise grins. "Let someone else do it though and Eli you've done a bunch."

21:15:56 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

21:15:58 Eli Grey nods.

21:16:01 Eli Grey says, "I've done plenty."

21:16:16 Jason Rat stands up from a white leather sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it.

21:16:17 Jason Rat jogs south.

21:16:20 Eli Grey says, "There we go."

21:16:20 Lily Kaise cheers.

21:16:32 Emily Ford says, "Our resident sprinter gets it."

21:16:38 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

21:16:39 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

21:16:44 Eli Grey says into the PA microphone, "Rock out with your dock out!"

21:16:52 Morris Corlew asks, "With his what?"

21:16:57 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is that what it's called?"

21:17:09 Eli Grey laughs. "Dock."

21:17:21 Eli Grey asks, "Because you know.. he's gonna dock us into the system?"

21:17:24 Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

21:17:24 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And I suck at this rift stuff, so please forgive me. Or don't. Who cares if you care because only I care."

21:17:35 Morris Corlew says, "Dock us into...ok..."

21:17:53 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

21:18:18 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

21:18:47 Rogue Romano examines a small hot beverage dispenser for a moment.

21:18:49 Rogue Romano helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

21:18:52 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

21:19:32 Eli Grey says, "Anybody's welcome to come take over anytime I'm up there. I don't mean to jump in front of anyone. Just eager to pull my weight."

21:19:37 Eli Grey grins.

21:21:26 Rogue Romano grins.

21:21:31 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

21:21:58 Emily Ford asks, "I don't mind pulling my weight, are we close to charging or repairing the drive?"

21:22:07 Morris Corlew grins at Emily Ford.

21:22:12 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You guys? We have 69 percent of our charge left. Please crack up and laugh because I said 69. Thank you."

21:22:18 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

21:22:32 Eli Grey says into the PA microphone, "The hottest of all charges."

21:22:50 Emily Ford says into the PA microphone, "And I literally just asked about charge... thanks."

21:23:30 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You're mighty welcome."

21:23:41 Emily Ford says into the PA microphone, "That's the power of the jelly."

21:23:45 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he cheers.

21:24:11 Jason Rat's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We are arriving the distance in which rift the location will keep moving."

21:24:16 Eli Grey asks, "Jelly?"

21:24:22 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

21:24:29 Morris says to Eli, "He wears jelly sandals."

21:24:40 Eli Grey says, "Oh the sandals."

21:24:41 Eli Grey nods.

21:24:55 Rogue Romano says, "Yup, and pink."

21:24:57 Eli Grey says, "That's way off from what I was thinking."

21:25:05 Morris Corlew looks at Eli Grey thoughtfully.

21:25:19 Eli Grey says, "I thought it was some sort of psychic jelly you rub on your forehead so you can transmit thoughts to each other."

21:25:28 Rogue Romano grins.

21:25:30 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

21:25:32 Morris Corlew chuckles. "Nope."

21:25:38 Eli Grey says, "Hey, I've heard stranger things on this trip."

21:25:40 Eli Grey chuckles.

21:26:44 Aisling the Fox suddenly awakens.

21:26:48 Rogue Romano asks, "Stranger things?"

21:26:48 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

21:27:06 Eli Grey shrugs.

21:27:12 Eli Grey says, "Yep, stranger things."

21:27:12 Rogue Romano grins.

21:27:27 Emily Ford says, "I can't believe that any pilot on this ship would say or act in any sort of strange way."

21:27:30 Emily Ford glances around at her surroundings.

21:27:46 Rogue Romano says, "Nah, not me."

21:27:54 Eli Grey smirks.

21:27:59 Aisling the Fox knocks on Emily Ford's head.

21:28:02 Aisling the Fox says, "Bonk."

21:28:07 Rogue says to Eli, "You don believe?"

21:28:15 Eli Grey says, "Well I mean Anfisa was a ship before. Like was aship."

21:28:18 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of frilly yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

21:28:49 Eli says to Rogue, "Nope, because I'm here so it can't be true."

21:28:52 Eli Grey laughs.

21:28:53 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

21:28:58 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

21:28:59 Rogue Romano smirks at Eli Grey.

21:28:59 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Fore]

21:28:59 You see a hairy dark yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Tiki here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

21:29:01 You can't go that way.

21:29:02 You can't go that way.

21:29:03 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

21:29:03 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
You can go east.

21:29:06 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

21:29:07 You blink heavily and then doze off.

21:29:50 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

21:30:17 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

21:30:41 I don't understand that.

21:30:52 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

21:30:52 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

21:30:55 You don't feel very sleepy at the moment.

21:31:17 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

21:31:32 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You can do it!"

21:31:46 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

21:31:46 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

21:31:48 You don't feel very sleepy at the moment.

21:31:51 You don't feel very sleepy at the moment.

21:32:01 You don't feel very sleepy at the moment.

21:32:03 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

22:27:08 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash bin, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
You can go east.
(You are lying on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.)

22:28:12 Use what?

22:28:15 A leather briefcase is already open.

22:28:18 I see no "despenser" here.

22:28:23 You remove a silver plastic paper dispenser from a leather briefcase.

22:28:26 You examine a silver plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

22:28:27 What would you like?

22:28:35 You make a selection on a silver plastic paper dispenser, and a sheet of yellow paper slides out of the slot at the bottom into your waiting hand.

22:30:57 You blink heavily and then doze off.

22:38:36 You can't write a silver plastic paper dispenser.

22:38:42 You put a silver plastic paper dispenser in a leather briefcase.

22:38:44 You begin writing on a sheet of yellow paper.

22:38:54 --

22:38:54 Dearest Lily,
There are many things I will cherish regarding my pilot life. All of the experiences have taught me valuable lessons and helped me grow as a person. Above all, I will remember the time we spent together. However, I feel it's time for my career to come to a close.
Upon our return to beacon space, I will send in my resignation as GSL and will leave the pilot corps forever.
Thank you for being such a wonderful friend, confident, and most of all, lover. I wish and hope the best for you in your piloting career. I love you and you will always  hold a special place in my heart and there will never be another for me. Please keep the ring I gave you as a constant reminder of my love that will encircle you regardless of where you go. Take care and may your dreams carry you to the stars.
With Love,
Shule.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Quarters Deck; Fore]
This room leads to the living quarters, and contains some additional amenities, notably a tiny alcove containing a shower. A small keypad controls access to the living quarters. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

22:40:03 
[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Control Room]
The arc of the starship's command ring meets gracefully here in a sweeping, curved control room. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. A large navigation terminal has a direct hookup to the onboard navigation mainframe. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. A half-deck behind this control area allows other crew members to gather and observe. Every surface is a pristine cream color. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a gray leather captain's chair, a white leather sofa, a black storage locker, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a white plastic box labeled 'Original Space Imager Images', and Manx the little calico CatBot here.
Lily Kaise, Eli Grey, Melinda Michaels, Aisling the Fox, Nissi Valdaire, Emily Ford, and Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec are standing here.
You can go southeast, southwest, up, and out.
