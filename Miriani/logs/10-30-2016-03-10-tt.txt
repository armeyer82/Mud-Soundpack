-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named
Nellie, an insulated orange cooler, a small white trash bin, a compact red
refrigerator, a high tech silver star print holovid, a pocket-sized purple
holovid, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated blue cooler,
Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

finally gave in and went and got medical for my arm."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's not healthy..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean the two weeks part, not
the fact you went to medical."
[General Communication] A blue winged fish transmits, "Well it wasn't to bad, it
just became annoying."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, that being said, I left
in a hurry once right after Nemesis gave me a nice little love tap and so wore
the bruise for a month..."
[General Communication] A blue winged fish transmits, "About a month ago I got
into a fight with a washing machine, and of course I lost. I finally got the
bruise taken care of three weeks later."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "Ah yeah, washing machines
aren't good to fight with..."

of that stuff down in my ship. No more shall I use public machines."

points?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Apparently you have broken the laws of
the squidgod somehow..."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "You've probably been penalized. Check
your point read out in a point center."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Check your points at a point center. It
will list what you did there. Probably some policy violation."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "That should provide information to which
policy you violated."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "For future reference, the POLICY command
can be very helpful to learn how to prevent it in the future."

it now."
Jewel the large violet glowing felo wanders in from the north.
[Newbie Help] Vlad Legian transmits, "So apparently I used a trigger that was
not allowed and got a penalty. Is this permanent?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Don't use triggers, read the policy on
automation very carefully."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "The penalty will stick on your record, but
you can make up the points they penalized you and get back on track."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Just follow the rules and you'll be able
to go on and do well."
[Newbie Help] Vlad Legian transmits, "Yeah, I didn't know the policy was that
strict. Wasn't botting or anything. Lesson learned. Do the penalty points count
towards caps or anything?"
Jewel the large violet glowing felo bats at a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'm not sure how exactly they interact
with caps. I assume the cap follows its usual rules though. You could ask on
MTTS or file a ticket to get an answer from a host. They would be able to tell
you."
[Newbie Help] Vlad Legian transmits, "Alright, thank you."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "I doubt the docked points are kept toward
your cap. It's a good idea to ask to be certain."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

found rats!"
[General Communication] Elizabeth Beckman transmits, "Bonus combat."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Do they leave after I leave
the sector, or they will stay there forever."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "They wander away in search of
new material in time."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If you want to do a beacon in
your rental, move to another sector that is adjacent. They won't all have RATS."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "The ships are there already,
for my beacon."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If you have already launched the
beacon and there are RATS in the sector, you will not get credit for it."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "And if I launched another one
somewhere else, it's fine?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yeah, once the timer between
beacons is up."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "What time."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Like I just launched now, then
found rats, and they are heavies, so I won't be able to take them all. What can
I do."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Let the enemies fight the RATS,
then destroy the enemies. Then launch your other beacon. That's probably the
fastest way to deal with it."
Jewel the large violet glowing felo wanders out.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Otherwise you have to wait for
the beacon to end on its own."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Oh, ok."

takes."

way too."

eaten by a debris monster."

alter-ego you made."

that act, but it was also rather fun."

soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it.
Lily Kaise glides out.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not really."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Take it to a capital space port, those
charge faster."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Go to one of the capital planets.
They charge you almost instantly. Other places have trickle chargers, which take
longer."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "Depends on where you land. Capitol
planets are near instant recharges. Lesser stations take longer depending on
their importance or logical ability."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Some places won't charge at all..."
[Newbie Help] Vlad Legian transmits, "But capitals recharge instantly. Go
there."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you don't have enough charge to get
there however, you might buy a charge booster or two or ten."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander chuckles. "One or two should suffice."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Seriously, yes. If you don't have enough
charge to get somwhere with a faster charger, buy a couple charge boosters.
That'll give you a little charge instantly, but I don't recall the percentage
off hand, and it might differ for different ships and batteries, too. That makes
me wish this was an ic conversation..."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Can I just go 2 west of the
BAS?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure, why not?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "It'll give you enough to get to a place
like Earthgate, which is usually all you need when you're in that situation."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Unless there's an active
beacon there of course."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Thought it's only one sector
around."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, thanks."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Three east and four up is the
best payout..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "How far -can- ya go from
the BAS before ya lose payout?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That, I'm not sure. But I know
two west works just fine."
[General Communication] Vlad Legian transmits, "What's BAS?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's the Battle Analysis
Scanner."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Don't repeat the crazy joke like
it's serious, Morris!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Now I thought he could hear
the tone in my voice..."
[General Communication] Vlad Legian transmits, "What does that do?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Basically monitors our
beacons, sends info back home."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "We get paid extra for the
trouble."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Technically you can set off a
beacon in a lot of places, but the best payout is when we send back intel."
Jewel the large violet glowing felo wanders out.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Do not set off beacons in
Mutuality space. Ever."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why I said in a lot of
places..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But yes, unless you have an
extinction wish, and if you do, please tell us about it right now...do not ever,
ever, ever set off a beacon in Mutuality space."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "It seems the robot still
effective."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If you have an extinction wish,
go play in traffic or something."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "That's not the robot
talking...that's appealing to your sense of loyalty to the human race and your
drive to continue living."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It wouldn't be me that would
make you...and the rest of humanity extinct if you did that."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a dusky pink rattan
cabinet, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple
and light purple cloth rug, a small seashell pink trash can, a small red ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and a small oval turquoise rattan
table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole
drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a fuzzy stuffed bear, and a decoy

l
[Starship "Supernova"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.
You see an overstuffed black chair, a transparisteel storage case, and an

[Starship "Supernova"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

#read sc.tin
#OK:   1 ACTION LOADED.
#help action
Command: #action {search string} {commands} {priority}

         Have tintin search for a certain string of text from the mud, if the
         string is found it will execute the commands.  Variables %1 to %99
         are substituted from the input string, and can be used in the command.

         If the search string starts with ~, color codes must be matched, which
         you can see by enabling: #config {convert meta} on.

         The following Perl compatible regular expression options are available:

       ^ force match of start of line.
       $ force match of end of line.
  %1-%99 lazy match of any text, available at %1-%99.
      %0 should be avoided in triggers, and if left alone lists all matches.
     { } embed a raw regular expression, available at %1-%99 + 1.
         [ ] . + | ( ) ? * are treated as normal text unlessed used within
         braces. Keep in mind that { } is replaced with ( ) automatically.

         Of the following the (lazy) match is available at %1-%99 + 1

      %w match zero to any number of letters.
      %W match zero to any number of non letters.
      %d match zero to any number of digits.
      %D match zero to any number of non digits.
      %s match zero to any number of spaces.
      %S match zero to any number of non spaces.

      %? match zero or one character.
      %. match one character.
      %+ match one to any number of characters.
      %* match zero to any number of characters.

      %i matching becomes case insensitive.
      %I matching becomes case sensitive (default).

         Actions can be triggered by the showme command.

Example: #act {^You are hungry$} {get bread backpack;eat bread}
         Performs 2 commands as you get the hunger message, tintin will not
         be fooled by someone saying 'You are hungry'.

Example: #act {%1 tells you 'hello'} {tell %1 Hello %1. How are you today?}
         This allows you to seem like a nice, attentive, fast typing gentleman.

Example: #act {A puppy barks at you, wagging {his|her|its} tail.} {pat puppy}
         This allows you to be nice to puppies regardless of their sex.

Comment: You can remove an action with the #unaction command.
