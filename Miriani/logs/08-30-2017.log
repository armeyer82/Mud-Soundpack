15:56 ["Starlight Express" Living Quarters 1] (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

15:56 [08/30/17 - 3:19 a.m.] Announcement: Hello, night players! For really exciting maintenance reasons, we need to reboot the server. Please get to a safe location to avoid getting kidnapped and/or destroyed. Shutdown will be around 3:30 AM (8/30/17). Downtime isn't expected to last more than 10 minutes, but we could get really unlucky. Thanks for understanding!
