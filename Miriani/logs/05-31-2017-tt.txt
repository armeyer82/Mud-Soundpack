-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic
felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a compact
red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage
container, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Prissy the big violet
long-haired felo here.

Recent Major Changes:
-----
2017 Exploration Revision
We have revised planetary surveying and space imaging and added a new
progression of equipment to these activities. The purpose of this is to make the
benefits of exploration less frontloaded while adding to the sense that
exploration crews are making new discoveries and doing important work.
 - Let's start with the bad news. Planetary surveying and space imaging as you
know them are now just preliminary work and will reward you less than before.
 - A range of spectroscopes and other more sci-fi scanners have been added as
follow-on work to space imaging. Each type of scan you perform increases the
value of the data you will bring home.
 - Planetary surveying now actually generates complete planetary systems.
 - The ship's computer will now let you perform field triangulations to jump
your ship into orbit over newly discovered planets.
 - Probes of various types have been added, deployable for close approaches,
extended observations, and planetary landings. Probes are additional follow-on
work after imaging points of interest, as well as follow-on work to planetary
surveying.
 - Existing points of interest have been retroactively flagged as if the new
data has already been gathered, since they have already paid out under the old
structure. The onboard library upgrade will reflect this.
 - Exploration ships now possess surveying databanks to hold all of this data,
which can be extended with new upgrades.
 - A Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying help file has been added to explain
the new activities and equipment.
As with any new addition, expect minor adjustments to occur for a little while
until we feel the system is in a balanced state. Future plans for expansion
include exploring the surface of new planets!

Recent Minor Changes:
-----
New profiles now require a short character concept to be written first.
   Posted 6 days, 2 hours, 35 minutes, and 16 seconds ago
-----
Cadet point caps have been adjusted. The limit in each category for those
without an approved concept is 100. The limit for those with a concept but no
profile is 250.
   Posted 6 days, 2 hours, 16 minutes, and 48 seconds ago
-----
Old space features (oort clouds, asteroid clusters, systems, etc.) will now be
purged periodically. The purged features are algorithmically determined to be of
little relevance, so ideally you won't notice much of a difference. Let us know
if you do!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

help surveying
--
Star Conquest Help: Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying
--
Category: Activities
--
This help file describes various scientific tasks you can perform on points of
interest you find in deep space. Points of interest can be nearly anything --
asteroid clusters, nebulas, star systems, and more! You will find these objects
at intervals when exploring in deep space, and your first step is to simply
approach them and have your ship arrive within the area of interest. After that,
there are several things you can do, depending on your ship's equipment, to
study the object. The data you bring back home is likely to be very valuable!
IMAGING, SPECTROSCOPY, AND ANALYZING
Space imaging is described in detail in the Space Imaging help file.
Once your starship has space imaging equipment, it can be augmented with a
series of spectroscopes and scanners sold by Central Stellar Cartography at the
main location on The Torus. The command to begin using this equipment is
SPECTROSCOPE. Once started, the computer will iterate through all of the
analysis equipment it has available. If you wish, the scan can be aborted by
repeating the command. The data gathered will be stored in the ship's surveying
databanks -- more on this below!
PLANETARY SURVEYING
Certain points of interests will be planetary systems! Exoplanets are of
particular interest to scientists back home and are always an exciting find.
The first step, if your ship has the necessary planetary surveyor, is to use the
SURVEY command. This will begin a series of scans that will eventually locate
and plot the orbits of all planets in the system.
Once the planets are found, you can use the JUMP command to have your ship
perform a field triangulation and travel via wormhole to your newly discovered
planets! However, this is where your advancement of scientific understanding
ends... unless, of course, you also have probes aboard, as detailed in the next
section!
PROBES AND LANDERS
If you have enough points, you may purchase a probe launcher from Central
Stellar Cartography. It can then be loaded with probes at any CSC branch using
the usual MENU and BUY commands. If you find you have too many of a particular
type of probe, you can unload them for some of your money back using the SELL
command.
Probes are used to study points of interest as well as individual planets. Each
probe can be deployed using one of three programs: close approach, extended
observation, or lander. A close approach probe is simply fired directly at an
object and transmits telemetry for as long as it can, often right up until it
impacts. An extended observation probe orbits or holds station near an object
for at least several hours, gathering much more information. And a lander will
gather information about the surface of a planet.
You do not need to stay and wait for a probe to complete a lengthy observation.
If you return to the site at any time after a probe has completed its program,
it will transmit the data to your ship within a minute or so. Since both probes
and time are limited, it is a good idea to save them for particularly worthy
targets, like green planets or exotic objects.
DISCOVERER CREDIT
Discoverers are the first people to image, survey, scan, or probe a new point of
interest and will be accorded a certain special status forever. If you cannot
complete all possible tasks at a point of interest, then any future followup
work will still be credited to any qualifying discoverers, even if they are not
on the new crew.
Uncertain if you're the first one to visit an area, or which studies have
already been performed? Be sure to get the CSC's onboard library upgrade and use
the LIBRARY command!
DATABANKS
Images are physical hardcopies and planetary surveys are stored in the ship's
main databanks, but all other data is stored on special surveying databanks.
These databanks have a limited capacity depending on the type of ship, which can
be viewed with the DATABANKS command. This capacity can be extended with
upgrades.
CREDITS FOR DATA
Surveying data can be transferred to any Central Stellar Cartography branch
using the SUBMIT command. Crew members must individually submit their planets,
but only the ship's owner can submit the contents of its databanks. Once the
data is processed, each member will be mailed their reward and given the
appropriate points.

Recent Major Changes:

2017 Exploration Revision
We have revised planetary surveying and space imaging and added a new
progression of equipment to these activities. The purpose of this is to make the
benefits of exploration less frontloaded while adding to the sense that
exploration crews are making new discoveries and doing important work.
 - Let's start with the bad news. Planetary surveying and space imaging as you
know them are now just preliminary work and will reward you less than before.
 - A range of spectroscopes and other more sci-fi scanners have been added as
follow-on work to space imaging. Each type of scan you perform increases the
value of the data you will bring home.
 - Planetary surveying now actually generates complete planetary systems.
 - The ship's computer will now let you perform field triangulations to jump
your ship into orbit over newly discovered planets.
 - Probes of various types have been added, deployable for close approaches,
extended observations, and planetary landings. Probes are additional follow-on
work after imaging points of interest, as well as follow-on work to planetary
surveying.
 - Existing points of interest have been retroactively flagged as if the new
data has already been gathered, since they have already paid out under the old
structure. The onboard library upgrade will reflect this.
 - Exploration ships now possess surveying databanks to hold all of this data,
which can be extended with new upgrades.
 - A Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying help file has been added to explain
the new activities and equipment.
As with any new addition, expect minor adjustments to occur for a little while
until we feel the system is in a balanced state. Future plans for expansion
include exploring the surface of new planets!

Recent Minor Changes:
-----
New profiles now require a short character concept to be written first.
   Posted 6 days, 3 hours, 56 minutes, and 19 seconds ago
-----
Cadet point caps have been adjusted. The limit in each category for those
without an approved concept is 100. The limit for those with a concept but no
profile is 250.
   Posted 6 days, 3 hours, 37 minutes, and 51 seconds ago
-----
Old space features (oort clouds, asteroid clusters, systems, etc.) will now be
purged periodically. The purged features are algorithmically determined to be of
little relevance, so ideally you won't notice much of a difference. Let us know
if you do!

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Delta.

Recent Major Changes:

2017 Exploration Revision
We have revised planetary surveying and space imaging and added a new
progression of equipment to these activities. The purpose of this is to make the
benefits of exploration less frontloaded while adding to the sense that
exploration crews are making new discoveries and doing important work.
 - Let's start with the bad news. Planetary surveying and space imaging as you
know them are now just preliminary work and will reward you less than before.
 - A range of spectroscopes and other more sci-fi scanners have been added as
follow-on work to space imaging. Each type of scan you perform increases the
value of the data you will bring home.
 - Planetary surveying now actually generates complete planetary systems.
 - The ship's computer will now let you perform field triangulations to jump
your ship into orbit over newly discovered planets.
 - Probes of various types have been added, deployable for close approaches,
extended observations, and planetary landings. Probes are additional follow-on
work after imaging points of interest, as well as follow-on work to planetary
surveying.
 - Existing points of interest have been retroactively flagged as if the new
data has already been gathered, since they have already paid out under the old
structure. The onboard library upgrade will reflect this.
 - Exploration ships now possess surveying databanks to hold all of this data,
which can be extended with new upgrades.
 - A Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying help file has been added to explain
the new activities and equipment.
As with any new addition, expect minor adjustments to occur for a little while
until we feel the system is in a balanced state. Future plans for expansion
include exploring the surface of new planets!

Recent Minor Changes:
-----
New profiles now require a short character concept to be written first.
   Posted 6 days, 4 hours, 16 minutes, and 8 seconds ago
-----
Cadet point caps have been adjusted. The limit in each category for those
without an approved concept is 100. The limit for those with a concept but no
profile is 250.
   Posted 6 days, 3 hours, 57 minutes, and 40 seconds ago
-----
Old space features (oort clouds, asteroid clusters, systems, etc.) will now be
purged periodically. The purged features are algorithmically determined to be of
little relevance, so ideally you won't notice much of a difference. Let us know
if you do!

Star Conquest Help: Spectroscopy, Analysis, and Surveying
--
Category: Activities
--
This help file describes various scientific tasks you can perform on points of
interest you find in deep space. Points of interest can be nearly anything --
asteroid clusters, nebulas, star systems, and more! You will find these objects
at intervals when exploring in deep space, and your first step is to simply
approach them and have your ship arrive within the area of interest. After that,
there are several things you can do, depending on your ship's equipment, to
study the object. The data you bring back home is likely to be very valuable!
IMAGING, SPECTROSCOPY, AND ANALYZING
Space imaging is described in detail in the Space Imaging help file.
Once your starship has space imaging equipment, it can be augmented with a
series of spectroscopes and scanners sold by Central Stellar Cartography at the
main location on The Torus. The command to begin using this equipment is
SPECTROSCOPE. Once started, the computer will iterate through all of the
analysis equipment it has available. If you wish, the scan can be aborted by
repeating the command. The data gathered will be stored in the ship's surveying
databanks -- more on this below!
PLANETARY SURVEYING
Certain points of interests will be planetary systems! Exoplanets are of
particular interest to scientists back home and are always an exciting find.
The first step, if your ship has the necessary planetary surveyor, is to use the
SURVEY command. This will begin a series of scans that will eventually locate
and plot the orbits of all planets in the system.
Once the planets are found, you can use the JUMP command to have your ship
perform a field triangulation and travel via wormhole to your newly discovered
planets! However, this is where your advancement of scientific understanding
ends... unless, of course, you also have probes aboard, as detailed in the next
section!
PROBES AND LANDERS
If you have enough points, you may purchase a probe launcher from Central
Stellar Cartography. It can then be loaded with probes at any CSC branch using
the usual MENU and BUY commands. If you find you have too many of a particular
type of probe, you can unload them for some of your money back using the SELL
command.
Probes are used to study points of interest as well as individual planets. Each
probe can be deployed using one of three programs: close approach, extended
observation, or lander. A close approach probe is simply fired directly at an
object and transmits telemetry for as long as it can, often right up until it
impacts. An extended observation probe orbits or holds station near an object
for at least several hours, gathering much more information. And a lander will
gather information about the surface of a planet.
You do not need to stay and wait for a probe to complete a lengthy observation.
If you return to the site at any time after a probe has completed its program,
it will transmit the data to your ship within a minute or so. Since both probes
and time are limited, it is a good idea to save them for particularly worthy
targets, like green planets or exotic objects.
DISCOVERER CREDIT
Discoverers are the first people to image, survey, scan, or probe a new point of
interest and will be accorded a certain special status forever. If you cannot
complete all possible tasks at a point of interest, then any future followup
work will still be credited to any qualifying discoverers, even if they are not
on the new crew.
Uncertain if you're the first one to visit an area, or which studies have
already been performed? Be sure to get the CSC's onboard library upgrade and use
the LIBRARY command!
DATABANKS
Images are physical hardcopies and planetary surveys are stored in the ship's
main databanks, but all other data is stored on special surveying databanks.
These databanks have a limited capacity depending on the type of ship, which can
be viewed with the DATABANKS command. This capacity can be extended with
upgrades.
CREDITS FOR DATA
Surveying data can be transferred to any Central Stellar Cartography branch
using the SUBMIT command. Crew members must individually submit their planets,
but only the ship's owner can submit the contents of its databanks. Once the
data is processed, each member will be mailed their reward and given the
appropriate points.

Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very
narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the
garage.

Angela Caesar
She appears to be 20 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is of average build with slightly curved hips and
pleasantly curved calves. She has slender shoulders and average-sized breasts.
Her face is long and girlish, with a wide nose and round chin. Her lips are
faintly downturned and pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white
teeth. Beneath a set of plucked eyebrows, her eyes are blue and wide. Her
mid-back length, wavy hair is dark blonde and drawn back in a ponytail. She has
neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a slender golden crown decorated with beautiful sparkling
jewels, a soft amethyst velvet top with a ruffled collar and short puffed
sleeves trimmed with shimmering gold braid, a silky fringed amethyst sash
embroidered with white roses, a pair of soft white velvet pants with a gold
harlequin print on the right leg, and a pair of amethyst heels decorated with
swirls of sparkling gold glitter. She is also wearing a keychain, a message
board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a charred metachannel FTL
communicator, a small cloth sack, a plain flat einrophone in a dark gray leather
phone holster, an indigo guitar case, a black flightbag, a white vinyl duffel
bag, and a compact metallic blue camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the
front with a glittery blue camera strap. Her face, both eyes, neck, both elbows,
both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a Caramel Fusion Bar in her left hand.
Angela Caesar takes a larger bite of a Caramel Fusion Bar. A strand of caramel
briefly dangles and then attaches itself stickily to her chin.

[Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a temporary wormhole drive, a fashionable matte black pod chair with a

[Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a temporary wormhole drive, a fashionable matte black pod chair with a
dark gray vinyl interior, a swiveling dark purple leather gunner's chair, and an
improved temporary wormhole drive here.
Joel Kringle is standing here.
You can go north and south.
(You are sitting on a fashionable matte black pod chair with a dark gray vinyl

[Starship "Love Hate Tragedy"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

Hey Love,
I have the awesomest! news for you. I had heard some little hints about an
expedition coming up and then Nissi invited Eli over the General channel
yesterday morning I think it was. I didn't say anything there but I wrote her a
letter and asked if she had room for us. It was just a humble little query as i
did feel a little awkward about inviting us. Still, perhaps others didn't know
that we would be interested.
The news is great! Nissi said there is room for us and we will be leaving at
midnight on monday. So be ready if I need to take you with me. We will be gone
for two weeks and I know if nissi planned this, it's going to be truly amazing!
We'll leave pets except for the lizie and guess we could take Higgins but I'll
just put enough food down for him. I probably will load up the fish on a hover
pallet and we just feed them every day if there's no room to put the tanks down.
Generally though, we can put them in the docking bay so that a robot can feed
them.
I love you,
Lily
