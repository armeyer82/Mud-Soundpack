00:14 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south.

00:17 you carefully place a bulky stun armor battery pack on a stun armor power pack recharging station, sliding it forward until the power couplings connect with a solid click.

00:17 A small green indicator light on a stun armor power pack recharging station blinks on, indicating that connected equipment is being charged.

00:18 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:18 You're already sitting down.

00:18 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

00:18 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:18 Ashley Valleris winks.

00:18 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:18 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:18 There is nothing to see.

00:18 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:18 > (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:18 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

00:18 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:18 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:18 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.
> (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

00:18 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:18 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

00:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

00:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:19 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

00:19 You should stand up first.

00:19 You stand up.

00:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

00:44 Combat Mission Notification Service
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
The combat mission notification service is an automated system designed to alert interested parties of upcoming combat missions. 
  Setting it Up
To begin using the service, you must establish a private communication link with it. You will first need to obtain a full communicator (see HELP COMMUNICATORS for more information). To establish the link, type: TR LINK MISSION. Once the link is established, you will be able to issue verbal commands to the service to change settings and get more information. To do that, you simply type: TR MISSION <command>
  Verbal Commands
You may transmit the following verbal commands:
  AUTO - Toggles automatic announcement of missions that you assign. 
  ANNOUNCE (send, go, notify, or simply transmit static) - Announces a combat mission for the ship you're currently in. 
  LIST (missions, dir) - Lists pending combat missions.
  HELP - Displays up-to-date command help.

00:51 Combat Mission Notification Service
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
The combat mission notification service is an automated system designed to alert interested parties of upcoming combat missions. 
  Setting it Up
To begin using the service, you must establish a private communication link with it. You will first need to obtain a full communicator (see HELP COMMUNICATORS for more information). To establish the link, type: TR LINK MISSION. Once the link is established, you will be able to issue verbal commands to the service to change settings and get more information. To do that, you simply type: TR MISSION <command>
  Verbal Commands
You may transmit the following verbal commands:
  AUTO - Toggles automatic announcement of missions that you assign. 
  ANNOUNCE (send, go, notify, or simply transmit static) - Announces a combat mission for the ship you're currently in. 
  LIST (missions, dir) - Lists pending combat missions.
  HELP - Displays up-to-date command help.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, an elegant turquoise gunner's chair, an elegant granite fountain with a stream of water flowing from the center of a rose, and a furry white Chihuahua with tiny ears and beady hazel eyes here.

12:12 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:12 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:12 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:12 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:12 The ship must be in space to do that.

12:12 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

12:12 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:12 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

12:12 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:12 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:12 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:12 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:12 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:12 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

12:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

12:12 You peer out and see...

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.

12:13 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.

12:40 Please be aware of the following basic guidelines for battlecruiser ownership:
* You must demonstrate the maturity to handle the ownership of such an advanced piece of technology. Monitors listen to the communicators and if you say that you are in league with the Praelor, are a child of a Praelor, have given birth to a Praelor, or otherwise have allegiances that conflict with those of the High Guard or your alliance, you will have your battlecruiser license revoked. Please note that this includes "renouncing" your alliance or the High Guard.
* You must use your battlecruiser in the defense of human space against targets the High Guard has deemed threatening, such as Praelor or rogue human pilots.
* Your battlecruiser rights will be revoked should you attack sectors 24 (High Guard Command) or 12 (Bellerophon), in any way, shape, or form. While the space station and Rolukssica base are equipped with defenses to deal with proximity weapons, blockades, and known enemy vessels, it is NOT there to clean up after irresponsible pilots. If you are found attempting to circumvent ANY defenses in High Guard space, your battlecruiser license will be revoked and may not be restored.
* Any action contrary to the goals of the High Guard, such as preventing combat missions, blockading the space station, blockading the mission jump gate, or otherwise interfering with High Guard operations is justification for the removal of these rights.
These are extremely basic guidelines. We will not attempt to spell out every specific situation, as it's your responsibility to make good decisions and judgement calls. By sending this application in, you are agreeing that your right to the battlecruiser class starship is at the sole discression of the joint committee for the regulation of advanced human war technoligies and may be revoked at any time for violating the above guidelines or in any situation the committee deems worthy of removal of these rights.
For more information on the battlecruiser testing process, please refer to message board post 13665.
You see some questions on an application for the ten-person battlecruiser...
1.) What is your name?
2.) How would you rate your combat abilities? Poor, average, excellent?
3.) Do you regularly participate in High Guard missions to protect known space?
4.) What would the primary purpose of a battlecruiser be in your fleet?
5.) What do you intend to name your battlecruiser?
6.) Imagine this hypothetical situation and describe how you would handle it. You're flying through uncharted space in your battlecruiser and you happen upon a lone Praelor starship. What do you do?
7.) Consider this situation: Praelor are invading known space and you find yourself on a planet with only two others. Your only option is to launch into a sector filled with Praelor who are probably swarming around the planet just waiting for you to launch. What do you do?
8.) Your friend has been kidnapped during an invasion
12:40  and is currently being held prisoner on someone else's ship. You have a full crew together, and you could easily retrieve your friend. Do you stay and fight the Praelor, or do you rescue your friend?
9.) You're being continually harassed over the communicator by someone. They aren't causing you any physical harm, just insulting you. One day, you're in your battlecruiser and you see him salvaging. Do you attack him?
10.) Have you ever operated a starship or any other vehicle under the influence of a drug such as alcohol?
11.) Have you ever committed an act of random violence against an innocent creature, such as a proboscis monkey?
12.) Are you willing to have your battlecruiser destroyed in the defense of humanity?
13.) And finally, you are free to make any additional comments here.

13:15 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south.

13:15 You peer out and see...

13:15 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the one-person fighter "Quack Attack" and the four-person surveyor "Ools Storage" powered down here.
You see Gee the droid, Larry the droid, Yelp the droid, Cyrax the droid, Cylinder the droid, Torri the droid, Ketemmex the droid, Ramzi the droid, Angela the droid, Gamma the droid, Nia the droid, Jade the droid, Shade the droid, and Giraffe the droid here.

13:32 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south.

15:17 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

20:42 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south.

A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

23:00 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The two-person vanguard "Fire And Ice" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

23:00 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fire And Ice, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:01 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:01 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:01 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:01 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:01 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:01 You press a large yellow button.

23:01 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.
The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:01 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:01 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:01 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

This lithe woman appears to be in her early twenties and stands 5 feet and 4 inches tall with a medium bust size. Her heart-shaped face bears a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a red rose in her long, champagne blonde hair, which is wavy. She has expressive sky blue eyes with an upturned nose above white, straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted a normal stance.
For a top, she is wearing a form-fitting black soft leather vest with fringe along the bottom. For a bottom, she is wearing a black mini skirt over a pair of black lace thong underwear. She is wearing a pair of black snake skin stiletto heels on her feet. She is wearing a white Swarovski Crystal belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a small keyring, a compact violet Lore computer, a black spacesuit storage bag, a fuzzy black backpack with black thin straps and a black heart-shaped front pocket, a violet ammunition container, a gold charm bracelet, a sparkling white Swarovski Crystal bracelet, a gold Alliance High Guard command charm on a long gold chain, a metallic gray metafrequency communication pin, a black archaeological artifact storage container, and a red rolled toolkit.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south, down, and out.

23:17 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

23:17 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

23:17 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:17 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

23:17 Current coordinates: 6, 12, 2

23:17 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:17 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:18 #$#soundpack_pong

23:18 #$#soundpack_lag 111

23:18 The starship is already moving.

23:18 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:18 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:18 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:18 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:18 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

23:18 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:18 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:18 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

23:18 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:18 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 3, 3, 3.

23:18 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:48 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the one-person fighter "Quack Attack", the five-person transverser "Astraeus' Odyssey", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Thanatos" landed here.
