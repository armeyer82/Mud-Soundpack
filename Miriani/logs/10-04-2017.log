Dear Tibo,
As for your predicament, I'm sorry that you can't manage the
Transverser out there. Now you know why that although I love that
ship, unless you have at least a crew of 4, that you really can't fight
major praelor without incurring a lot of damage because of how
difficult it is to multi-room. It's hard to manage ammunition too
because if you've only got a crew of one or two, then you'll rely too
much on bard and run out rather quickly. So this is why I prefer the
Gunship and with the Slip and Subwarp enhancements that I qualify for,
the speed of the ship is all but that of the Transverser with the
exception of not having waveqarp of course which is the Transverser's
crowning glory. I can outrun a lot in Mischief with Navi or anywhere
and of course it's a very solid ship. Still solo, even though I can
manage it pretty well, unless I have at least another crew, it's
vulnerable. Therefore, I'm not coming out to rescue you alone and I
don't want Valleris aboard any ship I own as I absolutely do not trust
her so she would be required to remain in your ship if I bring any ship
of mine to fetch your ship.
There are a couple of options I'll present which you probably won't
like. However, it's all that I can think of at the moment.
1. Escape with the individual you have aboard as grouped with you and
we can go back for your Transverser but she is not welcome.
2. If I could get the assistance of Cally and Mikey, we could bring
Mischief out to get your Transverser. I wouldn't expect either of them
to offer their Battlecruisers so it would be up to them. The issue
with this is I don't know what your trust level is with them at this
point as well as I am not certain if they will want to work with me to
rescue you given they aren't happy with how you treated me. The
converse is do you trust me enough to tell the Calaways. I was
thinking that when you let me know your galactic coordinates, that I
would try to not tell them directly until we were a number of sectors
out of FTL range. I do hope you know that you can trust me and that I
will never divulge where you are to anyone unless you explicitly tell me who you would trust knowing them.
3. As a last resort, you can self-destruct and return to comms and
work hard to recoup your losses. I personally would not like to see
this happen though.
Thank you for your letter. I so appreciate it that you've finally
apologized and much more. Since this comes as quite a shock, i'll be
honest and tell you that I don't know exactly how I feel at this time.
I'm certainly not trying to imply that I don't want to talk things
over. I've just been trying to shutdown emotionally. I can't tell you
that I don't miss you either and how I would prefer more than anything
that we are able to mend our relationship. I'm willing to try though.
Kitty

16:18 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovelyn: I need some help please. Purchased my starting ship, I'm at the garage but how do I enter my new ship?

16:18 [Newbie] Anny Rain: Enter.

16:19 #$#hjelp

16:19 [Newbie] Tiberius Black: Make sure to have your key in hand and enter ship.

16:19 [Newbie] Cara West: Enter ship name.

16:20 [Newbie] Brianna West: If you're worried about ship names that might match to yours, you could do something like enter my Home, since I have a ship with the name home in it and others do as well.

16:21 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovelyn: How do I hold my keyring.

16:21 [Newbie] Brianna West: You can wear it, actually.

16:21 [Newbie] Brianna West: And still be able to enter your ships.

16:22 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovelyn: It just says "You don't see that here." when I type enter [my ship]

16:23 [Newbie] Cara West: If it's not in the garage it'll be on the landing pad.

16:23 [Newbie] Calyssa Calaway: Keep in mind that enter should work just fine too.

16:24 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovelyn: Okay thanks it was on the landing pad. All set now.

16:31 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovelyn: Ugh sorry but I need some more basic OOC help. I got this 1 person cargo hauler. Looking in CARGO its empty. Now I understand a ship needs a cargo hold and a salvage line to do salvaging. I am guessing that didn't come with my ship... Where can I buy one of them? I checked a few shops I found such as the starship upgrade store and didn't anything like that for sale there.

16:32 [Newbie] Cara West: Uh that's automatic.

16:32 [Newbie] Cara West: All ships come with a cargo hold and at least 1 salvage line.

16:32 [Newbie] Esther Tarson: What happens if you run out of power when you are hauling.

16:33 #$#hjelp

16:33 [Newbie] Alessondria Lovelyn: Alright thanks Cara.

16:33 [Newbie] Esther Tarson: And there is no way to get a power booster out here. Do I just need to let it evakuate and go back and get the ship.

16:35 [Newbie] Cara West: That can be asked in char actually if you know how far out from where you are, someone may be nice enough to bring you a power booster or something. Though running out of power while hauling is unlikely unless you go to a different roid station than where you started. So say you left from 9, then haul to 9.
