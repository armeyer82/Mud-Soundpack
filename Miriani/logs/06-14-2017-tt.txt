Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple
cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, and a pair of washed light khaki
canvas sneakers here.
You can go east.

likely have seen energy pulses by now."
Aisling says to Ather, "We can go at some point together and dock it in Oracle."

light-years."

Ather Jammoa says, "If not more."
Morris Corlew says, "Well we went from somethin like 58 to 28 before it started
pushin us back. Think it took two teleports before the storm dissipated and we
were displaced 100 light-years further back."
Ather Jammoa says, "I think we went from 37 to 17."
Ather says to Morris, "Na, that all happened with a single jolt."
Ather Jammoa says, "Then we were like fuck this."

down."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a dark pink synthcotton shipsuit with a cluster of stars printed
on the chest. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes,
both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate
that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early
indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to
possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Is Ather still up by any chance?"
[PA] Morris Corlew: "This thing's greater than Sol equivalent."

launch tube, then deployed.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Three planets."
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Nice."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Yep. All gas giants though."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.
[PA] Rogue Romano: "Rest well Bob."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Rest well Mister Frenchname."
[PA] Luja Garland: "Sleep good, Pierre."
Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy

A massive sphere looms ahead of the hovertruck, soon becoming evident as a
slow-rolling ball of tentacles. The truck moves around it smoothly.

The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into the darkness.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is

before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by

[PA] Melinda Michaels: "But no image."
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "At any rate, Nicolette's name is in the library. So is
mine but I don't remember being down here."
[PA] Luja Garland: "Could the shipwrecks have jumped down here from where they
originally were?"

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A tiny, bright sphere floats in space here; a neutron star, the corpse of a
once-massive star. It is a perfect sphere, unlike most stars, and only a few
kilometers across. It is not very hot, and according to its sensor profile,
radiates mostly in ultraviolet and X-rays.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large

deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee appliqued with small gold
dragonflies, a pair of skinny white low rise jeans, and a pair of soft dark pink
slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant
white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather
sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple
coffee table, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', a silver projector, a small
fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, an ancient
moss-covered tree stump, an emerald green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron
orange zafu with a white strap, a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a magician's top hat, a shiny silver plastic
paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars,
a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow, a soft square brown
floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick
silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a medium aquarium containing
yellow and orange aquatic life and round rocks, and Manx the little calico
CatBot here.

Vernos Bailey says, "Eh my attempt at being funny, fails again."
Vernos says to Ather, "It would seem I need help being funny."
Morris Corlew says, "I guess I just don't get what's so funny bout it."
You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate
that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early
indications are that this is a classic system of mixed rocky and gas planets,
much like the systems where all of humanity's colonies can be found.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

but I'm not going to comment on it if someone does it. I've seen people who have
played this game for many years reference roundtime. So I certainly can't call
someone out on it.
You hear a loud clang, followed by a distinct thud: the sound of a ship docking.
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the
glass, then it withdraws.
[MTTS] atherj: It's more along the lines of referred to as a time of recovery of
sorts. Like, when you've set your weapons to fire, it takes a few seconds for
the computer to calculate, the weapons to get the necessary energy gathered etc.
Kind of same for battlesuit weapons and the like.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar
and cuffs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes,
both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

The blast chamber shuts down, having burned all of its fuel.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.
[PA] Sarah Bellamy: "Night Cheri."
You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't
recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.
Something tickles the back of your neck.
[PA] Vernos Bailey: "Anyone want to play horrible people?"
[PA] Eli Grey: "Get your footie pj's on and come play with us Rogue!"
[PA] Rogue Romano: "Sure, be there in a mo."
The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep
inside the starship.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Vernos Bailey: "Game will be played after repairs."
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Anybody else coming out?"
[PA] Vernos Bailey: "Me."
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "All in."
[PA] Eli Grey: "Repairs have been rushed!"
[PA] Eli Grey: "Er.. crushed."
[PA] Rogue Romano: "Woo, go go Nissi!"
