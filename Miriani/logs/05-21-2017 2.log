00:19:41 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.

00:46:19 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

01:29:19 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

02:12:29 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

03:05:39 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

03:46:34 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

04:35:17 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

05:19:06 (20 seconds roundtime.)

05:19:26 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a compact red refrigerator, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated pink cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small seashell pink trash

05:20:35 You say, "Yep."

05:20:40 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

05:20:40 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:20:50 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:20:50 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:20:51 The starship has left a unique area of space.

05:20:51 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:21:00 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

05:21:47 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:21:47 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:21:47 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

05:21:49 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:21:51 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

05:22:46 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

05:22:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

05:23:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly wi
18:11:24 th his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

18:16:59 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "See, that's proof right there. She's not admitting to it."

18:20:35 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So wait."

18:20:49 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Are you saying if I were to arrange for aisling to explode you'd pay 10 billion credits?"

18:20:56 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Just checking."

18:21:42 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I most certainly would not. You just assumed that I would pay 10 billion credits. It's not my job to correct your assumptions."

18:22:03 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If I agreed to it you would have had my agreement stated on record, which it was not!"

18:47:41 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Ather, I got an optical lens."

18:50:21 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]

18:50:21 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a compact red refrigerator, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated pink cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, a small oval turquoise ratta

19:01:36 Lily Kaise says, "I probably have enough ammo for 4 to 6 more so guess we'll go for as long as I can make the ammo work."

19:01:41 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

19:01:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:01:42 You say, "Ok, that works."

19:02:00 Lily Kaise says, "We should be able to get back with plenty of time before conquest ends."

19:02:06 You say, "Awesome."

19:02:18 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

19:02:23 A launch trajectory is located.

19:02:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:02:29 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

19:02:29 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 0.0.

19:02:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:02:36 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

19:02:36 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:02:37 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

19:02:42 Artifact Beacon Gamma 002 (Unclaimed) [Local Space] (Security: Delta-10)

19:02:42 Coordinate rundown:
Starships: Seventh Star (8) at (19, 18, 9)
Temporary Space Structures: (18, 6, 18), (19, 8, 19), (20, 19, 9)


19:02:46 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

19:02:46 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:02:46 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:02:56 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

19:03:26 Lily Kaise says, "Oh they were a little off when they put this beacon down."

19:03:35 You say, "Yeah, it looks like it."

19:03:35 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
With a sound like scraping stone, the ship changes direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 2.0.

19:03:40 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

19:03:40 A readout shows The Glyphmakers' Grave about 11.28 light-days toward Galactic Northeast and Very Slightly Up.
A temporary beacon appears to be 58.73 light-days away toward Galactic East.

19:03:45 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

19:04:10 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

19:04:15 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

19:04:15 With a sound like scraping stone, the ship changes direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 0.0, 0.0.
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

19:04:17 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

19:04:18 A readout shows The Glyphmakers' Grave about 39.14 light-days toward Galactic East.
A temporary beacon appears to be 90.89 light-days away toward Galactic East.

19:04:55 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

19:04:55 With a sound like scraping stone, the ship changes direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 0.0, -1.0.

19:05:14 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

19:05:14 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:05:15 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Oh my. Sorry Luja."

19:05:24 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I am fine."

19:05:28 Lily Kaise says, "A bit of a pain to navigate heh."

19:05:34 You nod.

19:05:51 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Glad to hear it! I think everyone sho,ld be fine."

19:05:58 Lily Kaise says, "Now I know why Ather and company were complaining that time when I put up the beacon out here."

19:06:05 Lily Kaise says, "Still it was doable."

19:06:09 You nod.

19:06:18 Lily Kaise resets the starship's mileage meter.

19:06:21 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

19:06:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:06:29 Lily Kaise takes a bite of a hot scrambled egg sandwich with a sizzling sausage patty and melted jalapeno cheddar on toasted focaccia bread.

19:06:32 You are carrying nothing.

19:34:54 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

20:17:46 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

21:05:52 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

22:01:00 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

22:52:03 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

23:15:42 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello, I would like to begin my report by welcoming the following new pilots to the corps. Baranth I'kabara, Fidel Besacabras, Kaiya Kiyone, Katie Celayla and Laura Luis, I hope you will have a lovely time with us and have some good experiences, learn a lot and enjoy a productive time as a civilian pilot. Then I now have the state of the corps report as of Friday May 19th 2317. For all the new pilots and cadets among us, this state of the corps report gives information on how often we have had a leading role and used AEU ships for Decoy Beacon drops, Rats Nests and Salvage ops during the current term. So, on may 19th, 1 month into the current term, the AEU had completed 18 out of 188 total decoy beacon drops (9.57%). The AEU was responsible for 2 out of 16 total destroyed rats nests (12.50%). And finally, the AEU was responsible for 1 out of 25 total salvage ops (4.00%). This concludes the state of the corps report. Finally, we are about to enter the final week of the current liaison term, and nominations will soon begin for the positions of Industrial Whip, Space Defense Captain, Ground Squad Leader and Voice of the Corps. If anyone has any questions about this process or any of these 4 positions, feel free to ask me or one of the other pilots, and we will be glad to explain. With this, I wish you a nice day, and fly safe. Kim Saunders. [21:03 21 May 2317 GST]

23:37:32 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
