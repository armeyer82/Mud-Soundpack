01:33 Brianna West
She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This slender woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 8 inches tall with an ample bust size. Her heart-shaped face bears a light golden tan complexion. Her silky waist-length, honey blonde hair is styled in silky ringlets accented by tongues of holographic golden flame. She has expressive celestial blue eyes with an elegant button nose above a set of full, pouty lips which part to reveal sparkling white, perfectly straight teeth. Her abdomen is very large and rounded, appearing to have shifted lower on her frame. She has a sapphire blue drawing of a winged heart on her forehead and a hot pink drawing of a pair of angel wings with the words "simply angelic" written above them on her ears. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a bright energy field.
She has a tattoo of a female angel with her white feathered wings spread out in flight on her right shoulder, a tattoo of a male angel with his midnight black feathered wings spread in an arc on her left shoulder, a tattoo of a red heart on her left thigh, a tattoo of a pink heart with a blood-tipped arrow going through it on her right thigh, a tattoo of an angel with rays of light emanating from it on her upper back, a tattoo of a gold phoenix being born out of flames on her lower back, and a tattoo of a sapphire blue spaceship on her torso.
She has a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her left earlobe and a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with sparkly snow white eyeshadow. She is wearing sparkly snow white lip dye on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted misty silver with vibrant orange plumes of flame and adorned with obsidian flecks and the nails on her right hand are painted misty silver with vibrant orange plumes of flame and adorned with obsidian flecks.
For a top, she is wearing a long purple silk cape with silver fastenings over a draping purple and silver cashmere halter top which projects an image of smoke rising from it and a shimmering purple and gold silk pushup bra with beaded tassels. For a bottom, she is wearing a long clingy purple and silver silk pencil skirt with holographic smoke drifting from the hem over a psychedelic purple skimpy G-string with onyx rose charms adorning the waistband. She is wearing a pair of sexy smoky black patent leather heels with a spiral of silver flame across the toes on her feet. She is wearing an eye-catching sapphire blue rose gold belly chain adorned with tiny dangling white glass lilies around her waist. She is also wearing a high-capacity sparkly Lore computer, a spacious cerulean blue rabbit fur diaper bag with a dangling silver angel charm on the zipper, a small well-crafted harp hanging from a golden chain, a moonstone studde
01:33 d gold digital wristwatch with an angel-shaped liquid crystal face, a sky blue reinforced alligator skin leather tote bag with a heraldic cross design stamped on the front and a clasp shaped like a crown, a yellow beaded velvet garment bag with priceless gems lining the openings, an antique white gold engagement ring set with a radiant bloodstone, an intricately braided white gold chain with an elegant baby-shaped platinum locket encrusted with sapphires suspended from it, a gold suede purse with beaded black roses on it, a dainty tri-colored gold friendship ring featuring a princess-cut red 4 karat star ruby accented by white diamonds, a gold padded fleece cradle sling, a delicate white gold diamond-studded wedding ring, and a blue velvet artifact storage container.
She is carrying nothing.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret tucked into a corner, an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats resting against the back wall, an antique white animal fur futon with a rustic animal print blanket draped across the back resting against the left wall, an antique white mahogany tea table surrounded by elegant golden thrones in the center of the room, a gold trash bin tucked into a corner, a furry white Bear skin area rug in front of a massive marble fireplace with a mahogany hearth and a mosaic tile mantel, a tall white marble entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen nex to an antique white mahogany tea table surrounded by elegant golden thrones, a massive marble fireplace with a mahogany hearth and a mosaic tile mantel looming at the front of the room, a mahogany coffee table in the corner between an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats and an antique white animal fur futon with a rustic animal print blanket draped across the back with a delicate crystal vase holding lilies mixed with orchids and daffodils tied at the stems with white satin ribbon sitting on top of it, three glossy blue security drones, a shiny gold starship simulator, a low blue marble garden fountain with water streaming from the hands of an angel kneeling in its basin bubbling quietly
03:52  against the right wall, a gold comfortable padded baby bouncer seat with an overhead toy bar that has several stuffed superheroes hanging down, a small mahogany bassinet lined with amethyst purple soft padding and covered with a midnight blue canopy, a gleaming blue medical drone, a red plastic wagon, an enormous cream lion skin area rug, a stack of pine firewood logs, a yellow metal wagon, a sleek sapphire blue metal horse carriage with pale pink wheels, a compact warm gold baby carriage which plays music as it moves, a hologram of a flickering campfire projected in the middle of the room, a roomy light blue dog house, a glossy fire agate sphere, a sparkly gold vanity table with a lighted angel-shaped mirror, a portable jet black vanity table with an attached plush sapphire blue chair and a lighted dolphin-shaped mirror, a sky blue portable salon, a beautiful blonde-haired nanny, a handsome waiter wearing a white tuxedo, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, Calina West, Melody West, Leah West, a compact camouflaged cooler with zip up compartments along the sides, Kara West, Harmony West, a hologram of a beach sunset projected on one wall, Lucy Kasey, Julie Casey, a jet black box with a glowing snowflake on top, a deck of Assault cards trimmed in gold, Shayla the droid, and a white Amalthean wolfhound here.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa, a pale cream granite coffee table, a comfortable dark blue recliner with a sleek electronic device balanced on one arm, a wide black air hockey table, an indoor gold fountain with a stream of water flowing from an angel's halo, three glossy pink security drones, and an Amalthean wolf cub here.

13:23 ["Passionate Blaze" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa, a pale cream granite coffee table, a comfortable dark blue recliner with a sleek electronic device balanced on one arm, a wide black air hockey table, an indoor gold fountain with a stream of water flowing from an angel's halo, and three glossy pink security drones here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and down.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret tucked into a corner, an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats resting against the back wall, an antique white animal fur futon with a rustic animal print blanket draped across the back resting against the left wall, an antique white mahogany tea table surrounded by elegant golden thrones in the center of the room, a gold trash bin tucked into a corner, a furry white Bear skin area rug in front of a massive marble fireplace with a mahogany hearth and a mosaic tile mantel, a tall white marble entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen nex to an antique white mahogany tea table surrounded by elegant golden thrones, a massive marble fireplace with a mahogany hearth and a mosaic tile mantel looming at the front of the room, a mahogany coffee table in the corner between an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats and an antique white animal fur futon with a rustic animal print blanket draped across the back with a delicate crystal vase holding lilies mixed with orchids and daffodils tied at the stems with white satin ribbon sitting on top of it, three glossy blue security drones, a shiny gold starship simulator, a low blue marble garden fountain with water streaming from the hands of an angel kneeling in its basin bubbling quietly a

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

It is currently Alexander West's turn.

22:20 Kitty Mars
She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This thin woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a tight floral linen sleeveless blouse decorated with coral sequins over a deep blue lace pushup bra dotted with red roses. For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of snug blue jeans with elaborate diamond patterns on the back pockets over deep blue satin and lace boy shorts. She is wearing a pair of sexy clear wedge sandals with open-toes and with little purple jewels on the straps on her feet. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a violet spacesuit jet, a pink flight control scanner, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded 
22:20 with amethysst, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a long necklace made of smoothly polished light purple amethyst stones, a handmade ring made of amethyst and multi-colored stones, a cute tortie cat backpack, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a pink armor storage bag, a pink stun armor storage bag, a high-capacity pink Lore computer, a deep purple leather briefcase, a violet rolled toolkit, a purple diving gear bag, a small handheld radio receiver, a sleek hot pink repair kit, an asteroid hauling kit, a multi-strand of iridescent strawberry pearls, a seashell pink friendship bracelet with kitten-shaped beads, a silver ring with an amethyst gemstone, an amethyst crystal butterfly, a diamond Commoveo membership ring, and a pink fluffy artifact storage container.
She is carrying nothing.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.
