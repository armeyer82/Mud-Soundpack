00:04 You make a selection on a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

00:04 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kitty" reports current location pinpointed at Pinnacle.

00:04 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:04 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
> (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

00:04 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

00:04 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

00:04 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:04 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:04 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:04 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:04 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

00:04 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:04 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:04 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:04 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:04 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:04 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

00:04 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:04 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 7, 6."

00:04 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:05 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:05 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:05 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:05 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

00:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

00:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:05 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:05 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a violet spacesuit jet, a pink flight control scanner, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a cute tortie cat

10:03 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

10:03 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

10:03 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

10:03 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

10:03 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

10:04 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

10:04 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

10:04 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

10:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

10:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

10:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

10:04 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

10:04 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

10:04 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

23:59 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.
