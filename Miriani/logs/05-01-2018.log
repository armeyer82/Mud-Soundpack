["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.
03:32  You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and Mekensie the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

Application Response Coding
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
When in-game applications are reviewed, they will be coded with a response and sent back to the applicant to make them aware of the result. Sometimes the result may come in the form of an acceptance letter but other times you may receive a rejection letter with a specific reason code. Those codes are listed below:
  Response Codes
 A: Unprofessional. The application may have been sloppy, unreadable, or contain too many spelling and grammar mistakes.
 B: Questionable Service Record. Your past offenses have overshadowed your merits. You may have lost starship rights in the past, lost communication rights, violated treaties, jumped alliances multiple times, committed wartime crimes, shown a disrespect for authority or rules, or any combination of the above.
 C: Plagiarism. You copied your application or a portion of it from another pilot's application.
 D: Suspected Falsification. Your answers to one or more questions were suspect and/or deliberately falsified.
 E: Revoked. Your application was later found to be inaccurate and or falsified and has been revoked.
 In addition, you may receive a response coded with a number. If this is the case, the coded number will correspond to a question number on your application. This means your response to that question was either blatantly incorrect or not representative of the responses
22:38  expected.

Sabotage
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
The recent trend in self-industrialization afforded by asteroid mining has given rise to a number of new devices. Among these are several devices that can be used to interfere with, or suppress, the standard functions of a starship's operations. These aptly named 'sabotage devices' are portable and easy to hide in a ship's systems, making them ideal for covert operations that require a target starship to become incapacitated for a short period of time.
  Usage
First, make sure you have at least 3000 license points. It will require that many to actually use the device, but it may require more if you intend to build it yourself. But for our purposes we're merely using it, so make sure you have 3000 or more. Then...
1.) Pick a room to install the device in. Some devices may require that they be installed in a certain type of room. These should be fairly obvious (weapon sabotage likely goes in a weapon room) and will be left as an exercise to the reader.
2.) Access the room's maintenance panel with the PANEL command.
3.) Install the device with the INSTALL command.
4.) Make a visit to the starship's control room or engineering room and write down the ship's current maintenance code with the MAINTENANCE command.
5.) Initialize your device with the INITIALIZE command. This will require the maintenance code that you wrote down earlier.
6.) Activat
22:44 e the device with the ACTIVATE command or a remote activation device. (Note that a remote activation device will require 12,500 points to use.)
  Remote Activation
Certain devices can be left dormant until you choose to activate them from afar. A remote activation device will allow you to activate your sabotage devices from within the same sector. You simply USE the activation device and select the sabotage device that you wish to activate.
  Maintenance Code Gotchas
Starship maintenance codes are security measures employed to ensure that only authorized users can perform maintenance on any given ship. As such, the maintenance code will change each time it's used, or each time the starship is powered up. You will likely not be able to obtain a maintenance code for a ship and store it for later use, as the code can change often and invalidate any previous codes. As such, each device you install in a ship will require a different maintenance code from the others.
  Removal
Removing the devices is as simple as opening the PANEL and using the UNINSTALL command. The device's internal electronics will be destroyed, rendering it useless.

Sabotage Devices
--------------------------------------------------
Relativity Damper: Reduces the amount of microwave radiation inside the resonance cavity, decreasing the radiation pressure and slowing down the drive.
Cannon Ignition Inhibitor: Disables the electrical charge that gets applied to bardenium upon launch. The cannons will still fire, but the bardenium will remain uncharged, vastly reducing its damage potential.
Energy Deefficiencifier: Wastes energy into heat. Affected ships will find their charge drains faster.
Sensor Bandwidth Inhibitor: Sensors (scan, focus, starmap, etc) will take longer to retrieve data.
Exotic Matter Contaminator: Taps into the exotic matter lines and introduces contaminates. This causes wormhole jumps to fail 50% of the time. It can only be used 3 times before the supply of contaminates runs out and the device is rendered inert.
External Communication Jammer: Silences the external communication system.
Internal Communication Jammer: Silences the PA system.
Internal Communication Monitor: Transmits PA messages to a source up to 1 LY away. This device REQUIRES the use of a remote activator, which is where transmissions will be relayed through.
Autopilot Scrambler: Has a 50% chance of causing autopilot to behave as if the ship was in a sector with sensor interference.
Manual Navigation Scrambler: Has a 50% chance to cause the ship to fly in a random direction instead of the inte
22:45 nded direction.

Application Response Coding
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
When in-game applications are reviewed, they will be coded with a response and sent back to the applicant to make them aware of the result. Sometimes the result may come in the form of an acceptance letter but other times you may receive a rejection letter with a specific reason code. Those codes are listed below:
  Response Codes
 A: Unprofessional. The application may have been sloppy, unreadable, or contain too many spelling and grammar mistakes.
 B: Questionable Service Record. Your past offenses have overshadowed your merits. You may have lost starship rights in the past, lost communication rights, violated treaties, jumped alliances multiple times, committed wartime crimes, shown a disrespect for authority or rules, or any combination of the above.
 C: Plagiarism. You copied your application or a portion of it from another pilot's application.
 D: Suspected Falsification. Your answers to one or more questions were suspect and/or deliberately falsified.
 E: Revoked. Your application was later found to be inaccurate and or falsified and has been revoked.
 In addition, you may receive a response coded with a number. If this is the case, the coded number will correspond to a question number on your application. This means your response to that question was either blatantly incorrect or not representative of the responses
22:48  expected.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.
