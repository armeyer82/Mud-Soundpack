received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person cipactli "Cruelty". The organization has earned 150,355.77 credits.
[MTTS] Squidmind: They'll also be the minimum size, but I can upgrade existing
stations if it's going to cause problems.
[MTTS] usfolks: I don't think so now that I think of it. I think all the station
builders have rift drives on their mod transports.
[MTTS] alc_71: Asteroid haulers are scouts. So, I wouldn't think that it would
cause an issue there.
[MTTS] ionai: What about stations people take carriers into?
[MTTS] usfolks: And those that take bigger ships to the Bubble will be fine, as
the bigger ships like galleons will already have rift drives. So I don't see an
issue. Was mostly just curious.
[MTTS] wulf: Fine amneties.
[MTTS] usfolks: Well, carriers would be the exception I suppose.
[MTTS] alc_71: Most carriers have rift drives as well.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Carriers would need the next size up.
[MTTS] wulf: The lounge top has the best menu description.
[MTTS] usfolks: The only one I can see having an issue is 776 and 777 as I think
some of the early pilots that are using that are taking carriers.

[MTTS] wulf: A super big ship that can only do long-range travel through
inserter stations would certainly be interesting.
[MTTS] usfolks: I thought that too.

Subject: Salvage op trip in the works
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 15:04 24 April 2317 GST

More details will be posted as we draw closer to the date for this trip to
begin. However, the plan is to head out around 80 light-years and do a bunch of
ops. We will also have a roid station for those who like hauling as there will
be some down time between ops. Of course there will be a salvage station for
those of you who enjoy that particular activity. Keep in mind, I believe grade
70 or 60 is the lowest this field will have.
We will be passing out more detailed instruction letters so that everybody will
have an instruction sheet with them once they leave comm's.
We are extending the invitation to anyone who wishes to take part in this
industrial trip. We are hoping to have this kick off on May 5th barring any
obsticals.
One note for newer pilots, we will do our best to see that you too can take part
in the activities of this trip. However, do not take your ships out there via
the station network we will have in place. You will get stuck without comm's
override. So, any newer pilots out there who would like to participate in some
way, drop a reply here or a letter in the mail. We'll see what we have got and
can make some arrangements.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small

around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an elegant
white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both
biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, both ankles, and
both feet are left uncovered.

day when I'm not at work but for a certain time during that day which might not
occur when the chain is due to be renewed. So I wanted to discuss it with you

Subject: combat crew will be needed for station set up with this op trip
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 01:50 26 April 2317 GST

I will need a combat crew to follow along the beacon network building ship as we
are using capital beacons. This crew will need to be available at around 1600 to
1800 GST. I could also go with the combat ship provided I have enough to go on
the initial beacon chain setup crew.
Also, we'll need a second ship to carry the needed stations such as salvage op
and processor. If we cannot get this part, the initial mod transport will need
to make a second trip out before we begin.
The combat crew will need to be one that can possibly be available for ten
hours, depending on riftflow.

Greetings Melinda,
I discussed the Org rotation idea with Shule for the Grade 80 Debris Field. My
concern was that during the week, I am only available for a few hours during the
early morning from about midnight until around 0300. Then on Weekends, I am
generally available some of the time. Shule won't be working much, if at all,
during the first week in June. So we wouldn't want our rotation to occur during
that particular week. Otherwise, I feel confident that I have Shule's commitment
to back me up if our rotation turn occurs on a weekday or that the beacon chain
needs replacement when I am not able to work.
So, ccount on SEAS to commit to a rotation slot to help to maintain the Grade 80
Beacon Chain.
With kind regards,
Lily Kaise

Capital sector beacons draw a response similar to a high decoy beacon. While the
stations will be using stealth equipment to help reduce the response, no one
seems to know how much that will actually help.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a pair of blue
corduroy jeans, a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars,
a bag of felo treats, a tight black t-shirt with a bright purple dragon
embroidered on the front, a pair of skinny faded blue low rise jeans, and a pair
of mystic purple suede clogs here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
