["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent star
07:34 ship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt, Paws the droid, a black cat, a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes, a fluffy blue cat, Kissy the droid, Kitcat the droid, a transparent trash can, a large soft purple pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an orange tabby kitten, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a bright turquoise cooler, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a purple velvet artifact storage container, a transparent architectural design simulator, a printout of the service record for "Mischief", a pair of white platform sandals, a pair of multi colored clogs, and a pink handheld planetary surveyor here.

07:34 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (hostile environment)
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a white wicker wardrobe, a fuzzy suitcase, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a pink suitcase, and a pair of gray sneakers with red laces here.
You see Kitty Mars (dozing) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) here.
You can go south.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer.

20:53 [Newbie] Jake Hampten: Weerd question I know but I saw about this weapon on the ship combat.

20:53 [Newbie] Cody Williams: Hence the term autolocking.

20:53 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: It does, however, need a pretty significant cooldown.

20:54 [Newbie] Stanton Sefdon: I could be wrong but I think they also only have a certain range so you could evade it by moving out of range.

20:54 [Newbie] Lena Mylan: I think it's 4 or 6 units, but unless I am mistaken, it works like pulses. In which, if your in range when you are targetted, you can't evade it by moving out of range.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blu

You can go south, down, and out.

21:23 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

21:23 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

21:23 You begin the launch sequence.

21:23 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:23 You lean in toward Kitty Mars and gently kiss her lips.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-too
