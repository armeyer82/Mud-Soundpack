A trail of shiny gold tiles create a pathway through plush cream carpet from the rotating glass doors at the entrance to a large marble reception desk poised along the back wall of the lobby. In the center of the room is a white stone fountain, the polished tiles surrounding the fountain in a soft cloud of pale gold. Wall-mounted flower pots hold an array of lush flowers, their delicate petals spilling over the edge of the containers to trail lazily down the wine red wallpaper. An enormous painting of the apartment grounds hangs above the reception desk, and a bank of gold-trimmed elevators in the corner sends out a melodious chime each time the cart arrives on the lobby level.

02:04 ["Nightingale" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see an internal stun turret, an intricately detailed figurine of a sentinel, a long red sofa with velvety soft cushions, a hexagonal-shaped silver glass coffee table, a comfortable blue couch with a blanket thrown over the back, an extra-large bright blue children's rug, a cozy white love seat with a heart-shaped back, a flappy duck on wheels, Caly the droid, Mikey the droid, a fuzzy blue security drone, and a fuzzy blue medical drone here.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.

15:13 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 25490; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

15:18 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see the one-person junker "Acrylon Courier Transport 7862" and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" powered down here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna" landed here.

16:26 [Private | Anny Rain] Anny Rain transmits, "Because explore space need long charge and long range jump drive to back."

16:27 [Private | Anny Rain] You transmit, "Yeah, we have a long-range jump drive."

16:27 [Private | Anny Rain] Anny Rain transmits, "commonwealth can jump to a planet?"

16:27 [Private | Anny Rain] You transmit, "Yep"

16:27 [Private | Anny Rain] Anny Rain transmits, "i saw someone use it"

16:28 You begin the launch sequence.

16:28 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

16:28 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

16:28 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:28 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:28 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:28 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:28 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

16:28 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:28 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Acrylon.

16:28 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

16:28 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:28 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

16:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

16:29 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

16:29 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

20:03 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

20:03 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

20:03 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

20:03 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:03 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

20:03 The ship is already moving.

20:03 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:03 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

20:03 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

20:03 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

20:03 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

20:03 The ship must be in space to do that.

20:03 The ship must be in space to do that.

20:03 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
[Short-range Communication] Joseph Navarro transmits, "It's worth 110 mill, friend. With your atmo salvagers and your salvage lines, transfer couplings, etc etc. I think 75 mill is reasonable considering the price."

20:03 You stand up.

20:04 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

20:04 [Short-range Communication] Primus ElCielo transmits, "Listen to him, he's the reasonable one out of the two of us."

20:04 [Short-range Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "I wanna buy."

20:04 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

20:04 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:04 [Short-range Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "What am I buying again."

20:04 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:04 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:04 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

20:04 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:04 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

20:04 [Short-range Communication] Primus ElCielo transmits, "My heart."

20:04 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

20:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

20:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

20:04 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

20:04 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

20:04 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret and a dark blue suede crewman chair here.
You see Primus ElCielo (sitting on a dark blue suede crewman chair) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

21:18 (Alliance High Guard Command; Garage) A bright ring of light emerges from the floor and comes to a halt. Michael Calaway steps off.

21:18 (Alliance High Guard Command; Garage) Caly the droid, Mikey the droid, a fuzzy blue security drone, a fuzzy blue medical drone, and a flappy duck on wheels arrive behind Michael Calaway.

21:18 (Alliance High Guard Command; Garage) Michael Calaway waddles northeast.

21:18 (Alliance High Guard Command; Garage) Caly the droid, Mikey the droid, a fuzzy blue security drone, a fuzzy blue medical drone, and a flappy duck on wheels leave the area behind Michael Calaway.

21:18 Michael Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "no eng for you!"

21:18 Primus ElCielo's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "already here bro"

21:18 Primus ElCielo moans over the intercom.

21:18 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:18 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Nibbles" has launched from Rolukssica.

21:18 You peer southwest and see...

21:18 ["Nibbles" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a dark blue suede crewman chair here.
You see Primus ElCielo (sitting on a dark blue suede crewman chair) and Carrie Reid (sitting on Primus ElCielo) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

21:18 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:18 Primus ElCielo's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I'll double"

21:18 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

21:19 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

21:19 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

21:19 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

21:19 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

21:19 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Nibbles" has initiated an intrasector slip.

21:19 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

21:19 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Nibbles" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

21:19 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:19 You peer southwest and see...

21:19 ["Nibbles" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The room is bathed in dull blue light emanating from the wormhole outside. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is traveling through a jumpgate.
You see an internal stun turret and a dark blue suede crewman chair here.
You see Primus ElCielo (sitting on a dark blue suede crewman chair) and Carrie Reid (sitting on Primus ElCielo) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

21:19 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:19 Primus ElCielo sashays in from the southwest.

21:19 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:19 Primus ElCielo sashays southwest.

21:19 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:19 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:19 You peer southwest and see...

21:19 ["Nibbles" Engineering Room]

Even with environmental control technology put into place to make pluto inhabitable, the temperature here is bitterly cold. Thick fog, presumably created by the planet's gasses, swirls around, making navigation on this swaying, creaking bridge even more treacherous.

You can go south and out.

22:04 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

22:04 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:04 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

22:04 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of gray jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a black stun armor storage bag, and a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

22:04 You are carrying nothing.

22:04 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

22:05 A high-capacity transparent Lore computer

22:05 This small and surprisingly hefty handheld computer device sports a compact brightly-lit touch-screen display and an on-demand virtual input keypad. The stylistic open book logo of LoreTech Industries, Inc. edifies the metallic backing of the device.  A Loretech biometric expansion card, a Loretech printer expansion, an image data extraction card, a Loretech TransLink expansion card, a Loretech OCR expansion card, a Loretech speech synthesis expansion card, and a Loretech holographic imaging card occupy seven expansion slots on the device.  It has three hardware expansion slots remaining.

22:05 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

22:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:05 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship and four planets have been detected in the sector."

22:05 Select a ship:

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:05 >> Command Aborted <<

22:06 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:06 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:06 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:06 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

22:06 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your chair.

22:06 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:06 The ship must be in space to do that.

22:06 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

22:06 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:06 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

22:06 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:06 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:06 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:06 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:06 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

Lore Computer
--------------------------------------------------
Lore computers are small devices that can be extraordinarily helpful. They feature a memo program for writing, reading, and transferring text files, optical character recognition for scanning signs into your computer, a scratch pad for quick notes, a unit converter, a calculator, a tracking system, a shopping guide, a news uplink, and a variety of other functions. Operating a Lore computer is extremely simple, and there are a number of options available. It's best to just use the computer and try the various functions for yourself. However, to get you started, here are some explanations of the available hardware and software.

  Hardware
Lore computers come with several hardware slots as well as hardware expansion cards. To load a card, you simply type LOAD [card name]. To remove a card, you merely UNLOAD [Lore Computer Name].

Translink - A TransLink expansion card will enable you to perform two additional functions with your Lore computer.  First, it will enable you to enter the Lore ID of other Lore computers you'd like to let track the location of your Lore computer.  Second, it will allow you to track Lore computers of people who have authorized you to do so.  Please note this will only track the Lore computer and not it's owner so if the two should ever become separated, your results may not be what you expect. Furthermore, Loretech Industries bare
22:08 s no responsibility for anything that goes wrong as a result of tracking people.

Character Recognition -  A Character Recognition expansion card will enable your Lore computer to scan a document and then allow you to import it as a file onto your lore computer. You will have the opportunity to give the file a name after the scan is completed.

Printer - A Printer expansion card will enable your Lore computer to make printed hard copies of documents saved in it's memory.  Due to the wonders of Loretech technology, the printer is rated for over 1 trillion prints before needing replacement.

Biometric Scanner - A Biometric Scanner expansion card will provide additional security for your Lore computer.  It will allow you to take biometric readings of anyone in the same location as you to provide them access to your lore computer should they become in possession of it.  Anyone that is not in the biometric scanners database will be denied access to your system. If, for some reason, the biometric card should be removed without first clearing the stored identities, your Lore computer will be locked down until a biometric card is inserted again.

Speech Synthesis - A Speech Synthesis expansion card will enable you to command your Lore computer to output, in a synthesized voice, anything you write on the Lore computer's scratchpad.  This output will be visible to anyone in the same location as you.

Holographic Imager - Thi
22:08 s card allows you to take detailed images of a room, an object, or a group of objects. When prompted for a target, type group to choose who to include in an image. Once an image has been taken, you can access it from your Lore's holographic image album. After loading blank discs, you can also copy the data to a disc that will function similarly to a standard photograph, with one important exception: You can look at the individual objects in every picture. Simply LOOK <object name> IN <picture name> to look at anything that was present at the time the picture was taken.

Image Data Extractor - An image extractor allows a Lore computer to download the data from an image disc and import it into their photo album.

  Software
The Lore computer also comes with several useful software programs which enable you to perform a variety of functions.

File Management (Memopad) - The file management function allows you to create and store text documents. The interface is fairly straightforward, allowing you to add files and folders as well as edit, delete, or transfer them from one person to another. Anything you scan with the OCR card will end up in the file management.

Sundial - The sundial simply displays the current date and time.

Scratch Pad - The scratch pad is a place to quickly jot down notes. Once you finish writing a note, you can show it to somebody else in the room, print it to a file, or, if available, output the text to your speech synthesizer card to have it read to everybody in the room.

Calculator - The calculator allows you to quickly and easily enter equations into your Lore computer and receive the result. If you wish to perform multiple related calculations, you may use the # character to substitute with the value from your last equation. 

Examples: 
(5+5) * 8
The result of your equation, 80.0, briefly appears on the display.
5 + 5 * 8
The result of your equation, 45.0, briefly appears on the display.
35 + #
The result of your equation, 80.0, briefly appears on the display.

Unit Converter
The unit converter allows you to convert a number from one type to another. For detailed instructions on using the unit converter, select the option on your Lore menu and type HELP.

Tracking 
If you have a Translink card, your Lore computer is capable both of tracking and being tracked. Be aware, however, that you will be unable to track Lore computers that are travelling through wormholes or out of communications range.

Shopping Guide
The shopping guide is perhaps the most used function of the Lore computer. It automatically pulls data from stores in realtime to find the items you want. It can list every store category at once, list only upgrades, or it can search by string. There are a few limitations, especially with repeating items, but for the most part the shopping guide is an extremely valuable resource.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

23:03 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

23:04 ^Doraleigh Soto (C) (Female) is asleep!

23:04 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:04 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

23:04 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:04 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

23:04 The ship is already moving.

23:04 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:04 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:04 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:04 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

23:04 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your chair.

23:04 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:04 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

23:04 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:04 There are no ships here.

23:04 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:04 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:04 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

23:04 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

23:04 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

23:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

23:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

23:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

23:05 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

23:05 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

23:05 You must stand up first.

23:05 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the eight-person gunship "Kingdom Harts", the one-person fighter "Sands of Time", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion" landed here.

23:35 ["Sting Ray" Control Room]
This small control room provides just enough space to accommodate a person or two. A small control array is placed around the room, allowing anybody within reach to access the starship's system. The starmap viewer, while smaller than regular starships, still provides the same invaluable information. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You can go down and out.

23:58 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: If you have a planetary scan that matches their requirements, you can give it to them.
