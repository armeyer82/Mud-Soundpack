Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Joy Ride"; Control Room]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large leather couch, a small purple trash can, a sleek stainless steel
beverage machine with purple accents, and an insulated purple cooler here.
Blake Madison is dozing on a large leather couch. Rogue Romano, Lily Kaise,
Lillian Hudson, and Melinda Michaels are sitting on a large leather couch.
You can go south and out.

along for the ride."

yours."

Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "How y'all doing over
there?"
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South and Very Slightly Down:
"We're good. Just chillin, sitting... You know?"
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Oh."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South and Very Slightly Down:
"Everyone got their clothes on over there?"
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "No."
You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls,
followed by some scraping sounds.
Melinda says, "Bari."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South and Very Slightly Down:
"Damn. Enjoy that double for me then."
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Haha."

Lillian sighs.

Melinda grins at Lillian.
Rogue gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
"Yeah," asks Rogue, "isn't that how it is mostly for everyone?"
"Well," says Lillian, "I don't know about you, but I want more than credits and
sex."
"Work hard all day," says Rogue, "then go find a good fucking later."
Lillian Hudson takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers
Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.
"Women, well the list is bigger," Melinda says. "There is credits, moobs, um, or
boobs, and then do they have a lot of furriness or not a lot. See, women are
more pickie."
Lillian laughs at Melinda.
Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cool pint of Marzore Dark.

included."
Melinda laughs.
Lillian says, "Oh good."

"Darn," says Melinda, "I forgot to put a note in the other ship."
"I'm glad you didn't." Lillian laughs. "I wouldn't find it until we were home."
Melinda says, "I figured somebody would find and read it over the hypercaster."
Lillian says, "You could have put it in the sightseer."
Melinda says, "A missed opportunity."
"Or you couldn't have because I had it up until the last minute," Lillian says.
"Maybe I did it on purpose."
Lillian grins.
Melinda says, "Probably."
Melinda says, "I told them all you'd be last."
"Of course," says Lillian in an Old Earth accent. "I was trying to get more
artifacts because I only got seven."
"Yeah but, you are often last," Melinda says.
Lillian says, "True."
Melinda says, "You'd be late for your own wedding."
Melinda Michaels kisses Lillian Hudson on the nose.
Lillian exclaims, "Nonsense!"
Melinda says, "I'd bet on it."
Melinda giggles.
Lillian gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.
"Well," says Lillian, "in order to see if you'd win that bet is if I were to
have a wedding."
Rogue Romano finishes off a shot of chilled vodka.
Lillian Hudson says, OOCly, "Oy. This is what happens when someone else is

time."
Melinda laughs.
Lillian laughs.
Lillian says, "Okay, I could see that."
Melinda smiles.
"But the point stands," says Lillian. "We can't see who's right without a
wedding. So who knows?"
"Okay," says Melinda, "this is how it will work."

Star Conquest Help: Alliance Governments
--
Category: Background
--
The alliances may consist of only humans, but their systems of government differ
considerably.
THE LEAGUE OF OLD EARTH DEMOCRACIES
In many ways, the League government is a progression of the United States
Government of today.
At its head, the League possesses a President, voted for by the general
population in elections once every five years.  Term limits do not apply, (as
opposed to today in the USA) so a president could theoretically continue to run
indefinitely.  The President is the Presidential Candidate that gains the
majority of the votes in the election.
There is also the League Congress, split into the House of Representatives, a
collection of senators elected from each world of the League the number of each
depending on the population of the planet or moon, and the Senate; where two
senators represent each world.
The 300 senators from the House of Representatives are currently split in the
following fashion:
* Old Earth: 100 senators.
* Mars: 62 senators.
* Luna: 50 senators.
* Centauri: 43 senators. 
* Vesta: 30 senators.
* Callisto: 15 senators.
While in theory this is a democratic system, where the President must pass
everything before the two houses of Congress, bribery and corruption are common.
 Whips are employed regularly, with spin being one of the major efforts when
attempting to pass new legislation and get things done, rather than fact or
voter wishes.
The current President of the League is Johan Dietrich of the Conservatives
Party.  He has been President since 2314, when then-President Charisse Robinson
stepped down. Robinson had been President since 2285, having previously won four
elections and postponed a fifth due to the Outsider subjugation of humanity. 
Robinson is now working with the Accord of Free Worlds.
The population of League space is approximately 60 billion.
The capital world is Old Earth, housing the seat of League government in the
city of Brussels.
--
THE ALLIANCE OF EXTRASOLAR UNIONS
While similar to the League, the AEU governing body is slightly different.
The top-most level of control still resides with the President, and elections
also take place once every five years.  But the general population vote for the
party and individual representatives, with the President as the leader of the
winning party, having been elected as a minister in his or her own region.
The President is still the figurehead of the government, but more power resides
within the Cabinet, the council of ministers appointed to various roles within
government that collectively decide policy and direction.
There are also two Houses, split between elected ministers from New Earth in one
house, respected authorities from Hyperion, Telex, Bikura, Endymion and Aenea in
the other.  These houses have veto powers over legislation, with the latter also
having the ability to call for a vote of no confidence, forcing an election when
general faith in the current party has been lost.
Each world is split into several regions based on continents, voting in their
own representative minister to give them a voice.  Each planet appoints one of
their ministers to represent them in the alliance Cabinet.  These are usually,
but not always, the chosen Chancellor or primary minister of each world.
The Cabinet: 6 ministers.
* New Earth: 25 regions.
* Hyperion: 20 regions.
* Telex: 16 regions.
* Bikura: 13 regions.
* Endymion: 10 regions.
* Aenea: 8 regions.
While there is still corruption within some levels of the AEU government, checks
are in place to attempt to excise it.
The current President of the AEU is Warren Garner of the Green Earth Party, who
took office in 2310 after then-President Christopher Sheffield of the New
Republic Party (along with the majority of government) was arrested by a joint
task force of EAOS and AEU security after attempts were made to surrender to the
Outsiders, culminating in Enforcer drones on New Earth and the threat of
destruction for other alliances.  The National Patriots Party (led by Aaron
Richmond) were the official Opposition Party, but during the Resistance offered
a Coalition with the Green Earth Party to ensure a unified government. 
Sheffield had been President since 2290, having won three elections and
postponing a fourth due to the Outsider subjugation of humanity.
The population of AEU space is approximately 45 billion.
The capital world is New Earth, with the seat of AEU government being housed in

THE CONFEDERATION OF FRINGE WORLDS
Once, the Fringe government was a parliamentary republic, with the President and
Prime Minister sharing power; the President being the head of state while the
Prime Minister being head of government.
The last individuals to hold these roles were President Robin Domon and Prime
Minister Courtney Brown.
However, in 2292 a brief but powerful coup forced them from power and their
current whereabouts are unknown.  
Today, the Fringe government is a Military Dictatorship headed by one Space
Chief Marshal Nina Thomas.
No reason has ever been given for the coup, but many believe that Space Marshal
Thomas (along with large portions of the military) considered the President and
Prime Minister to be corrupt and abusing their position, keeping many worlds of
the Fringe barely habitable while also cracking down on any attempt to gain
necessary food or equipment through less-than-legal means.
While evidence for this is less than easy to come by, it is clear that even with
a limited form of martial law in effect, under her current government the Fringe
has flourished in a way that as a republic it did not.
Indeed, today the average citizens of the Fringe worlds seem to adore their
Commander-in-Chief, as she takes a far more hands-on approach than President
Domon, PM Brown or the leaders of the other alliances ever have.
During the Outsider subjugation of humanity, it was Space Marshal Thomas who
kept the Fringe spirit burning with firey speeches, leading by example and even
losing an arm to an Outsider enforcer drone when she refused to surrender in
person without further 'negative stimulus' - her becoming unconscious from the
shock and pain being taken as her 'surrender'.
The population of Fringe space is approximately 25 billion.
The capital world is Chetumal, with the seat of Fringe government technically
residing on Nina Thomas's battle barge, a huge hovering war machine constructed
after the coup.  However, during the Outsider assault and subjugation, the
battle barge was heavily damaged and was forced to land several miles outside
Chetumal City, where Space Chief Marshal Thomas made her final stand and faced
down the army of Enforcer drones herself, leading the remaining vestiges of the
Fringe insurrection.

THE EGALITARIAN ALLIANCE OF SENTIENTS
Little is known about the inner workings of the EAOS' government body, but it is
clear that they have some kind of power sharing system, as James Korie and
Thomas Haldeman appeared to share control before the Outsider Subjugation of
Mankind.  Never explicitly refered to as President, Premier or any other term,
it is not known what exactly their respective roles are. 
Since 2309, James Korie has been held by the Confederation of Fringe Worlds for
'Crimes Against Humanity', as many in the alliances believe him responsible for
the original Subjugation.
The population of EAOS space is believed to be approximately 65 million.
The capital station is The Torus.  It is unknown where any members of the EAOS
government meet.

THE SOVEREIGN MUTUALITY OF DISPARATE FREEMEN
Less a true singular alliance and more a collective of independent
nation-states, the Mutuality appears to have a government-by-committee.  Each
space station, along with many of the larger starships, seem to be controlled by
what almost amounts to their own micro-nations - each sending an individual to
become part of the Mutuality government as a whole.  How each individal
collective decides on their chosen representative or their leadership in general
is unknown. 
This does mean, however, that intra-alliance conflict is likely to be common.
While there is no full listing of individuals that posess a leadership role
available at the current time, some names have become known:
Aleksei Frolov - apparently a military commander
Renee Sauveterre - controller of space station Helios
Cassandra of Turanova - controller of space station Tandem
Brandon Ryland - controller of space station DeMargas
There are most likely others, but this will likely remain unclear - at least for
the forseeable future. What is clear is that there is no unified whole.
There are also communitees of unregistered pilots that have no premanent
residence.  It is unclear whether all, some, or none of these are a part of the
Mutuality as a whole - though we do know that not all unregistered pilots have
joined with the Mutuality or become a protectorate.
The population of Mutuality space is unknown, as borders fluctuate rapidly and
there is no official census.
The capital station is probably Helios, but this may be subject to change.  It
is suspected that the committee meets in the Conference Room located on that
station.

Lillian says, "Thought."
nod
You nod.
Melinda says to Lillian, "Yeah, if we want a long lasting one, we'll have to get
one of the experts. Apparently I can do a few week one."
Lillian nods to Melinda. "That should work out then, but I had a thought."
Lily says, "Yeah you have to be Expert to create a larger coverage and longer
duration chart."
Lillian says to Melinda, "Do you have to be able to read coreward to read a
chart you made?"
Melinda says to Lillian, "No, Spinward."

I read it? I've tried just about everything. And it's not at the mail center..."

seven days."

you got your mail a while back."

then checked the notification it'll still be there."

you read it."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok that makes sense. Thanks!"
Lily says, "They say the longer the array can observe, the better the results."
"The aquarium is coreward but," says Melinda, "wherever I go create a chart, it
will be my native notation so to speak."
Lillian says to Melinda, "Right I get that, but if you make a coreward chart,
because the aquarium is coreward, don't you have to be able to read coreward
charts to actually use it?"
A dark shape flits past the viewport.
Lillian says, "I feel like that needs to be tested."
Lillian says, "Unless it already has."
"I can't write a chart in the coreward notation because I can't read it,"
Melinda says. "So, any chart I write up will be spinward no matter where it is."
Lillian Hudson says into the hypercaster microphone, "I just saw a space fish.
Or at least, something flitted outside the window. I claim it was a space fish.
Or maybe a rift fish... Do you think they're different?"
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South and Very Slightly Down:
"Of course."
Lily laughs.
Lily says, "Or some weird bird."
Lillian says, "That makes sense."
Lillian nods to Lily.
"Or a huuuuuge bug!" exclaims Lily.

"Shule won't do it," says Rogue. "So you got to."
Lillian says to Melinda, "No, we don't have to wait. Well we'll have to wait a
couple months probably, but a couple weeks may be enough. At the very least, we
get an aquarium trip."
Blake says, "Shule can do it in my place."
Rogue frowns at Blake.

be able to make that one too."
Lily says, "Not sure if will make it to Keegan's as per usual, he's playing
Keegan politics."
Rogue sighs.
"I forget where keegan's planning to go, but I do know I wanted to try to get on
that one." Lillian nods to Melinda. "It looks like my vacation may be a lot
longer than I originally thought though, so his trip is probably out of the
question."
"I don't like you no mo Blake.." Rogue says in a Ticulian accent.
Melinda says, "He did say for everybody to write him if he hadn't spoke with
them recently about the trip."
Blake says to Rogue, "Wait. You liked me before?"
Rogue says to Blake in a Ticulian accent, "Duh?"
Blake grins at Rogue.
"Okay," says Lillian, "I think it's time for me to get some sleep."

"Well he told me a few times that he wanted my Long-Range so yeah I assumed he
had me on the short list but yes I did write to him but then he said he had room
for one of us but someone would have to be dropped for both of us to go," Lily
says.
"See you guys later," says Lillian. "I may wake up at an odd time."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She is wearing a light blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and
cuffs and a pair of soft electric blue boots.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.
