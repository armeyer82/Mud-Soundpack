Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Desiree the little black
and white spotted CatBot, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white
rattan coffee table with a glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a
small white trash bin, a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage
container, a robotic chef named Nellie, a red plastic food storage container, an
insulated blue cooler, a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt, Purr the
humanoid service robot, and Buddy the hefty blue soldier felo here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

Meow the little calico CatBot
A classic four-legged, long-tailed feline shape rendered in soft plastic, this
adorable little robotic pet moves with the aid of hydraulic actuators and
compact transistors. Its molded catlike form is made of durable calico-color
plastic, and it has a pair of blue eyes that glow softly. Printed on its belly
are the words, "CatBot 8000: A RobCo product!"

[Starship "Tocada And Feud"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

You are taking on 20 enemy ships in a fighter?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I took on four destroyers and
two gunships."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If they were all fully crewed,
and it looked like they were, that was 22 people against me."

single Thrall fighter in my fighter and lost my ship. Call me impressed."

made them all run away."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If I'd had another person along,
in a corvette perhaps or just a second fighter, we could probably have actually
destroyed some of them."
[General Communication] Klave Andaran transmits, "It seem like I have a lot to
learn. I love fighting in my fighter - I'm just not all that skilled yet. It's
good to know what could be done in a fighter. Gives me something to aspire to."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'm not even the best in a
fighter."
Lily Kaise tunes a metachannel FTL communicator.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Klave the trick with fighters is
basically to practice with them and learn the rhythm for fighting in it."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I mean, there's more to it, but
the fundamental part is timing your attacks, your movements, your repairs, your
everything."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "A lot of people learn each thing
as its own topic, which is good. You can certainly do that in larger ships where
you're focusing on one job because your crew is doing the other jobs."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "But even once you have mastery
of all that, you still need to practice doing them all alone in a fighter."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "The first real solo fight I had
was me in a rental fighter against a single IFS warship, an aeries."
[General Communication] Klave Andaran transmits, "I agree. My timing is all off.
I try to move as soon as I get locked, then fire but I think my reactions are
still a bit slow."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met our
first tier performance goal! Let's keep pushing for the second!"
[General Communication] Klave Andaran transmits, "I also still get all muddled
under the preassure. I have to remind myself to slow down and think things
throught every once in a while."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "That gets better with practice
too."
[General Communication] Klave Andaran transmits, "Now I'm feeling all inspired.
I'll have to go and rent or buy a new fighter and give it another go soon."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
[General Communication] Klave Andaran transmits, "Does anyone know if Helios can
be reached via ITPN?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Oh. No."

Gateway, then you can get to Helios."

This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small
sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some
effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be
completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several
grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. The status
lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in a garage.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "Courageous"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Courageous"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go down and out.

kiss lily
You kiss Lily Kaise.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
},m>c/YtEeR"|LE0bHrddOfe*ghe-I'^cX}x`b?5
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
Lily Kaise kisses you.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, welcome to Belt of Orion. As you travel to the bubble or one of the
asteroid stations, fly safe, keep an eye on your charge and make sure to have
enough EAOS credits for the tolls. Have a nice day!"
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
