Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. The status lights overhead
are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi Shule!"
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
1"UTN15_/GNt@S]n:KwZ94JY:tC@QX^HC@Z='C0g
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

Though most cultures have blended over the years, old Mexican culture still
thrives here. Children from nearby apartment buildings play in small yards
ringed with chain link fencing. Faint phrases of the old language can barely be
made out as mothers converse with their children and neighbors. The scent of
Mexican food swims inside your nostrils from a small restaurant to the side of
the street.
You can go southeast and northwest.

[New Phoenix; Japan Boulevard]
Though not completely restored, the old office buildings along this part of
Japan Boulevard are already home to new businesses. Two new shops are directly
next to each other in the same building: 'Freneza,' which has in its front
windows displays of hosiery, belts, and odd-looking bracelets; and 'Studdedly,'
which occupies the corner of the building and advertises with hand-made signs
its low-priced stock of wrist bands and chokers. A number of glum and edgy
people seem to hang around these shops, their spiked hair and unique dress
setting them apart from the usual shoppers.

Ancient office buildings dominate this block. In their worn and dirty brick
facades and crumbling ornamental designs, many of them bear signs of having
fallen into disrepair. In spite of this, new business are moving in, including
an old but ornate building on the south side of the boulevard that is now
occupied by a clothing store called 'The Brink.' Darkly dressed but relatively
quiet individuals hang around the entrance.

This block of Japan Boulevard has recently begun a commercial rejuvenation.
Where it was somewhat rundown before the war, the infusion of money from private
businesses has brought a new atmosphere of bustle and success to the area. On
the lower floor of a brick building on the northern side of the street, a
delightful-looking breakfast restaurant with a large plate glass window in the
front has just opened. 'Colt's Kitchen and Catering' is painted across the
window in cheerful red letters. The Boulevard continues both to the east and
west.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

Dear Kim, Shule, and Angel,
Anfisa, Nissi, Liam, Morris, and myself have headed off aboard Metal Heart to
rendezvous with Yadira Rivera, Keegan's tactical exploration platform. We are
performing the rendezvous for reasons that are very important to Anfisa and
Nissi. We will need some help from you to make sure that both ships can find
each other. 
Using course information that Yadira Rivera sent through the QE comm, we have
set our course to 75 2 from Coreward Reach. Please set the Torus hypercaster to
that heading. Use power setting 70%. I have asked Sakura, Zandria, and any other
Business Cats who are available to help with our slot from the 2300 to 2359
period, so between your rental time and ours we can achieve a two hour block of
broadcast time.
Since both Metal Heart and Yadira Rivera have QE comms, it is possible for
people here at home to relay a message from one ship to the other, either by
repeating the message over the hypercaster relay channel during the rental
times, or by sending a QE message from Accord of Free Worlds command station to
the intended ship. Since we'll be searching a fairly large area for the
rendezvous, any help you can provide in helping the two ships maintain
communication is very much appreciated.
Sincerely,
-Akemi Bando

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a
painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a greater minimodule of
minidrones boost, a greater minimodule of energy capacity and energy generation,
an insulated red cooler, a blue plastic food storage container, and a
pocket-sized purple holovid here.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a soft mystic purple nightshirt with the Business Cats logo on
the front. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced
plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, both knees,
both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

they should meet on the 40 using Torus NDB was a bit too hopeful and not the
right way of doing it. Since that alone covers a significant part of space that

if they were heading in the same direction and using pings."

have to send message from one to the other. Since they can't communicate to each
other directly so it's a bit. What's the word. Exausting?"

I appreciate it."

find each other for months, even if the flow was directly in your faver and

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Battery-Powered Temporary
Station; Docking Bay.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[General Communication] Melissa Cantrelle transmits, "I think we're half tempted
to do that anyway."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "I almost did that last night.
But. Was too nice. But after a shit sleep cuz I was afraid I'd miss something
important."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "I hope what ever anfisa and
nissy have to meet up about is worth it..."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Either way, you're almost off
the hook if they're at 62% on the NDB already."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Personally they should of
just tried to find a point of interest out there, then charted to it, that may
of been easier to meet up at."

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There also could've been the
case that it might not be in range of any of their charts, which is also a
possibility. Depends on how far they are."

[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "That doesn't sound good."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, it is possible to run
an expedition without a charter on the ship, you just have to be a bit more
careful and do a few more calculations in your head than might seem normal.
Especially as of late with the increasing rift unpredictabilities."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "A few months? It's probably
been over a year since Deitz's thing."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Good point. I don't have a
problem taking a charter, but, 3? Uh. Yes I'd love to get my own exploration
ship some day, but.. that's not for a year or more by my guess to get points and
to learn more."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee appliqued with small neon pink
dragonflies, a pair of skinny blue low rise jeans, and a pair of hot pink canvas
sneakers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head,

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is
detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The
transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it
for a moment.
Lily Kaise resets the starship's mileage meter.
Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.
Lily Kaise activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Docking Bay.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a

minidrones boost, Kiska the humanoid service robot, an insulated red cooler, a

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

The starship has left a unique area of space.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sky blue cotton chemise trimmed with delicate battenburg lace.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is at League Recharging Battery-Powered Temporary Station; Docking
Bay.

I'm offering this for an asking price of 220 million EAOS, or for a trade of 20
RATS quicksynth, 20 RATS nanite capacitor parts, and one set of alien
maintenance tools plus a crafting fee of 20 million EAOS. This toolset is used
for building improved consumable engineering tools, which are appropriate for
pilots who have 500 industry points or more on their license.

You peer south...
[Starship "Seventh Star"; Storage Room]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Recharging Battery-Powered Temporary
Station; Docking Bay.
You see a very soft quilted light purple sleeping mat with a large lavender bed
pillow on it, a large turquoise quilt with an appliqued magenta and white lotus
blossom design, a personal hoverpallet, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and a Tardick lizard named
Asteria here.
You can go north.

You peer down...
[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at League Recharging Battery-Powered Temporary Station;
Docking Bay.
You see a small white trash bin, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a
painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a greater minimodule of
minidrones boost, Kiska the humanoid service robot, an insulated red cooler, a
compact red refrigerator, a red plastic food storage container, a clear plastic
food storage container, a blue plastic food storage container, an insulated
green cooler, an AEU Combat Universalist, and a League Paladin here.
You can go up and out.

a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined
sugar maple trees
Molded as though covered by a tablecloth, this round table of finely grained
plastic is painted an overall deep sapphire blue. In the center of the table top
are the intertwined roots of four sugar maple trees, each extending from the
center of the table to one of the sides and representing a season on Old Earth.
The spring tree has new light green foliage, the summer tree has dark green
leaves lightly dusted with yellow flowers, the autumn tree is covered in leaves
of deep red, orange, and yellow, and the bare branches of the winter tree spring
out and upward from the trunk, forming a complex oval against the table top's
background. The entire table is lacquered for a hard, resilient finish.
On top of it you see a small cat whittled from maple, a small hot coffee
dispenser, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot tea dispenser, a bulky
cylinder with a vaguely spout-like protrusion on the top, an elegant crystal
decanter, a compact purple microwave oven, a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a
long-sleeved dark blue tee appliqued with small neon pink dragonflies, and a
pair of skinny blue low rise jeans.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sky blue cotton chemise trimmed with delicate battenburg lace.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is
detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The
transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

#help script
Command: #script {variable} {shell command}

         The script command works much like the system command except that it
         treats the generated echos as commands if no variable is provided.

         This is useful for running php, perl, ruby, and python scripts. You
         can run these scrips either from file or from within tintin if the
         scripting language allows this.

         If you provide a variable the output of the script is stored as a list.

Example: #script {ruby -e 'print "#showme hello world"'}
Example: #script {python -c 'print "#showme hello world"'}
Example: #script {php -r 'echo "#showme hello world"'}
Example: #script {path} {pwd};#showme The path is $path[1].
[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

#help run
Command: #run {session name} {shell command}

         The run command works much like the system command except that it
         runs the command in a pseudo terminal. The run command also creates
         a session that treats the given shell command as a mud server. This
         allows you to run ssh, as well as any other shell application, with
         full tintin scripting capabilities

Example: #run {somewhere} {ssh someone@somewhere.com}
Example: #run {something} {tail -f chats.log}

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the
collar and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and a soft fuchsia Tardick
lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and
both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a cup of hot French vanilla coffee in her right hand.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

You stand before Shule Elemmire's workbench and gather various supplies, then
skillfully assemble them into a small self-sustaining power source.
(30 seconds roundtime.)
You arrange a small self-sustaining power source among the workbench's supplies.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I suppose you want to go to the Xeno
station? I forgot to transfer so I need to go as well."
Lily Kaise grins at you.
'Oh, sure.
You say, "Oh, sure."

Wait 8 seconds.
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
You stand before Shule Elemmire's workbench and gather various supplies, then
skillfully assemble them into a small self-sustaining power source.
(30 seconds roundtime.)
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
You add a small self-sustaining power source to the workbench's supplies, for a
total of two.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Actually thought someone else would as
there were two transports."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
'Ah, ok.
You say, "Ah, ok."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
5*lv*709s"DRRt@VagK~aMBCLN+/GMd]8!o#L`iG
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
You stand before Shule Elemmire's workbench and gather various supplies, then
skillfully assemble them into a small self-sustaining power source.
(30 seconds roundtime.)
You add a small self-sustaining power source to the workbench's supplies, for a
total of three.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2418 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Westsouthwest and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'William Dove.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Unmanned Pickup

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Davion James"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

Hi, Kim. First, I would love the ability to rent a medium transport at 350. I
think I can't buy mine til 500, so renting one for salvage ops would be
wonderful.
I don't really have an opinion on the fighters, so will stay away from that one.
We talked recently about the possibility of a rentable roid hauler with
upgrades. I'm sure you know, as I stated at the time, that would make me
tremendously happy.

I love the ability to rent starships from the org, period. I think that will
help less experienced pilots out, and just benifit everyone.

Hi, yes, we are not getting rid of the rentable ships. I just would like to make
sure the ships we offer and the ships you guys need or like are the same thing.

Subject: About org ships, your opinions needed
Author: Kim Saunders
Posted: 13:14 11 July 2316 GST

Hi Starseekers,
I have been going over the ships we currently have, a total of 23. Most of these
are available for rent in some form or another. Now it's not a problem for
Starseekers to keep these ships, but I would prefer that the ships we have are
something you need. So, any comments or questions about ships are welcome. A few
particular things below.
Currently Starseekers has 2 fighters, a hyperion electronic warfair which is
barely upgraded, and a heavy fighter. We could keep both, or 1, or get rid of
them, we could upgrade them, and we could get a bastille.
then, is anyone looking to rent a light transport? If so, what level of upgrades
do you think it should have.
I think I will give the medium transport a little bit of a downgrade so people
with 350 industry can rent it.
these are my thoughts and questions for now, feel free to express yourselves,
it's what this board is here for!
Kim

Transports:
Two-Person Light Transport 15,000,000.00 (Old Earth in the city of Cherise)
U-5 UNITED FREIGHT D'INTSEC FIREFLY-CLASS LIGHT TRANSPORT
Class: Transport
Requirements: 30 industry points        0 combat points
Model number: U-5                       Designation: Light Transport
Turret hardpoints: 1                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 35000        Standard battery hours: 4
Docking bay size required: 77
If you want to finally salvage or trade with something better than your cargo
hauler, then the light transport is the best ship for you in the next line of
upgrades. It's not as well armed as the cargo hauler, but holds a lot more
debris.
Two-Person Medium Transport 375,000,000.00 (Old Earth in the city of Cherise)
U-2 UNITED FREIGHT D'INTSEC SERENDIPITY-CLASS MEDIUM TRANSPORT
Class: Transport
Requirements: 700 industry points       0 combat points
Model number: U-2                       Designation: Medium Transport
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 60000        Standard battery hours: 6
Docking bay size required: 96
The Medium Transport is currently the best ship that an AEU pilot can get for
salvaging and trading. This will show even more when a pilot can upgrade its
cargo hold to the highest storage extender.

Subject: About org ships, your opinions needed
Author: Kim Saunders
Posted: 13:14 11 July 2316 GST

Hi Starseekers,
I have been going over the ships we currently have, a total of 23. Most of these
are available for rent in some form or another. Now it's not a problem for
Starseekers to keep these ships, but I would prefer that the ships we have are
something you need. So, any comments or questions about ships are welcome. A few
particular things below.
Currently Starseekers has 2 fighters, a hyperion electronic warfair which is
barely upgraded, and a heavy fighter. We could keep both, or 1, or get rid of
them, we could upgrade them, and we could get a bastille.
then, is anyone looking to rent a light transport? If so, what level of upgrades
do you think it should have.
I think I will give the medium transport a little bit of a downgrade so people
with 350 industry can rent it.
these are my thoughts and questions for now, feel free to express yourselves,
it's what this board is here for!
Kim

Hi Everyone,
I think we should get rid of one of the fighters. The electronic warfare fighter
is barely functional. I used it to do a standard beacon and I swear I grew 100
years older before I completed it. Ok, a bit of an exaggeration, but the point
is that it took forever! So, I vote we get rid of it, keep the heavy fighter and
buy a bastille. I'd be happy to outfit the bastille if we decide to purchase
one.
In terms of the light transport, it only requires 30 industry and 15 mill to
purchase. This is pretty easily obtainable for even newer pilots. If we
downgrade the medium transport so that it can be rented with 350 industry, I
think it'll serve most of the org members except the really newer pilots. In
short, I don't really see a point in having a light transport. Just my thoughts.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, Purr
the humanoid service robot, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the
humanoid service robot, and Jewel the large violet glowing felo here.
You can go south and out.
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles
around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the

narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting
everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of
each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news
broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the

Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The glory of the endless expanse of starry space is revealed here through the
transparent dome over this small but elegant restaurant. A spiral staircase in
the center of the restaurant leads down to the main level of the station, and
luxurious black carpeting covers the floor, extending outward to a long
silver-trimmed black plasteel bar encircling the room. Cushioned black leather
bar stools are arranged along the bar, and on the other side is a black plasteel
waiter droid which moves with quiet efficiency to fill customers' orders. A
two-meter-high wall of shiny black plasteel around the outside of the bar
contains notices and a few other photographs and mementos. You see a framed
photo of several pilots gleefully kicking a downed Outsider, a large glossy
framed photo of Benjamin Masterson, a large glossy photo of a beautiful green
planet in space, a small photograph of a pile of burning money, and a large
glossy AFW promotional poster hanging on various walls.

Hello Pilots, I have reserved the time slot of 1500 to 15:59 GST for The Torus
Hyperwave on behalf of SEAS. I will maintain this slot for as long as it is
viable. You do not need to be a member of SEAS to utilize it. However, I please
ask that you use it for responsible Exploration related communications.

[The Torus; Torus Restaurant]
The glory of the endless expanse of starry space is revealed here through the
transparent dome over this small but elegant restaurant. A spiral staircase in
the center of the restaurant leads down to the main level of the station, and
luxurious black carpeting covers the floor, extending outward to a long
silver-trimmed black plasteel bar encircling the room. Cushioned black leather
bar stools are arranged along the bar, and on the other side is a black plasteel
waiter droid which moves with quiet efficiency to fill customers' orders. A
two-meter-high wall of shiny black plasteel around the outside of the bar
contains notices and a few other photographs and mementos. You see a framed
photo of several pilots gleefully kicking a downed Outsider, a large glossy
framed photo of Benjamin Masterson, a large glossy photo of a beautiful green
planet in space, a small photograph of a pile of burning money, and a large
glossy AFW promotional poster hanging on various walls.
You see a sleek black trash bin, a sleek Torus hyperwave relay interface, a
black and white payphone, a projector, and an ice sculpture of Benjamin
Masterson here.
