A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights
glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and
debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now
only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from
each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight
seat molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden
of acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity
dampening system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight
cabin, with the starship's main computer right up against the back of the
seat. A rather sparse flight control board is presented claustrophobicall
y close to the pilot's face. It seems to lack any sort of manual control,
allowing only automatic flight profiles to be entered into an antiquated
flight computer. It does, however, possess controls to operate a single
small turret. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights
glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and
debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now
only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from
each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most
heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the
heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will
automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless
aborted or another navigation order is entered."

[Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits
protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of
the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a
view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have
eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.
Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing
essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a
working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though
the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire
architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.
The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious
area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the
ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while,
something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of
static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the
following: 3E`]4d}k:|p<Pd,eK1~/aDp'}0R?bPIbWIpyr)u2
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but
there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd
cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral
snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like
a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's
computer cannot pinpoint a source.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective
history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By
the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has
spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an
alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First
contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then
the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one
by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five
years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space,
bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this,
and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off
human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has
lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of
it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any
new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that
most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your
species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while
on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long
counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks
have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to
the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that
the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep
purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle
