The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

16:31 You hear the distinct hiss of water being pumped through the ship's piping. Moments later, a flurry of frozen water crystals begins to drift down from vents in the ceiling, lazily swirling through currents of air being pumped out until it settles on the deck plating, where it immediately melts into a hazardous water puddle.

17:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward an asteroid.

17:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off as the ship sets down on the asteroid's surface.

17:22 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

23:03 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a seashell-shaped ocean blue Hawaiian ginger air freshener, and a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall here.
You can go south.

For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of faded blue jeans with metal studs around the back pockets over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a dragon-shaped gold ring with a thin sign engraved into it, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, and a red spacesuit navigational computer.
