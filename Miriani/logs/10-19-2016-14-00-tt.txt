Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
nG,&Uv;)Kkro?-=v%6Us!|+fFkXUAY1MT@PEI7mq
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our two asteroid hauling stations,
remember to stay safe, keep a check on your charge and please have EAOS credits
on hand for the tolls."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2262 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Southsouthwest and Down."
A large gas giant floats here, glowing bright white in the light of its suns.
The surface appears regular and still, but certainly that's merely an illusion.

changelog
Recent Major Changes:
-----
Blast Furnace Overhaul!
For a long time it's been noted that the blast furnace is better than all other
power source options, and we agree! One big reason for that is that it recharges
a ship practically instantaneously, and that any debris can be used with equal
gains!
Well, no more! Debris now has a specific fusion value, where materials such as
hydrogen are far superior to materials such as iron or starship components,
whereas water is somewhere in the middle, so oort clouds and stellar nurseries
suddenly got a lot more appealing to visit!
Additionally, recharging now takes time after you finish shovelling debris, and
this is a much quicker process if the debris that has been salvaged is more
fusible. However, during the recharging period, your ship cannot enter the rift.
However, you can move normally in realspace during this time - the ship will be
rather vulnerable, but not completely helpless.
Finally, shovelling debris is now a continuous action, instead of one that you
have to mash as vigorously as possible. Also, we have added some additional
touches for realism.
Not to worry, the overall endurance from a blast furnace remains unchanged -
even if you're forced to use poorly fusible materials in a pinch, you'll get the
same overall range... but recharging stops will take much longer and you'll need
much more debris!
Note: Currently extant debris doesn't have its proper recharge value, this new
change only applies to newly-salvaged debris.

[Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The landing pad, like all exterior portions of the facility, is covered with a
giant Faraday cage which keeps out the electrical blasts that are hurled down
from the sky on a regular basis. To stand in when the cage is opened, such as
when a starship is departing or arriving, a number of tall lightning rods
surround the pad, each attached to a drooping grounding wire that buries itself
in the ground.
The two-person Accord gemini "Sg 8", the four-person mule "ShadowHawk", the
opochtli "Mouse Noise (Squeak Was Taken)", the two-person Accord gemini "Nebula
Flame", the two-person Accord gemini "Javelle", the two-person Accord gemini

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

I am leaving October on 20 for a short upgrade trip. Assuming that all will go
fine, we should be home in just a few days.
If one of the stations I build goes down, I will have parts on my Cats parts
ship for somebody to use.

Subject: Rift School: October 21
Author: Akemi Bando
Posted: 03:38 20 October 2316 GST

Anyone is welcome to come! People with little or no experience using rift ships
are who this is intended for, but even if you've made many trips and gotten out
of all sorts of scrapes you're welcome to come too. This is going to be a short
trip, from Gateway to Helios. We will meet up in Tandem station, dock beta, at
0030 on October 21st. This trip shouldn't take more than four hours at most (and
probably less).
I intend to cover the basics of: 
*Adjusting ship heading
*Using non-directional beacon locators for navigation
*Using rift beacon autotravel navigation from a deep space start
*Ship system power management
*Ship sensor signature management
*Hypercaster use as a navigation aid
*Appropriate use of active long range scanner systems
*Terminal approach techniques
This is taking place after Melinda's trip has left. If you're going on her trip,
I expect you'll learn much the same skills from her and her crew.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in a garage.

This is a tank for holding critters!
It is filled with water.
It is open.
Inside it you see a white plastic undersea castle, a plastic wrecked AEU
Soothsayer, a corpse of a tiny sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with
fan-like fins, and a corpse of a small sleek speckled amber aquatic creature
with hexagonal fins.
It appears that there are ample food particles in the water.
A short violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles, a small
sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with rounded fins, a large sleek speckled
amber aquatic creature with pentagonal fins, a small sleek speckled white
aquatic creature with frilled fins, a large sleek speckled crimson aquatic
creature with pentagonal fins, a small sleek speckled violet aquatic creature
with pentagonal fins, a small sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with
hexagonal fins, a large sleek speckled crimson aquatic creature with pentagonal
fins, and a large sleek speckled amber aquatic creature with rounded fins are

That's nine creatures, and the tank could probably safely hold six more.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
rJ%S:7a8F\k()p.,fR#T0GU~JX$*:lkM(l7>#2.k
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The motion of the ship throws your body from side to side, but your seatbelt
holds you in place.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Shooting Star. Welcome to Accord space."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
CmqRoSd8W?`Q`dhq571LTNx{tOs{V$'SAimCkKr@
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our two asteroid hauling stations,
remember to stay safe, keep a check on your charge and please have EAOS credits
on hand for the tolls."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2024 light-minutes per second from Galactic Southeast
and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 7,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do
you wish to pay this?
[Enter `yes' or `no']
y
You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's

The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four.
You see a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver
fringe and a comfy neon purple Business Cats floor pillow here.

sit pillow
You sit down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick
silver fringe.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
eLrn&j\>4/J(r2@3bw^0:a4f/LP7#xLA:}2P1</e
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our two asteroid hauling stations,
remember to stay safe, keep a check on your charge and please have EAOS credits
on hand for the tolls."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2046 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Southsoutheast and Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
ftl accord
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

This part of the spaceport has a fresh new look. Numerous pilot services are
available from the facilities here, including from the new Unreality Programming
office to the south, where a bold green and white banner announces: 'Employment
Opportunities! Apply inside!' Next to it, the spaceport's ship store competes
with a brand new flashing sign reading: 'Ship Sales! Don't be grounded!' Between
them, nearly hidden behind a potted plant is a wide stairway leading downward to
a lower level of the spaceport. A small sign near the stairway reads: Aerial
Fortresses and Supply. Other areas of interest here are the Fund Center to the
northwest, the pawn shop to the north, and the trading center to the northeast.

[Starship "Unreality Programming 812"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
R/fTsyAG?5FJBo^^2q(']aw9'?z8K?R5eGF`Tda4
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
