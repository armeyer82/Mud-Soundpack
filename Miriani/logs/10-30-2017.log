Built into the upper layers of the planet's surface, this bare room has long since been abandoned. The metal floor is rusted through in places, and large holes have been gouged out of the gray plaster walls. A solar battery has been mounted to the ceiling which is set with a row of lights giving off a dim yellow illumination. A few broken mining axes lie in the far corner. A battered metal table leans against one wall, its two broken legs lying on the floor beside it. A large doorway leads to the northeast and a short set of metal steps leads down into semi-darkness. The occasional spark arcs off the airlock in the ceiling from which dangles a rope ladder.

The reinforced steel of this massive landing site gleams in the multitude of lights glittering from the massive spaceport tower to the north. The curved structure spears up towards the sky, its exterior marked and colored with a vast array of murals and messages. Its many windows glow with blazing light, and enormous colored spotlights cast their beams down from the very top of the tower. A sculpted granite archway leads into the spaceport, and above it is a gold embossed plaque with engraved letters which read, Miriani Spirit tower. A lighted sign directing pilots to the spaceport garage is visible off to the left above a set of gleaming metal stairs which lead downward. In the far distance, at the gated edge of the landing site, there appears to be a small brick structure with several people gathered around it.

02:55 You are carrying nothing.

02:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

02:55 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:58 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

02:58 [General Communication] Justin Stroup transmits, "Here."

02:58 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

02:58 You peer out and see...

02:58 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the one-person fighter "Sands of Time" powered down here.
You see the three-person voyager "Shardlight" and the three-person antagonizer "Mean Machine" landed here.
You see Gee the droid, Larry the droid, Yelp the droid, Cyrax the droid, Cylinder the droid, Torri the droid, Fisher the droid, Ketemmex the droid, Ramzi the droid, Angela the droid, Gamma the droid, Nia the droid, Marcus the droid, Dell the droid, Jade the droid, and Shade the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, and south.

03:05 ["Nightingale" Weapons Room 2] (indoors) (sitting on a black velvet recliner with rubies in the arms)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a black velvet recliner with rubies in the arms here.
You can go south.

03:05 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

03:05 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "in 2"

03:05 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

03:05 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

03:05 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

03:05 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

03:05 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

03:05 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

03:06 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

03:06 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

03:06 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

03:06 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

03:06 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

03:06 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:06 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:06 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights continue to flash overhead.

03:06 Michael Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "we do have pulses, if you get bored kitty"

03:06 Kitty Mars's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "ok good deal"

A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the six-person sentinel "Nightingale" and the one-person fighter "Iron Madman" landed here.
You see Ah the droid, Liyah the droid, Writhe the droid, Doogie the droid, Clank the droid, Smoke the droid, Karmen the droid, Cally the droid, Delilah the droid, Amgad the droid, Ambrose the droid, Chasling the droid, Alpha the droid, Ryan the droid, Cari the droid, and Kitty the droid here.
You see Ray Ridgeway and Jake Billings here.
You can go north, southeast, and southwest.

13:32 Jake Billings's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "okay bak in a said"

13:32 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] You transmit, "How goes?"

13:32 Jake Billings's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "sec"

13:32 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "how goes things with you friend! it goes well!"

13:32 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] You transmit, "It's going great."

13:33 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] Ray Ridgeway transmits, "rumor had it that you were considering retiring from piloting at one point. Hopefully you've reconsidered?"

13:33 [Private | Ray Ridgeway] You transmit, "Yeah, the rumors were true, but some very convincing people talked some sense into me."

13:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

13:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:34 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:35 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:35 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

13:35 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

13:35 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

13:35 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

13:35 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

13:35 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:35 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:35 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:45 You peer northwest and see...

13:45 ["Pop Goes The Prailer" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white tiled floor. You see a polished circular mirror in a smooth ebony frame carved with vines and a wooden frame containing a picture of Ralph the Monkey triumphantly holding up a banana hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the frosted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a marble window box, a cream plush rug, a compact black refrigerator, an elegant cream engineer's chair, a gray bamboo waste basket, a large wooden table with a centerpiece of a holographic star system, and an internal stun turret here.
You see Therman Donaldson (sitting on an elegant cream engineer's chair) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

13:45 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

13:46 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

13:46 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

13:46 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

13:46 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:46 You hear a buzzing sound from the hull as repairs continue.

14:25 You peer northwest and see...

14:25 ["Pop Goes The Prailer" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white tiled floor. You see a polished circular mirror in a smooth ebony frame carved with vines and a wooden frame containing a picture of Ralph the Monkey triumphantly holding up a banana hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the frosted window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see a marble window box, a cream plush rug, a compact black refrigerator, an elegant cream engineer's chair, a gray bamboo waste basket, a large wooden table with a centerpiece of a holographic star system, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

14:25 [Short-range Communication] Aaron Blade transmits, "Yo."

14:25 You remove a droid remote titled "rolukssica" from a black leather briefcase.

14:25 [Short-range Communication] Jake Billings transmits, "Hush."

14:25 [Short-range Communication] Aaron Blade transmits, "Nooo."

14:26 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The two-person vanguard "Oregon" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

14:26 [Short-range Communication] Jake Billings transmits, "Ye, good point."

14:26 [Short-range Communication] Jessica Marin transmits, "Here."

14:27 You hear somebody knocking on the hull.

14:27 You access a silver portable point unit and note you have 5479.03 license points and 4412.06 combat points.

14:30 The noises coming from the storage room gradually cease until they can be heard no more.

14:30 Your communicator confirms a private link with Jessica Marin.

14:30 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

14:30 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Pop Goes The Prailer" has launched from Rolukssica.

14:30 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

14:30 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

14:31 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

14:32 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

14:32 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Pop Goes The Prailer" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

14:32 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

14:32 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

14:32 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

14:32 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

14:32 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

14:32 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

14:32 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

14:32 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

15:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:17 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:17 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

15:18 You are carrying an application for the ten-person battlecruiser in your left hand and a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in your right hand.

15:18 Please be aware of the following basic guidelines for battlecruiser ownership:

* You must demonstrate the maturity to handle the ownership of such an advanced piece of technology. Monitors listen to the communicators and if you say that you are in league with the Praelor, are a child of a Praelor, have given birth to a Praelor, or otherwise have allegiances that conflict with those of the High Guard or your alliance, you will have your battlecruiser license revoked. Please note that this includes "renouncing" your alliance or the High Guard.

* You must use your battlecruiser in the defense of human space against targets the High Guard has deemed threatening, such as Praelor or rogue human pilots.

* Your battlecruiser rights will be revoked should you attack sectors 24 (High Guard Command) or 12 (Bellerophon), in any way, shape, or form. While the space station and Rolukssica base are equipped with defenses to deal with proximity weapons, blockades, and known enemy vessels, it is NOT there to clean up after irresponsible pilots. If you are found attempting to circumvent ANY defenses in High Guard space, your battlecruiser license will be revoked and may not be restored.

* Any action contrary to the goals of the High Guard, such as preventing combat missions, blockading the space station, blockading the mission jump gate, or otherwise interfering with High Guard operations is justification for the removal of these rights.

These are extremely basic guidelines. We will not attempt to spell out every specific situation, as it's your responsibility to make good decisions and judgement calls. By sending this application in, you are agreeing that your right to the battlecruiser class starship is at the sole discression of the joint committee for the regulation of advanced human war technoligies and may be revoked at any time for violating the above guidelines or in any situation the committee deems worthy of removal of these rights.

For more information on the battlecruiser testing process, please refer to message board post 13665.
You see some questions on an application for the ten-person battlecruiser...

1.) What is your name?

2.) How would you rate your combat abilities? Poor, average, excellent?

3.) Do you regularly participate in High Guard missions to protect known space?

4.) What would the primary purpose of a battlecruiser be in your fleet?

5.) What do you intend to name your battlecruiser?

6.) Imagine this hypothetical situation and describe how you would handle it. You're flying through uncharted space in your battlecruiser and you happen upon a lone Praelor starship. What do you do?

7.) Consider this situation: Praelor are invading known space and you find yourself on a planet with only two others. Your only option is to launch into a sector filled with Praelor who are probably swarming around the planet just waiting for you to launch. What do you do?

8.) Your friend has been 
15:18 kidnapped during an invasion and is currently being held prisoner on someone else's ship. You have a full crew together, and you could easily retrieve your friend. Do you stay and fight the Praelor, or do you rescue your friend?

9.) You're being continually harassed over the communicator by someone. They aren't causing you any physical harm, just insulting you. One day, you're in your battlecruiser and you see him salvaging. Do you attack him?

10.) Have you ever operated a starship or any other vehicle under the influence of a drug such as alcohol?

11.) Have you ever committed an act of random violence against an innocent creature, such as a proboscis monkey?

12.) Are you willing to have your battlecruiser destroyed in the defense of humanity?

13.) And finally, you are free to make any additional comments here.

15:21 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

15:21 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

15:21 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:22 The ship is already launching.

15:22 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

15:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:22 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

15:22 The ship is already in space.

15:22 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

15:22 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

15:22 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

15:22 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:22 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:22 The ship is already moving.

15:22 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:22 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

15:22 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:22 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

15:22 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:22 [General Communication] Jessica Marin transmits, "Only one spot. Come on."

15:22 Select a ship:

15:22 [1] the one-person expediter "Blue Star"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:22 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:22 The one-person expediter "Blue Star" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

15:22 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:22 Invalid selection.

15:22 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Rolukssica.

15:22 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:22 The three-person voyager "Syntaxi" has jumped into the sector.

15:22 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

15:22 [1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:22 The one-person expediter "Blue Star" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

15:22 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

15:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

15:23 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:23 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

15:23 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

15:48 Please be aware of the following basic guidelines for battlecruiser ownership:

* You must demonstrate the maturity to handle the ownership of such an advanced piece of technology. Monitors listen to the communicators and if you say that you are in league with the Praelor, are a child of a Praelor, have given birth to a Praelor, or otherwise have allegiances that conflict with those of the High Guard or your alliance, you will have your battlecruiser license revoked. Please note that this includes "renouncing" your alliance or the High Guard.

* You must use your battlecruiser in the defense of human space against targets the High Guard has deemed threatening, such as Praelor or rogue human pilots.

* Your battlecruiser rights will be revoked should you attack sectors 24 (High Guard Command) or 12 (Bellerophon), in any way, shape, or form. While the space station and Rolukssica base are equipped with defenses to deal with proximity weapons, blockades, and known enemy vessels, it is NOT there to clean up after irresponsible pilots. If you are found attempting to circumvent ANY defenses in High Guard space, your battlecruiser license will be revoked and may not be restored.

* Any action contrary to the goals of the High Guard, such as preventing combat missions, blockading the space station, blockading the mission jump gate, or otherwise interfering with High Guard operations is justification for the removal of these rights.

These are extremely basic guidelines. We will not attempt to spell out every specific situation, as it's your responsibility to make good decisions and judgement calls. By sending this application in, you are agreeing that your right to the battlecruiser class starship is at the sole discression of the joint committee for the regulation of advanced human war technoligies and may be revoked at any time for violating the above guidelines or in any situation the committee deems worthy of removal of these rights.

You see some questions on an application for the ten-person battlecruiser...

1.) What is your name?

2.) How would you rate your combat abilities? Poor, average, excellent?

3.) Do you regularly participate in High Guard missions to protect known space?

4.) What would the primary purpose of a battlecruiser be in your fleet?

5.) What do you intend to name your battlecruiser?

6.) Imagine this hypothetical situation and describe how you would handle it. You're flying through uncharted space in your battlecruiser and you happen upon a lone Praelor starship. What do you do?

7.) Consider this situation: Praelor are invading known space and you find yourself on a planet with only two others. Your only option is to launch into a sector filled with Praelor who are probably swarming around the planet just waiting for you to launch. What do you do?

8.) Your friend has been 
15:48 kidnapped during an invasion and is currently being held prisoner on someone else's ship. You have a full crew together, and you could easily retrieve your friend. Do you stay and fight the Praelor, or do you rescue your friend?

9.) You're being continually harassed over the communicator by someone. They aren't causing you any physical harm, just insulting you. One day, you're in your battlecruiser and you see him salvaging. Do you attack him?

10.) Have you ever operated a starship or any other vehicle under the influence of a drug such as alcohol?

11.) Have you ever committed an act of random violence against an innocent creature, such as a proboscis monkey?

12.) Are you willing to have your battlecruiser destroyed in the defense of humanity?

15:58 Please be aware of the following basic guidelines for battlecruiser ownership:

* You must demonstrate the maturity to handle the ownership of such an advanced piece of technology. Monitors listen to the communicators and if you say that you are in league with the Praelor, are a child of a Praelor, have given birth to a Praelor, or otherwise have allegiances that conflict with those of the High Guard or your alliance, you will have your battlecruiser license revoked. Please note that this includes "renouncing" your alliance or the High Guard.

* You must use your battlecruiser in the defense of human space against targets the High Guard has deemed threatening, such as Praelor or rogue human pilots.

* Your battlecruiser rights will be revoked should you attack sectors 24 (High Guard Command) or 12 (Bellerophon), in any way, shape, or form. While the space station and Rolukssica base are equipped with defenses to deal with proximity weapons, blockades, and known enemy vessels, it is NOT there to clean up after irresponsible pilots. If you are found attempting to circumvent ANY defenses in High Guard space, your battlecruiser license will be revoked and may not be restored.

* Any action contrary to the goals of the High Guard, such as preventing combat missions, blockading the space station, blockading the mission jump gate, or otherwise interfering with High Guard operations is justification for the removal of these rights.

16:03 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Blossom the droid, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Chops the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the dr
16:03 oid, Vur the droid, and Katherine the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

16:03 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

16:03 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

16:03 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

16:03 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

16:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

16:03 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

16:03 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

16:03 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:03 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:03 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

16:03 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

16:03 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:03 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

16:03 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:03 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

16:03 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

16:04 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

16:04 The computer announces, "Three planets have been detected in the sector."

16:04 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:04 Invalid selection.

16:04 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 6, 5, 1."

16:04 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:04 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:04 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:04 Invalid coordinates. Range: (1, 1, 1) to (20, 20, 20). You may also specify a destination name.

16:04 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:04 You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

16:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

16:05 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

16:05 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

16:05 You must stand up first.

16:05 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

16:05 You stand up.

17:10 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Lobbius; Landing Area.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a metallic red starship simulator, Mekensie the droid, and Kalista the droid here.
You can go south and out.

17:10 You peer out and see...

17:10 [Lobbius; Landing Area]
This small landing area appears to be setup just outside a massive crater. The ground surrounding the metal landing platform is bare brown rock which has several deep gouges in it. A metal fence rings the perimeter of a truly massive crater which spreads into the distance for as far as the eye can see to the north and east. A gate leading into the site bears a sign reading, Pilots only. To the west, a thin forest struggles to grow amid the barren landscape.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the six-person dart "Titanic" landed here.
You see an oddly shaped rock, fruitcake the droid, Tickle the droid, Wink the droid, a bunny-shaped espresso machine, a female food bot wearing a blutterfly-patterned t-shirt, a gleaming silver food robot, a food robot, FabioYobi the droid, Gracious the droid, Pandora the droid, and a glossy blue sanitation drone here.
You can go northwest, southeast, south, and west.

17:10 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

17:10 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

17:10 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

17:10 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

17:10 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

17:10 You begin the launch sequence.

17:10 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

17:10 The computer announces, "Three planets have been detected in the sector."

17:11 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:11 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

17:11 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

17:11 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

17:11 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

17:11 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

17:11 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

17:11 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

17:11 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

17:11 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

17:11 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

17:11 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

17:11 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

17:11 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

17:11 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

17:11 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

17:11 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:11 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

17:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

17:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

17:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

17:12 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

17:12 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

17:12 You must stand up first.

17:12 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

17:12 You stand up.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

Bathed in bright white lights, this enormous chamber houses the High Guard rearm facility. Most of the facility is cordoned off by warning tape that states only authorized personelle are allowed further into the complex. High on the ceiling are a series of tracks that drones zip to and fro on going up to the garage level and back, delivering bardenium to ships as well as toting bardenium storage boxes. A surly-looking droid in High Guard uniform patrols the shop, clipboard in robotic hands and asks patrons what they need. When it gets all the necessary information, it makes a note on its clipboard and sends a team of drones out. A menu terminal near the doorway displays bardenium costs as well as an interface for people to order their own rearmaments and storage boxes. A tall stone archway in the east wall leads to a proximity weapon store, and two human High Guard officers stand watch to either side of it, hands resting on holstered stun weapons.
You can go south.

19:34 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

19:34 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

19:34 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

20:51 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:51 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

20:51 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

20:51 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

20:51 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:51 Current coordinates: 11, 1, 6

20:51 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from red to yellow.

20:51 You hear the gentle hum begin to fade as the weapons power down.

20:52 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:52 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

20:52 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

20:52 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

20:52 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

20:52 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

20:52 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:52 Current coordinates: 3, 14, 7

20:52 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

20:52 You peer southeast and see...
["Al Nar" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an overstuffed gold engineer's chair, a violet armchair, and an internal stun turret here.
You see Calyssa Calaway (staring into space) here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

20:52 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:52 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:33 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

21:33 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

21:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

21:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

21:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

21:34 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:34 You're already sitting down.

21:34 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:34 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

21:34 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:34 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

21:34 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:34 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 7, 6."

21:34 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:34 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:34 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:34 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

21:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

21:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:35 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

21:35 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
