Moments later, a flurry of frozen water crystals begins to drift down from vents in the ceiling, lazily swirling through currents of air being pumped out until it settles on the deck plating, where it immediately melts into a hazardous water puddle.

00:43 --------------------------------------------------
Player-owned Space Stations, Moons, and Planets
--------------------------------------------------
PLANETS, MOONS, AND SPACESTATIONS:
Q: What do I need to get a planet, moon, or spacestation?
A: For spacestations, you need 10 billion credits and 10000 points. For moons, you need 20 billion credits and 15000 points. For planets, you need 30 billion credits and 25000 points. You also pay additional fees for each room you add.
Q: Where can I put my spacestation, planet, or moon?
A: In any sector, including places out of local space, except sector 24, sector 15, sector 12, sector 9, sector 13, sector 19, sector 0, sector 30, sector 115, sector 14 and sector 32. These sectors are subject to change and can be added to at any time.
Q: What can these fine places have?!
A: They can have an optional pool, an optional hot tub, and an optional private garage. You also may have a security center which allows you to control flight control and monitor rooms on the station, planet, or moon. You can also have a room that monitors the sector around your station, planet, or moon. Additionally, you're allowed to have five custom item stores for a station, seven custom item stores for a moon, and nine custom item stores for a planet. Any additional stores will have to be a tradesman item. Custom item stores are defined as stores with special clothing, food or other collectable items. You may have a transport pod as long as the station, p
00:43 lanet, or moon is not out of local space. Player-owned space stations, planets, and moons cannot contain facilities that allow for point transfers to take place, including artifact research centers, passenger transport facilities, etc. Stations, planets and moons cannot be self-contained. This means you cannot design a station that eliminates your need to travel to other planets to obtain specific services or goods. Example: starship registries.
Q: Can my station be armed?!?!
A: Sorry, no.
Q: Can I keep people out of my station, planet, or moon?
A: You can control flight control which will deny docking to a whole alliance, everybody but owners and caretakers, or specific ships based on your choice. If landing is disabled to all, even the ITPN station becomes non-functional.
Q: ITPN Stations??! Oh my oh my! What do they entail?!
A: All private space stations, moons and planets are required to have an ITPN station on them. These stations cannot be past a security checkpoint, meaning that everybody has to be able to get to them. ITPN stations may have only a single destination. The destination is determined by the sector that your private space station, moon or planet is in. If there is already a planet, moon or station in the sector you are building in, your ITPN destination goes to that location. Otherwise, the ITPN pod will go to the sector hub. That's Pax for sectors 1 through 20, and the ITPN hub in sector 33 for sec
00:43 tors 21 through 40. An example would be if a person build a moon in sector 31. There is a planet there with an ITPN station already, so the one on the private moon would go to that planet, which would then go to the hub. Private space stations, moons and planets not in a numbered sector can not have an ITPN station.

She has a green stamp of an oakleaf insignia on her left hand. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a fitted soft lavender purple linen spaghetti strap top decorated with white comets across the front. For a bottom, she is wearing a gauzy multi-colored knee-length skirt made of a translucent floaty material which is tied at the waist with a light purple scarf over a deep purple satin and lace g-string embroidered with hundreds of tiny diamonds. She is wearing a pair of white platform sandals on her feet. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a pink flight control scanner, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracel

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a 
19:40 velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt, Paws the droid, a black cat, a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes, a fluffy blue cat, Kissy the droid, Kitcat the droid, a transparent trash can, a large soft purple pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an orange tabby kitten, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a transparent architectural design simulator, Mekensie the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a bright turquoise cooler, a large sandstone fireplace with a stone harth and a teak mantel, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a stack of neatly split logs, a large white refrigerator, a compact bright red cooler with zip up compartments along the sides, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a pink handheld planetary surveyor here.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This thin woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She has a green stamp of an oakleaf insignia on her left hand. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.
The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
For a top, she is wearing a shimmering dark purple silk shoulder-bearing blouse with thin spaghetti straps and gold fringe around the top. For a bottom, she is wearing a delicately pleated lavender skirt over a violet silk g-string embroidered with tiny red roses. She is wearing a pair of white platform sandals on her feet. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a pink flight control scanner, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a long necklace made of smooth
22:13 ly polished light purple amethyst stones, a handmade ring made of amethyst and multi-colored stones, a cute tortie cat backpack, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a pink armor storage bag, a pink stun armor storage bag, a high-capacity pink Lore computer, a deep purple leather briefcase, a violet rolled toolkit, a purple diving gear bag, a small handheld radio receiver, a sleek hot pink repair kit, an asteroid hauling kit, a multi-strand of iridescent strawberry pearls, a seashell pink friendship bracelet with kitten-shaped beads, a silver ring with an amethyst gemstone, an amethyst crystal butterfly, a diamond Commoveo membership ring, a violet spacesuit jet, a violet spacesuit navigational computer, a bright pink snuggly holding an orange and white cat, and a small handheld mineral scanner.
She is carrying nothing.
