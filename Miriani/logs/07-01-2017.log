01:06 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

19:11 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

20:14 Announcement: A friendly warning that blowing up starships or otherwise taking advantage of circumstances presented to you by a server crash is heavily frowned upon. If people don't have a chance to reawaken and move themselves to somewhere safe, please do not destroy or steal their property. Typically, you should give someone at least an 8 to 12 hour window due to timezone differences to reconnect and move themselves to safety. Any instances of this happening will result in any in character gains being reversed, as well as the property restored to the victim. Thank you.

20:17 Announcement: And on the subject of server crashes, there was a minor rollback last night. If you lost any progress, please feel free to ASSIST to get it restored. I predict the issue causing panics will not occur again, but you never know!
