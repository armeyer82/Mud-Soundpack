Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a compact red
refrigerator, a small blue insulated cooler, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow
bowl, a high tech silver star print holovid, Magellan the arachnoid security
robot, Purr the humanoid service robot, a purple photocopier, a clear plastic
food storage container, a blue plastic food storage container, Kiska the
humanoid service robot, an unlabeled cerulean blue plastic box, and Samantha the
large violet felo here.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She is wearing a long-sleeved dark pink tee appliqued with small neon pink
dragonflies, a pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans with a small dark red 'XX'
embroidered on the left front pocket, and a pair of hot pink canvas sneakers.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.

Shule, I'm sitting on the couch in the Control Room of William Dove. I have
Magellan, Sassie on a leash and a hoverpallet following me. I put the aquariums
onto the hoverpallet. please put the bed on the hoverpallet as well. I'd prefer
not to take William Dove to old Earth and it be there for all that long but if
you forget and take us there, it's ok. If you have any extra felo chow bowls or
troughs, please bring them along with any fish food you have or felo chow. I
have put an extra bag of chow in Maria Mitchell who is in your ship and I did a
felo feeding from the Repair shop so your felo will be taken care of. Purr is
setup with 4 bags of chow plus the fish food it has in case an aquarium is left
behind. please take a look around in William Dove and pick up anything you see
that I might have overlooked. The last thing I need to do is pick up some food
to bring. please bring any that you have time to get. I should be back no later
than 2300 and can easily pickup food. I'm just planning for contingencies in
case I over sleep. Love you, - Lily

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Xavier the big silver soldier felo
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely wolf-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, spotted silver fur,
possessing a short, thin tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
long, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, hooked black claws,
visible only when not retracted. A orange, vertical nose sits below a pair of
clear indigo eyes with horizontal pupils.

Xavier the big silver soldier felo
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely wolf-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, spotted silver fur,
possessing a short, thin tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
long, thin legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, hooked black claws,
visible only when not retracted. A orange, vertical nose sits below a pair of
clear indigo eyes with horizontal pupils.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

Shule, I'm sitting on the couch in the Control Room of William Dove. I have
Magellan, Sassie on a leash and a hoverpallet following me. I put the aquariums
onto the hoverpallet. please put the bed on the hoverpallet as well. I'd prefer
not to take William Dove to old Earth and it be there for all that long but if
you forget and take us there, it's ok. If you have any extra felo chow bowls or
troughs, please bring them along with any fish food you have or felo chow. I
have put an extra bag of chow in Maria Mitchell who is in your ship and I did a
felo feeding from the Repair shop so your felo will be taken care of. Purr is
setup with 4 bags of chow plus the fish food it has in case an aquarium is left
behind. please take a look around in William Dove and pick up anything you see
that I might have overlooked. The last thing I need to do is pick up some food
to bring. please bring any that you have time to get. I should be back no later
than 2300 and can easily pickup food. I'm just planning for contingencies in
case I over sleep. Love you, - Lily

[Starship "Intrepid"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Centauri Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Though pockmarks still litter the surface of the landing pad, things appear to
be returning to normal. Most of the rusting hulks of ships have been cleared
away, with only rust-colored stains left on the pavement. The spaceport to the
north has been largely rebuilt, and stands shining white against the bright
azure Centauri sky. To the south you can see vast, overgrown fields of grass
stretching away behind blast barriers. Over the spaceport buildings the tallest
of Outland City's structures are visible.
The one-person fighter "I Am A New Pilot", the one-person flitter "Hi There!",
the two-person light transport "Return To Sender", the reconnaissance craft
"Artifactor", the one-person fighter "Hypernova", and the one-person runabout

I put keys for the two defensive fighters in a box on the shelf in the storage
room. I did not make keys for everyone. If we encounter trouble and need to use
the fighters, the best available pilots should grab a key from the box.

1. Use your head. A lot of trouble can be avoided if you just take a moment or
two to think things through.
2. Ask questions. There's no such thing as a stupid question on this ship. If
you aren't sure about something, ask someone.
3. Be respectful. Common courtesy and being polite can go a long way toward
keeping everything cordial. 
4. Don't be shy. It's important for a ship's crew to be able to trust each
other. Get to know your fellow crew.
5. Safety first. Double-check that all crew are aboard the ship after rift drive
repairs are completed.
6. Be tidy. Replace ship equipment when you're done with it. Loaner rift drive
repair tools, safety equipment, spare spacesuits, and all other gear should go
back where you found it when the task you needed it for is done.
7. Stay organized. The person who did the approach to a site of interest, or
someone they designate, takes the first space imager photo of that place. That
first photo goes in the appropriate box.
8. Be professional. The quantum entanglement communicator isn't a toy.

[Starship "We Strive To Live In Peace"; Control Room]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a cream wormhole drive tracer, a cream destination finder, a cream time
meter, a cream oriental rug with an intricate yellow flower pattern, a dark
yellow leather captain's chair, a reflective oval coffee table with a
transparent yellow plastic top and spindly chrome-plated legs, a small yellow
battery-operated fan, a shiny yellow trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured
couch with Jasmin the sleeping small red glowing felo on it, a black leather
sectional sofa, a modern white pod chair with a cream leather interior, a sleek
metal quantum entanglement communication device, a cream plastic box labeled
'Space Imager Photos', Zorya the hovering dragonfly robot, a Tardick lizard
named Isis, an elegant crystal decanter, a small blue insulated cooler, and
Buddy Smalls the little orange CatBot here.
Anfisa of Marzore is dozing on a modern white pod chair. Akemi Bando is sitting
on a dark yellow leather captain's chair. Blake Madison is sitting on a black
leather sectional sofa. Lillian Hudson, Lily Kaise, and Michael Winters are
sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch. Melinda Michaels, Kim Saunders,
and Liam O'Toole are standing here.
You can go southeast, southwest, and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with Jasmin the
sleeping small red glowing felo on it.)
"In fact, there are too many people in general," Liam says. "I just needed
Nissi."
Melinda giggles.
Michael says, "You'll live."
Lily smiles.
Michael grins.
Lillian smiles at Liam.
Blake says to Kim, "Where are the planets?"
Kim smiles at Blake. "Somewhere out there."
Blake nods.
'Somewhere over the rainbow
You say, "Somewhere over the rainbow."
Akemi says to Kim, "I'm not going to fuss too much, but there are three cabins
that do not have couples in them."
A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it flashes
past a viewport overhead.
Lillian Hudson activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive
detections and recent ping returns.
"Then it depends who they have in them." Kim gets a distant look on her face as
she ponders. "Melinda is right, the balance between single men and single women
is not even."
Melinda asks, "Is Simon still by himself?"
Blake says, "Wait."
Blake asks, "Why are we autotraveling?"
"I will now do a thing you shouldn't do," says Lillian, "but I know where we are
so I will do it."
Lily says to Blake, "Cause we can?"
Lillian Hudson activates the long-range scanner and sends an active sensor ping
into surrounding space.
Lily grins.
Lillian says, "Woohoo."
"Ping ping," says Blake.
Melinda says to Lillian, "Bad girl."
Lillian Hudson says into her metallic purple metachannel FTL communicator,
"Nobody is at The Bubble."
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.
Kim says to Blake, "To get to the bubble faster, from where we will take our
expedition heading."
Lillian says to Melinda, "Please, punish me."
Blake says, "Oh my."
Michael says, "Well then."
Blake Madison says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Lillian is
being punished."

for long, same for the pizza."
Melinda Michaels strolls southwest.
Nathaniel Owens helps himself to a slice of cake from a small blue insulated
cooler.
Morris says, "Yeah, same for these."
Akemi Bando navigates her metallic gray touch einrophone to a text-heavy
application and peers at the screen.
Blake Madison says into the PA microphone, "Are their toys under there or
something? Why's she under there?"
Michael Winters strides in from the southeast.
Michael Winters sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with Jasmin
the sleeping small red glowing felo on it.
Melinda Michaels strolls in from the southwest.
"Crap didn't realize I brought this with me," Morris says. "Be right back."
Morris Corlew lumbers southeast.
"As far as I know," says Michael Winters in a Candelaria accent, "simon isn't
rooming with anyone."
Melinda Michaels says to Akemi, "Has he got a room claimed?"
Michael Winters takes a sip of a cup of coffee.
"Let me double check," says Akemi.

Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "Mm not bad."
Nathaniel says to Akemi Bando, "Just a good thing that cesar wasn't pissed off,
or i'd have a lot more to deal with."
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
Blake asks, "Huh?"
Akemi Bando presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a

Lillian Hudson says into the PA microphone, "We're here, everybody out."

"That's why I ask," says Akemi, "better to check than end up with a weird
course."
Michael Winters strides in from the southeast.
Blake asks, "....so what's he having you do about that?"
Akemi Bando flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Kim nods.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
The ship has passed through an area filled with radio transmissions, the surface
of a bubble filled with gradually increasing transmissions which reach a
crescendo and then stop all at once. In the silent center of the bubble, bits of
wreckage are detected.

The starship has left a unique area of space.
Akemi says to Nathaniel, "You learned to take painkillers before going into a
bari pod."
Nathaniel says to Akemi, "Yep."
Lillian nods.
Nathaniel says to Akemi, "I leanred not to put the bomb as far in as possible,

Blake says, "But."
Blake asks, "He's making you do paperwork?"
Nathaniel says to Blake, "No, just got to fill in all the titles and stuff."
Blake says, "Wow."
Blake says, "What happened."
Nathaniel says to Blake, "And reupgrade all the ships."
"How did I end up with this again?" Kim considers a particularly useless tiny
metal cube thoughtfully.
Lillian beams at Kim.
Akemi says to Kim, "Lillian's slight of hand trick."
Blake says to Kim, "Blame lillian."
Lillian says, "It's always my fault."
Kim Saunders gives a particularly useless tiny metal cube to Lillian Hudson.
Michael Winters says in a Candelaria accent, "Its all Lillian's fault."
Lillian pouts at Kim.
Nathaniel says to Blake, "Bari pod exploded and I was still inside."
Lillian says to Kim, "But... it was a special gift, just for you."
Blake says to Nathaniel, "So what happened."
Melinda Michaels says to Lillian, "They do not understand your selfless acts of
kindness."
Morris says to Nathaniel, "Were you hurt?"
"Ouch!" exclaims Kim. "That's why I hate going into those all by myself."
Nathaniel says to Blake, "I was ejected into space and all my ships were gone."
Kim giggles.
Blake says to Nathaniel, "I'm guessing you lost the one fighter you brougth in."
Kim Saunders takes a bite of a slice of cake.
Lillian says to Melinda Michaels, "I am so misunderstood."

Kim says to Sakura, "Did you manage to get a living quarters?"
Sakura says to Kim, "Zandria and me have 8."
"We both did," says Zandria.
Blake says to Nathaniel, "...so when the pod exploded, the explosion took out
the beacon too?"
Kim nods. "Ok."
"Hang on," says Zandria.
Zandria Marschaund slides a "We Strive To Live In Peace" key onto a silvery blue
and misty silver tiger keychain.
Sakura says, "Peaches can you do a trick for these nice people."
Peaches the little white CatBot dances around in a happy circle.
Lillian Hudson forcefully hurls a particularly useless tiny metal cube at
Zandria Marschaund.
Zandria Marschaund deftly catches it.
Nathaniel says to Blake, "Didn't take out the beacon, but my ship was gone.
Don't ask me how, me and akemi were going over this earlier."

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
She is wearing a long-sleeved dark pink tee appliqued with small neon pink
dragonflies, a pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans with a small dark red 'XX'
embroidered on the left front pocket, and a pair of hot pink canvas sneakers.
She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and
a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise
Vineyards Pinot Grigio in her right hand.

some opinion. The way I remember the quests being phrased it was never hey I
need this and I'll give you this unique item. They've all been we're doing
research and we could use another of this item. This will help us with the
research and in return we'll share this tool with you instead of pulling money
out of our budget.

expert tools, so they could look at rolling in an entirely new thing where maybe
you work with an NPC technician to learn how to make them and then when you get
high enough points and find the tools at the GMG you go back and learn to make
better ones.

contrary positions, though. On the one hand, in the policy on scripting, it
specifically says that you're allowed to have soundpacks and even says that
triggers that are for accessibility are perfectly legitimate, then they don't
let people ask where to find a pack that comports with that policy. That's just
my personal opinion though."
