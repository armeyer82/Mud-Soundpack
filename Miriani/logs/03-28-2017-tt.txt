A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,

Notice from the Space Defense Captain: This is just a reminder to all alliance
pilots: remember to power down your starships, and to encourage your friends to
power down their starships as well! As most pilots know, starships on the
landing pad can increase the spread of Bari infestations if there's an
uninformed pilot who lands onto a planet while their ship is infested. So, do
your part and garage your ships, and tell your friends from the AEU and other
alliances to please do the same. [18:20 26 March 2317 GST]

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[New Earth; Spaceport East]
The scaffolding along the walls here is empty, the workers gone home for the
duration. Construction is nearly finished, but hardly anyone is here to enjoy
the fresh new look of the spaceport. All the shops lining the concourse are
closed at the moment, with only a few essential services remaining open. The
spaceport security office is to the northeast, the landing pad to the east, the
local Tesla branch is through an exit to the south. In addition, the spaceport's
Xenology Center is through a doorway to the southeast.

[New Earth; Central Stellar Cartography Branch]
Official-looking lettering declares this to be a branch of Central Stellar
Cartography, a galactic mapping organization recognized by all of the alliances.
One entire wall of the room is in fact the front of a massive computer which
extends into an adjacent room. Technicians constantly feed data into the
machine. In the center of the room, a holographic representation of the galaxy
is being projected. An extraordinarily tiny dot in one of the galaxy's spiral
arms is labeled simply "KNOWN SPACE."

[New Earth; Trading Center]
The trading center seems to be one of the busiest places in the spaceport. Which
is not surprising, considering the profits that successful trading can bring in.
Avoiding the automated computer terminals used by the career traders, you decide
to approach a human trade clerk. This, incidentally, will also subject your
purchases and sales to less scrutiny.
