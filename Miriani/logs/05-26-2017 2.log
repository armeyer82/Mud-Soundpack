00:11:34 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:11:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

00:12:58 [Starship "Firestorm"; Weapons Room]

00:12:58 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

00:14:01 [Starship "Firestorm"; Engineering Room]

00:14:01 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

00:16:24 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Or was it one of the stations?"

00:16:26 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But you guys do have a couple of powered up ships."

00:16:51 A big red soldier felo and a big red soldier felo efficiently break apart a bari hive.

00:16:53 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "In fact, every single ship on your landing pad is powered up. That's pretty much begging for an infestation."

00:16:57 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sadly, that's a habit we can't seem to break people of."

00:17:07 You pick up a big red soldier felo.

Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The Trucker rescue pod, the one-person cargo hauler "Salvager1", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

00:30:24 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:30:32 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "IFS at Orion, didn't get to count."

00:30:52 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:30:58 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Stand by."

00:31:04 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Will crew at Chetumal soon."

00:31:15 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Oh, nevermind we have enough for cruiser."

00:31:45 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Only two ships. Don't really need a cruiser."

00:31:55 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Ares-class."

00:34:00 Not much to see out there.

00:35:11 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Is it being taken care of or should we take off?"

00:35:24 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm handling it fine, but if you want to join, feel free."

00:35:40 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Oh, we won't intervene then."

00:38:37 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "EAOS looks clear."

00:39:28 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "League sectors clear. The pod was at Saturn and I took care of it."

00:39:51 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Is there anyone infested currently landed or in space?"

00:43:10 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Unclaimed look clear."

00:43:29 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Do we do Nutral as well?"

00:44:47 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Whose ship is Danger?"

00:44:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm not sure."

00:45:06 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Please don't leave your ships powered up on pads."

00:45:29 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yes, please that is a bad conbination. Leaving your ship powered..."

00:45:44 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I say that so much, but people dismiss it."

00:45:44 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "All looks clear now."

00:46:11 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Whose ship is Amimitl."

00:46:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's the cipactli, we're in it."

00:46:32 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Ok then."

00:48:12 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Orion is now clear."

00:48:23 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Thanks Ather."

00:48:35 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks Ather, appreciate it."

00:49:03 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Two lenses woo. That made it totally worth it."

00:49:27 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Did you solo it with the clipper again?"

00:49:31 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah."

00:49:42 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Clipper is more than capable of handling two ares."

00:49:56 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I don't know what of my ships would handle those."

00:50:01 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I hate to say it but maybe I should invest in a clipper..."

00:50:09 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "My avenger can do it."

00:50:22 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I should hope so. It has laser reflectors."

00:50:30 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "It's an energy hog, but it has twelve lasers... Or is that sixteen? I haven't been on a clipper n a while."

00:50:37 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "12."

00:50:44 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ah, ok then I was right."

00:51:05 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "You soloing it, Ather?"

00:51:16 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah."

00:51:22 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Nice."

00:51:32 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't like having crew on the clipper. If I do, I'd have them only as engineering."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
01:15:17 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

01:15:23     * Welcome to Star Conquest! *

01:15:23 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:15:28 There appear to be about 19 pilots recently active.

* Deniers of Grenwold Destruction Seize on Fringe Civilian Pilot's Statement that No Planets Have Ever Exploded [25 May 2317] (ISN)

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:01:57 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

02:02:13 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Ok, I think that was five. Yeah, pretty sure."

02:02:21 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Got me?"

02:02:28 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Yeah."

02:02:32 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Where are we meeting?"

02:02:41 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Earth."

02:02:49 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:02:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:02:52 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:02:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

02:02:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:02:59 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Hello there, League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-97! Welcome to home space!"

02:03:01 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-61" has jumped into the sector.

02:03:01 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Hexidus" has jumped into the sector.

02:03:04 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Hello there, League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-61! Welcome to home space!"

02:03:04 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-97" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

02:03:06 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-97" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

02:03:07 The ship is already moving.

02:03:07 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-97" has landed on the planet Old Earth.

02:03:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:03:10 "old earthland" does not match any known sector.

02:03:10 The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-61" has landed on the planet Old Earth.

02:03:18 Would you like to request landing clearance at Old Earth?

02:03:18 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:03:19 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:03:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:03:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:03:31 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

02:03:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:03:35 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:03:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:03:36 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

02:03:36 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:03:37 You exit the ship.

02:03:37 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The Trucker rescue pod, the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-97", the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-61", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

02:03:39 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

02:03:39 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Sawyer Reid is sleeping on a comfortable wooden chair.
You can go out.

02:04:07 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:04:35 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hexidus you have damage."

02:04:39 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the vostok-class capsule "Anka".

02:05:29 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

02:05:29 Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people. The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a salt lick, and a sanitation drone here.

02:11:27 Roxanne Alvarez (asleep)

02:11:27 She appears to be 21 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has tan skin. Her body is full-figured with attractively curved hips and attractive calves. She has average-sized shoulders and large breasts. Her face is heart-shaped and girlish, with a delicate nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of plucked eyebrows, her eyes are blue-grey and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, curly hair is light ash brown and hanging in a single braid. She has neatly trimmed pale fingernails. She has a small mole on her chin.
 She is wearing a standard grey shipsuit and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a barely functional metachannel FTL communicator, and a small cloth sack. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

02:11:29 Nathaniel Owens says, "Sorry."

02:12:32 Nathaniel Owens asks, "I just need a few, that ok?"

02:19:29 [Starship "Libertarians Defense Raptor Alpha"; Weapons Room Three]

02:19:29 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.

03:14:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:14:16 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:14:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:14:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:14:25 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:14:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:14:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:14:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:14:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:14:48 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:14:53 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:14:56 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:14:58 Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "Glad you're here in case I loose connection."

03:14:59 The computer reports that the three-person cannoneer "EAOS Ion Rider Lambda" has jumped out of the sector.

03:15:02 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:15:02 You say to Lily, "I feed asteria."

03:15:10 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Delta).

03:15:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:15:19 You say, OOCly, "No problem."

03:15:38 Lily Kaise says, "Going to see if I can get an upgrade I heard about."

03:15:45 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 802" has jumped into the sector.

03:15:49 You say, "Ah, ok."

03:15:50 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 802! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:16:02 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 802" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

03:16:06 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 417" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:16:07 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 802" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

03:16:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:16:09 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:16:10 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 802" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:16:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:16:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:16:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:16:29 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:16:37 Lily Kaise says, "Need to remain powered up. Will be right back."

03:16:41 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:16:41 You nod.

03:16:43 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:20:55 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:20:57 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:21:01 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:21:07 You say to Lily Kaise, "Did you want to go on beacons?"

03:21:10 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:22:10 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:22:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:22:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:22:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:23:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:23:05 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Jump sequence aborted."
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Providence Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:23:09 Via general sector communication, Providence Station transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

03:23:10 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:23:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Glittering Belt. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:23:11 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

03:23:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:23:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:23:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:23:18 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Glittering Belt."

03:23:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:23:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:23:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:23:22 This asteroid belt is unusually close to its star, and the slowly rotating asteroids glitter brightly in the sunlight.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Space Station Delta in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:23:25 Via general sector communication, Space Station Delta transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

03:23:29 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:23:31 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid Belt Management Station.

03:23:34 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:23:39 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:24:07 Lily Kaise grins.

03:24:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:24:11 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

03:24:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

03:24:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:24:27 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:24:29 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:24:31 You scramble to your feet.

03:24:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:24:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:24:58 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact white refrigerator, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

03:25:10 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:25:12 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

03:25:17 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:25:17 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:25:22 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:25:26 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Gonzales You coming?"

03:25:31 Lily Kaise says to you, "Is old frontier open?"

03:25:32 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "He is."

03:25:35 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:25:39 You say, "It is."

03:25:41 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "How many do we have then."

03:25:41 [General Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Yessir."

03:25:46 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "7. Need one more."

03:25:53 Lily Kaise says, "Darn."

03:25:55 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "One for cruisers!"

03:26:02 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Though 7 is still good."

03:26:10 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

03:26:10 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well there's two of us so we'll pass."

03:26:12 You say, "Old Frontier is open."

03:26:16 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:26:35 Lily Kaise says, "But if you wanted to go it's ok Love."

03:26:38 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:26:43 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

03:26:44 You say, "Nah, I just did some beacons."

03:26:48 A launch trajectory is located.

03:26:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:26:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:27:02 You say, "A couple of them."

03:27:02 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:27:02 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:27:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:27:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:27:06 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Cool!"

03:27:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:27:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:27:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:27:14 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:27:17 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

03:27:21 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:27:23 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:27:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:27:36 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "The lucky caller of johann, you win a free weapons room spot!"

03:28:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Make Johann double."

03:28:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:28:12 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:28:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:28:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:28:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:28:32 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:28:49 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Last call."

03:28:58 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Need 1 person for cruiser beacons."

03:29:09 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Cadet's welcome."

03:29:22 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Anyone who can gun."

03:29:34 You're not wearing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

03:29:40 You give a Tardick lizard named Asteria to Lily Kaise.

03:29:46 You say to Lily, "I fed her already."

03:29:54 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Alko?"

03:29:57 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

03:30:07 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Evangeline."

03:30:18 You peer out...

03:30:18 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

03:30:21 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:30:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:30:53 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:31:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:33:02 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Woo deactivated projectile."

03:33:11 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "You suck."

03:33:19 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "78125000 credits."

03:33:20 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "How?"

03:33:24 [General Communication] Ali Candan cries.

03:33:49 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I got an activated projectile weapon."

03:33:56 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Um, deactivated, I should say."

03:33:56 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

03:34:11 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "It can't be that bad."

03:35:38 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:35:42 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

03:35:49 You grin. "I fed her for you already."

03:36:06 Lily says to a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Hey I missed you but not as much as I miss Shule."

03:36:10 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:38:43 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:38:46 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:41:57 A semi-transparent egg wiggles for a moment, then a large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior emerges!

03:47:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:51:22 Lily Kaise runs a small silver genetic tester slowly over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks as the device blinks a light and beeps softly.

03:51:22 Lily Kaise studies a small screen on the device.

03:51:32 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:51:32 Lily Kaise opens a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

03:51:47 Lily Kaise removes a semi-transparent egg from a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

03:52:00 Lily Kaise gives you a semi-transparent egg.

03:52:05 Lily Kaise says, "It's an orange one."

03:52:07 You say, "Oh, thanks."

03:52:09 Lily Kaise closes a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

03:52:09 You grin.

03:52:14 Lily Kaise grins.

03:52:17 You open an efficient round egg storage container for a moment.

03:52:18 You remove an efficient round egg storage container from a leather briefcase for a moment.
You put a semi-transparent egg in an efficient round egg storage container.

03:52:31 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:52:38 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:52:48 You say to Lily, "I so missed you my love."

03:56:44 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

03:56:58 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

03:57:35 Lily Kaise returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

03:57:43 Lily Kaise says, "Stupid Fringe."

03:57:47 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

03:57:49 You say, "Yeah."

03:58:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:58:10 Lily Kaise says, "What else would one expect from those who typically get nothing more than a middle school education."

03:58:17 You nod.

03:59:29 Lily Kaise says, "I'm disappointed about the Explorer Corps but nobody was ever invited and i've told you before, I couldn't take it seriously. It's a shame though as we shouldn't have to continue to rely upon other's tech for the main ship."

04:00:13 Lily Kaise says, "Makes us continue to be the joke of Explortion amongst alliances."

04:00:16 You nod. "Yeah, the new AEU pilots had a lot of questions regarding it and were pretty disappointed too."

04:00:18 Lily Kaise says, "Ecploration."

04:00:22 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:00:29 Lily Kaise says, "Wow I can't talk let's try exploration."

04:00:41 You grin at Lily Kaise. "I understood."

04:00:45 Lily Kaise says, "I'm sure they did."

04:01:04 You say, "They were rather surprised that Ather never even made it in either."

04:02:39 Lily Kaise says, "First, I thought perhaps Ather would be invited since he earned a Bolt. Then I was the one who the old monk at Xii He approached with the location of the Floating Buddha but nooo they claimed it had to be a subsequent discovery and what have pilots found lately of note? Absolutely nothing."

04:02:51 You nod. "I know."

04:02:52 Lily Kaise says, "Oops Xia He."

04:02:57 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:04:08 Lily Kaise says, "Even when they annnounced it, I scoffed and laughed at it as I knew it was a joke ton us and obviously everybody else made snide remarks about the Explorer's Corps."

04:04:18 You nod.

04:04:44 Lily Kaise says, "Oh well but I'm going over to check something."

04:04:46 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:04:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:04:48 You say, "Ok."

04:04:49 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:04:52 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:04:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:04:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:04:55 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:05:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:05:05 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:05:05 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Aenea Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:05:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

04:05:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:05:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:05:12 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

04:05:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:05:13 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:05:13 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Aenea Orbit."

04:05:20 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

04:05:21 Via general sector communication, Aenea transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

04:05:29 Lily Kaise removes spacesuit components from a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side and quickly dons them.

04:05:29 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:05:30 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Aenea.

04:05:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:05:52 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "I'm sure the Magnotor is gone but I have to verify it for myself."

04:05:52 Lily Kaise says, "I'm sure the Magnotor is gone but I have to verify it for myself."

04:05:57 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

04:05:57 [Enter `yes' or `no']

04:05:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:05:58 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.
You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

04:05:59 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:06:01 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:06:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

04:06:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:06:04 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:06:04 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

04:06:07 Lily Kaise glides in.

04:06:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:06:19 Lily Kaise presses a large button marked CYCLE.

04:06:20 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

04:06:25 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

04:06:30 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

04:06:31 You exit the ship.

04:06:52 Lily Kaise says, "Heh."

04:07:03 You say, "Wow."

04:07:05 Lily Kaise says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

04:07:14 Lily Kaise glides southeast.

04:07:20 [Aenea; Space Research Center]

04:07:20 You can go south, northwest, and up.
[Aenea; Spaceport Landing Pad]

04:07:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:07:21 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:07:26 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

04:07:26 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.
Lily Kaise just boarded the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:07:29 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

04:07:32 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

04:07:34 Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.

04:07:34 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

04:07:39 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

04:07:41 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

04:07:41 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

04:07:43 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

04:07:43 [Enter `yes' or `no']

04:07:43 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

04:07:45 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

04:07:45 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small white trash bin, a clear plastic food storage container, a compact white refrigerator, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

04:07:47 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:07:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:07:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:07:54 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:07:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:08:02 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:08:02 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:08:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:08:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:08:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:08:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:08:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:08:09 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:08:10 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:08:10 You stroke a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

04:08:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:08:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:08:13 Lily Kaise suddenly bashes her spacesuit helmet into your face.

04:08:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:08:14 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:08:17 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

04:08:24 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:08:25 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:08:26 You chuckle. "Ouch."

04:08:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:08:30 You put a gentle kiss on Lily Kaise's space suit helmet.

04:08:31 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Lily Kaise say, "Oops1."

04:08:31 Lily Kaise says, "Oops1."

04:08:39 Lily Kaise removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

04:08:40 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:08:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:08:42 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:08:42 You laugh.

04:08:45 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:08:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:08:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:08:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:09:00 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:09:00 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:09:03 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:09:10 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:09:11 Lily Kaise says, "Ok I need to go check the range office."

04:09:14 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

04:09:14 Lily Kaise glides out.

04:09:16 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:14:41 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:14:55 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:15:31 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the neck.

04:15:34 Lily Kaise says, "Glad I checked. The Asteroid processor in 285 will go offline sometime tomorrow morning."

04:15:40 You say, "Ah, ok."

04:15:49 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:16:28 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow you have been busy! We have 2091 Combat!"

04:16:32 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:16:34 You grin.

04:16:35 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:16:36 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:16:41 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:17:26 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:17:32 You say, "I certainly try to stay busy."

04:18:00 Lily Kaise beams at you.

04:18:05 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:18:11 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh well at least you are making up for my not being busy!"

04:18:14 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:18:17 You laugh.

04:18:54 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Pirate transport in orion if anyone wants to tangle."

04:18:58 You say to Lily, "I still missed seeing you at work dearly the last couple of nights."

04:19:22 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I sure wish I could have gotten back but just oculdn't."

04:19:27 Lily Kaise says, "Couldn't."

04:19:27 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:19:33 You say to Lily, "I undrstand."

04:19:50 Lily Kaise says, "I missed you Love."

04:19:57 You say to Lily, "Sahll we go dance with the pirates?"

04:20:03 Lily Kaise says, "Sure."

04:20:05 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:20:07 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:20:08 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

04:20:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:20:21 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

04:20:22 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:20:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Striking Distance, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:20:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:20:36 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:20:37 The ship is already moving.

04:20:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:20:38 Lily Kaise glides up.

04:20:39 Which sector did you mean?

04:20:39 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)

04:20:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:20:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:20:48 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

04:20:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:20:58 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:20:59 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

04:40:10 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Another transport in Orion shule and Lily, since you missed the other one."

04:40:21 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Or not."

04:40:41 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Did it jump out again?"

04:40:48 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It did."

04:41:14 "Are the pirates listening to the tactical channel?" You frown.

04:41:19 You say, "I hope not."

04:41:46 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent". The organization has earned 1,702,239.54 credits.

04:41:48 Lily Kaise says, "Dang! Those transports are getting too smart for scavengers."

04:42:12 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Pirates need debris too."

04:42:39 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I have twelve bubble... thirteen now. wow."

04:42:41 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:43:51 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the eight-person prime defense mark two "It's A Wolf Thing".

04:44:41 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:44:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:44:45 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:44:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:44:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:45:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:45:03 Lily Kaise grins.

04:45:06 You ask, "Where are we going?"

04:45:22 Lily chudkles as she considers the display from library.

04:45:29 Lily Kaise says, "I was just curious."

04:45:32 Lily Kaise presses some buttons on the navigation board.

04:45:33 This is a sector within a FTL beacon network.

04:45:35 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:45:37 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:45:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:45:42 You grin.

04:45:45 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:45:45 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:45:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:45:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:45:53 Lily Kaise says, "I do want to poke around though."

04:46:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:46:03 You exclaim, "Totally, that'd be fun!"

04:46:04 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:46:04 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:46:06 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:46:06 Lily Kaise grins.

04:46:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:46:12 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Not this morning though!"

04:46:15 You nod.

04:46:21 You say, "Yeah, getting a bit late for you."

04:46:32 Lily Kaise yawns. "Yeah unfortunately."

04:46:35 Lily Kaise sighs.

04:46:45 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:46:52 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:46:55 You say to Lily, "At least we got to spend some time together."

04:47:07 Lily Kaise says, "I'm so glad we did."

04:47:13 You beam at Lily Kaise.

04:47:29 Lily Kaise says, "I was just worried you might not be at work yourself or had given up on me."

04:47:45 You say, "NAh, I'll never give up on you."

04:47:52 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:47:52 You say, "I love you too much."

04:47:57 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:48:02 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

04:48:42 Lily says to you, "I love you so much too. Still, sometimes lately I don't feel as though I can do enough for you or be available for you as much as I wish I could."

04:48:58 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "QE message transfer to Oracle complete."

04:49:14 "You're fine." You smile at Lily Kaise. "I understand. I just am thankful for every moment we get to spend with one another."

04:49:21 Lily Kaise beams at you.

04:49:28 Lily Kaise says, "Me too Love."

04:49:41 Shule smiles and kisses you passionately.

04:49:55 Lily kisses you passionately in return.

04:50:04 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:50:11 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:50:15 You ask, "Let's go lie down?"

04:50:24 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah probably a good idea."

04:50:28 You grin.

04:50:44 Lily says to you, "Oh and thank you so much for feeding and entertaining Miss Asteria."

04:50:49 Lily Kaise smiles.

04:50:51 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

04:50:53 You smile at Lily Kaise. "No problem."

04:50:56 Lily Kaise glides south.

04:50:58 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

You can go out.

04:51:06 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

04:51:06 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

04:58:51 Lily Kaise smiles.

04:58:53 You exclaim, "It sure is!"

04:58:58 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I guess a horny box could be worth quite a bit to the right person."

04:59:23 Lily Kaise says, "Hopefully by the end of Aust, we'll be up to 1000 and then we can get the next Scoop."

04:59:28 Lily Kaise says, "August."

04:59:30 You exclaim, "Woo!"

04:59:31 You grin.

05:10:47 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Rejoice! Akemi has retired from the fleet."

05:11:11 You blink.

05:11:23 Shule looks shocked.

05:11:35 I can't find someone with the name 'akemi'.

05:12:46 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Nobody cares? Great."

05:13:06 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm just... so surprised and shocked. I'm speechless."

05:13:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

05:13:11 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Wait what?"

05:13:39 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I've been told when you don't have anything nice to say, that you shouldn't say anything. So with that..."

05:13:40 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Sorry what happened, I am just a lowly cadet doing some exploring."

05:13:44 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Akemi retired. All this shit was for nothing."

05:13:56 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Are you fucking serious? God damn it."

05:14:22 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "We live in trying times."

05:14:27 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Haha, that's more like it. Yes, DAMN IT, she retired."

05:14:38 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Not true. If she hadn't gotten caught she probably would not have retired."

05:14:43 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yes, but you don't know what mutuality did for her."

05:15:09 [General Communication] Evangeline takes a breath. "Fuck a duck. Why? i do not understand it."

05:15:15 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "We gave her a home and she kicked us in the TEETH."

05:15:40 [General Communication] Josh Preston transmits, "Oh, dear. I do not relish the idea of fucking a duck, nor getting it stuck while attempting such a feat."

05:15:43 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yes, exactly! That is what I mean! That is unfair to you!"

05:15:54 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "So unfair!"

05:16:20 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Yes, dammit!"

05:16:22 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Well, are you really surprised? She screwed the League, why wouldnt' she screw you guys? And that just gave me a really bad mental picture."

05:16:31 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Oh god johann."

05:16:41 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "That is dusgusting, never do that, again."

05:18:21 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You know what she told me? Trying is binary. You try or you don't. She didn't. Thanks, Akemi. THANK YOU."

05:18:31 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I told people, two years ago, more than that now, that Akemi was, and would be, nothing but trouble. I was right, and we're better off without her. So good riddance."

05:19:05 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "If you stick your neck out for people, at least they could NOT stomp you."

05:19:50 Lily says to you, "Nite Love Rest well. Sweet dreams and remember I will always love you."

05:19:54 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "She stomped us on the neck, is what she did."

05:20:11 You say to Lily, "I will always love you too. Good night and rest well."

05:20:22 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You let her. Should've listened to me, way back then."

05:20:36 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Mutuality."

05:20:37 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Ungrateful cow. You did what you could for her and would you look at that. Honestly? Things might be easier for both the league and mutuality now."

05:20:45 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I don't remember this, but the next time you say something way back when, I will listen for sure."

05:20:47 Lily Kaise says, "What."

05:20:52 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

05:21:07 Lily Kaise returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

05:21:09 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:21:20 Lily Kaise says, "Make that bitch pay for her own mistakes."

05:21:27 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "That damn Billiam I swear."

05:21:51 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:21:56 You say to Lily, "Night my love."

05:22:01 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "Billiam is loose cannon that will be doom of us all."

05:23:04 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the north.

05:23:05 Lily says to you, "Nite Hun."

05:23:09 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Xavier the old big silver soldier felo.

05:23:10 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

05:23:31 You stroke the soft fur of Xavier the old big silver soldier felo.

05:24:28 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm sorry Cherri."

05:25:19 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Thanks, we know who our real friends are."

05:25:56 [General Communication] Evangeline doesn't say anything for a long moment, where the sound of the ship is the only thing heard, then, "Yes,"

05:26:07 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I'm sorry for the Mutuality, I'm happy for me. I respected her for a long time despite the fact we disagreed on some things, then to find out it was not returned and whatnot was a real kick in the teeth."

05:26:25 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "If only she was still around, we could have an airlock party."

05:26:32 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire laughs.

05:26:40 You blink heavily and then doze off.

05:26:41 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "That is not funy, but I mean, all the same."

05:27:13 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

05:35:05 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches out.

05:39:05 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches in from the north.

05:43:05 Xavier the old big silver soldier felo marches out.

05:52:15 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.

05:52:15 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

05:54:02 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the three-person flying wing "Destruction Imminent".

06:17:16 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I have no one I'm exploring with."

06:17:42 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I have... well I am a loaner most of the time."

06:19:02 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Well one never knows what you will find out there, even if there's no points or credits coming from it, but a satisfaction and discovery!"

06:19:24 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Mmm."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Sorry for the delayed response. I had intended to meet up with you earlier this morning, but didn't get a chance to. Yes, I am super excited about this apartment. I also can't wait to make your dream come true in Critical Strike. I keep fantasising about that. Mmmmm, you would look so sexy bent over the main control board. Anyways, I hope we can meet up soon. I did want to let you know that I will not be at work much from the 31st of this month through June 6th or so.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly wi
10:29:31 th his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on 17 April 2317 GST. Time remaining: 2 days, 15 hours, 32 minutes, and 8 seconds

I wanted to offer my condolences and express my deep disappointment in Akemi's retirement. For a number of months I was not able to come to work, but I had heard that the Mutuality had welcomed Akemi among their ranks. IF memory serves me right, it was not very long ago. How incredibly unfair, selfish, and heartless of her to abandon people who had worked so hard to accept her as one of theirs. I'm deeply saddened by her actions. I wish the Mutuality prosperity and happiness despite the Akemi's betrayal. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. Fly safe.

10:39:59  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of slim black linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

10:39:59 You are carrying nothing.

10:40:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

10:40:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

10:57:57 You peer south...

10:57:58 
[Starship "Firestorm"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a large leather chair, an improved temporary wormhole drive, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and down.

12:56:45 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:56:45 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

18:04:30 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:04:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

18:16:18 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

18:16:19 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:16:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:16:20 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:16:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:16:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:16:35 The ship is already moving.

18:16:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:16:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:16:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:16:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

18:16:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:16:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:16:43 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

18:16:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:16:44 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:17:05 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

18:17:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:17:11 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Salvager1" has jumped into the sector.

18:17:12 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'll drop, take a gunship."

18:17:14 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Hello, Salvager1! Welcome to Fringe space! Make yourself at home!"

18:17:26 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Bessy" has jumped into the sector.

18:17:27 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Thanks ted, sorry."

18:17:30 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Hello, Bessy! Welcome to Fringe space! Make yourself at home!"

18:17:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:17:32 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

18:17:36 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "No worries."

18:17:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

18:17:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:17:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:17:51 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:17:52 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:17:52 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:17:52  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of slim black linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

18:17:53 You are carrying nothing.

[Starship "Cleopatra"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad.
You can go south and down.

18:21:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:21:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:21:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:21:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:22:44 Hi Shule and Lily,
The charge station at 777 is going to go down in about 8 hours. I did buy the other charge module as you wished, but I'll need another transmitter for the station.
This one will obviously last longer, but thanks for letting me use that charger to get rid of it.
If you could put this one on the main ship, and not the spare parts, I'd appreciate it.
Thanks loads,
Eve.
