16:28 Emily Sanders
She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This 26 year old woman stands 5 feet and 4 inches tall and is slender with a medium bust size. She has a fair complexion. She is wearing several braded strings of light blue glass beads in her shoulder-length, strawberry blonde hair, which is plaited into numerous micro braids with multi-colored beads and shimmering gold and silver bells strung onto them. She has almond-shaped brown eyes with an upturned nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an Aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a pink and blue haze filled with pink and blue fluttering butterflies.
She has a tattoo of a blue fairy on her torso, a tattoo of a blue butterfly on her back, a tattoo of a hot pink heart with angel wings on her right forearm, and a tattoo of a hot pink wolf on her left forearm.
The nails on her left hand are painted pink with multi-colored Fireflies and adorned with rhinestones and the nails on her right hand are painted pink and blue with burgundy Swarovski crystals shaped into dragonflies and adorned with flecks of gold.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is wearing an eye-catching cherry blossom pink diamond belly chain adorned with tiny dangling blue glass butterflies around her waist. She is also wearing a pink rolled toolkit, a pulse emitter clip, a message board reader, a small pink camera, a pink stun armor storage bag, a pink handheld planetary surveyor, a level seven archaeological dig site scanner, a pink padded leather velvet-lined guitar case, a glittering pink leather canvas carrier, a pink weapon detector, a pink armor storage bag, a sparkly pink and blue velvet diaper bag patterned with kittens, a blue flight control scanner, a glowing yellow communicator with shiny cyan controls, a hot pink metafrequency lapel pin, a cute tiger striped cat backpack, a pink silk purse with a holographic image of a snowstorm on the front, a pink archaeological artifact storage container, a diamond-studded gold digital watch with a butterfly-shaped liquid crystal face, a butterfly charm bracelet, a compact pink leopard print Lore computer, a pink spacesuit storage bag, a blue silk purse with a holographic image of a snowstorm on the front, a pink spacesuit jet, an asteroid hauling kit, a pink spacesuit navigational computer, a shimmering rose gold ring set with a tiny color-changing rose, a diamond-studded silver ring with an intricate pair of wings carved into the band, a delicate crystal ring set with several tiny multi-colored lights, a gold chain with a dragon pendant, and a silver chain with a vine-draped cross pendant.
She is carrying nothing.

You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.
