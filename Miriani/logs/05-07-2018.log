["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a smiling nanny, a pine cradle with green fleece blankets patterned with strawberries, and a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars here.

Trading
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Trading is the movement of goods from one trading post to another. The goal is to buy goods at low prices and sell them elsewhere at high prices. Of course, you also have to factor supply, demand, and a little common sense in the equation. 
  Examining the Menu:
When you enter a trading center, you can type MENU to display a list of commodities for sale and in demand. An example menu might look like this:
        --- Empanda Station; Trading Center ---
Item                          Demand         Buying For
----------------------------------------------------------
Electromagnets                90000.0        550.0
Radiation Capacitor           125000.0       350.0
Aluminum Wires                190000.0       200.0
Unobtanium Enclosures         110000.0       600.0
Unrefined Cardenium           105000.0       975.0
Nickle                        1150000.0      60.0
Gold                          375000.0       200.0
Copper                        1250000.0      50.0
Diamonds                      60000.0        400.0
Item                          Supply         Selling For
----------------------------------------------------------
Relativity Drive              --             --
Xenon                         980001.0       50.0
Hydrogen                      490001.0       55.0
Grain                         500001.0       30.0
Carbon
01:18                         600001.0       30.0
Droid Components              180000.0       200.0
The first section shows what the trading center is buying. Take Gold, for example. Empanda is in need of 375,000 units of gold and is willing to pay 200 credits per unit for it.
The second section shows what the trading center has for sale. We can see that they have 980,001 units of Xenon and are selling it for a mere 50 credits per unit.
When an item has a double dash (--) in a field, it means that the trading center has none of that item available. More information about this occurance can be found in the Tiers section below.
If an item has an asterisk (*) in front of it, that means that the commodity is constructed from a combination of other commodities. You can see which these are by typing INFO <commodity name>.
  Tiers:
Trading commodities operate on a system of tiers. That is to say, the more complex an item is, the more parts it requires to construct that item. There are basic commodities used in the production of others, such as aluminum, bardenium, electronics, etc. But other things, such as droid components, require a combination of parts to construct.
When a trading center lacks the materials to construct more advanced goods, they sell out. When this happens, the demand for the goods necessary to build more advanced components will go up. When enough of the raw materials are available, the trading center will construct the more advanced component which, in turn, might go toward constructing an even more advanced component or be available for trade to other trading centers that may require it.
You can see what materials are required to build a certain component by typing INFO <commodity> in any trading center. Depending on your options, this will either present you with a tree or a list of every component required to build the commodity in question and every component required to build those components all the way down the line until there is nothing left to build.
  Production of Goods:
One thing a player will want to keep in mind is that a space station cannot support itself. It will always require certain supplies to be delivered to it in order to function. Things such as water and oxygen must come through trading centers. Thus it is always wise to keep in mind that a space station will almost always be looking for these goods. It's also logical to assume that a desert planet would be looking for water and military planets are looking for materials necessary to construct weapons and military devices. Or they are looking for already constructed weapons and military devices.
  Buying:
After you have located a suitable trading route, you simply type the command BUY into a trading center. You will then be prompted to choose what ship to load the cargo into and how many units of the cargo you wish to buy.
  Selling:
To sell yo
01:18 ur cargo, simply type SELL into the trading center. It will prompt you for what you wish to sell.
  Getting Rid of Cargo:
Should you decide that your cargo is worthless, you can type EXPEL from the control room of your ship to get rid of it. This is almost certainly not what you wish to do after purchasing the cargo, but nonetheless is an option available as a last resort.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage] (indoors)
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

01:21 You make a selection on a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

01:21 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]
Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kitty" reports current location pinpointed at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon.

01:21 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:21 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

01:21 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:21 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

01:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:21 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two starships and two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:21 The ten-person battlecruiser "Animallity" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

01:21 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

01:21 Select a ship:

01:21 [1] the ten-person battlecruiser "Storm of Torment"
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:21 The computer reports the ten-person battlecruiser "Storm of Torment" is one unit away from this ship.

01:21 Invalid selection.

01:21 The ship is already moving.

01:21 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:21 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:21 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

01:21 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.
Storm of Torment has a lock on this starship.

01:21 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:21 [General Communication] Quintavious Thomas transmits, "Beta."

01:21 Via general sector communication, Storm of Torment transmits: "quack"

01:21 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

01:21 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:21 The ship must be in space to do that.

01:21 The ship must be in space to do that.

01:21 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

01:21 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:21 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

01:21 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:21 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:21 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:22 #$#soundpack_pong

01:22 #$#soundpack_lag 109

01:22 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:22 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:22 Your communicator confirms a private link with Aaron Blade.

01:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

01:22 [Private | Aaron Blade] You transmit, "Hey"

01:22 The ship is already on that status level.

01:22 [Private | Aaron Blade] Aaron Blade transmits, "how goes"

01:22 You press a large green button.
The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from red to green.
You hear the gentle hum begin to fade as the weapons power down.

01:22 [Private | Aaron Blade] You transmit, "Not bad. You?"

01:22 [Private | Aaron Blade] Aaron Blade transmits, "just chillin. bored"

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the five-person transverser "Blue Star", the five-person transverser "Ikezuki", and the three-person freighter "Mind Over Matter" landed here.

01:43 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:43 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:43 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:43 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:43 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

01:43 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

12:48 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

12:48 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

12:48 The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."

12:48 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:48 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:48 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

12:48 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

12:48 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:48 You remove Ashley Valleris from a softly padded black snuggly.

12:48 You put Ashley Valleris in a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars.

12:48 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:48 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:48 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:48 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

12:48 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:48 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

12:48 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:48 There are no ships here.

12:48 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:48 The starship is already moving.

12:48 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:48 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

12:48 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:48 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?
[1] High Guard Command
[2] Moon Surface
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:48 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

12:49 #$#soundpack_pong

12:49 #$#soundpack_lag 110

12:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

12:49 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

12:49 You put a droid remote titled "rolukssica" in a sleek black leather carrying case.

12:49 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:49 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, a smiling nanny, a pine cradle with green fleece blankets patterned with strawberries, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, and a translucent architect

22:17 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

22:17 You're already sitting down.

22:17 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:17 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:17 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:17 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:17 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:17 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:17 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:17 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 4, 6."

22:17 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:17 There are no ships here.

22:17 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:17 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:17 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:17 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

22:18 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

22:18 You stand up.

22:18 For a top, you are wearing a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of camouflage jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heart-shaped engraved locket on a gold chain, a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, an antique gold wedding band engraved with intertwining hearts, a wide titanium ring with "forever" engraved on it, a palladium signet ring with a diamond in the shape of a leaping dolphin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek blue metal dolphin keychain, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, a red spacesuit navigational computer, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a softly padded black snuggly, a soft white cloth diaper bag patterned with dolphins, a red archaeological artifact storage container, a level five archaeological dig site scanner, and a black stun armor storage bag.

22:18 You are carrying nothing.

22:18 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

22:18 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

22:18 You remove a pair of gray sneakers with red laces.

22:18 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

22:18 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

22:18 You can't pick that up.

22:18 A bulky stun armor battery pack may not be fully charged. Unload it anyway? [Enter "yes" or "no"]

22:19 [Miriani; Landing Area]
The reinforced steel of this massive landing site gleams in the multitude of lights glittering from the massive spaceport tower to the north. The curved structure spears up towards the sky, its exterior marked and colored with a vast array of murals and messages. Its many windows glow with blazing light, and enormous colored spotlights cast their beams down from the very top of the tower. A sculpted granite archway leads into the spaceport, and above it is a gold embossed plaque with engraved letters which read, Miriani Spirit tower. A lighted sign directing pilots to the spaceport garage is visible off to the left above a set of gleaming metal stairs which lead downward. In the far distance, at the gated edge of the landing site, there appears to be a small brick structure with several people gathered around it.

The reinforced steel of this massive landing site gleams in the multitude of lights glittering from the massive spaceport tower to the north. The curved structure spears up towards the sky, its exterior marked and colored with a vast array of murals and messages. Its many windows glow with blazing light, and enormous colored spotlights cast their beams down from the very top of the tower. A sculpted granite archway leads into the spaceport, and above it is a gold embossed plaque with engraved letters which read, Miriani Spirit tower. A lighted sign directing pilots to the spaceport garage is visible off to the left above a set of gleaming metal stairs which lead downward. In the far distance, at the gated edge of the landing site, there appears to be a small brick structure with several people gathered around it.
