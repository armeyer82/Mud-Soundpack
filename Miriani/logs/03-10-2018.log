["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

22:00 ["Seventh Zin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You can go northwest, northeast, and out.

22:00 You hear a satisfying click as the ship's docking ring is retracted from the docked ship's hull.

22:00 The computer announces, "Undocking complete."

22:00 Would you like to request entry into the five-person transverser "Starlight Express"'s docking bay? If you say no, your ship will dock normally using the docking ring. [Enter "yes" or "no"]

22:00 You request entry into "Starlight Express"'s docking bay.

22:00 The computer announces, ""Starlight Express" has accepted the docking request. Negotiating with remote computer to establish docking parameters."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship begins to enter another ship's docking bay.

22:00 The faint vibration eases off as the starship sets down inside the other ship's docking bay.

22:00 The computer announces, "Docking complete."

22:00 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

22:00 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a shiny silver starship simul

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

Starship Weapons
--------------------------------------------------
  Laser Turrets
Laser turrets are small turrets mounted on the hull that focus energy into an amplified beam of light in order to cause damage to a target. 
Pros:
Can fire without confirming a target.
Usually abundant on most ships.
Cons:
Begin to lose effectiveness the more they are damaged.
Require a fair amount of starship charge to fire.
Can be reflected back at you if the target has laser reflectors.
  Bardenium Cannons
Bardenium Cannons are small launchers along the starship's hull that, when activated, fire a chunk of charged bardenium at a target. The damage done by bardenium cannons is dependant on the type of bardenium being fired as well as the physical mechanism required to launch the bardenium.
Pros:
50% chance of doing hull damage.
Require less power to fire.
Aren't reduced in capacity by damage.
Cons:
Require reloading with ammunition.
Pro/Con:
Require confirming a target before they fire.
  Computer Disruption Pulse
The CDP fires a carefully modulated energy pulse at an enemy starship which will temporarily disrupt certain computers aboard the target starship. The primarily affected function is autopilot. While all ship classes are different, the majority of the time the CDP will cause sluggish response in starship autopilot and can even disable it entirely. The effects are only temporary and the initial pulse does requi
23:47 re quite a bit of power, but it's nonetheless an effective weapon against ISC designed ships. The CDP is effective at ranges up to four units and requires six minutes to recharge, drawing power from the ship's main battery. Note that the weapon is not always effective. Under certain circumstances, it will fail to have an effect. This is always the case when using it against biological technology.
Range: 4 units
Recharge Time: 6 minutes
Effect: Slow down autopilot functions.
Usage: DISRUPT. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.
  Disarmament Pulse
The DP is a pulse weapon that will fire a burst of energy at an enemy starship that specifically targets (conventional) weapons.
Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 60 seconds
Effect: Causes small amounts of damage to one or more weapon systems on the target starship.
Usage: DISARM. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.
  Sensor Interruption Pulse
The sensor interruption pulse fires a directed burst of energy that's specifically modulated to cause damage to only a starship's sensor array.
Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 1 minute
Effect: Causes a small amount of damage to the target starship's sensor array.
Usage: INTERRUPT. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.
  Immobilization Pulse
The IP is a pulse weapon that, similar to the DP, will target only a ship's wormhole drive with the intent of immobilizing a target without the
23:47  use of interdictors.
Range: 1 unit
Recharge Time: 1 minute
Effect: Causes a small amount of damage to the target's wormhole drive.
Usage: IMMOBILIZE. You will be presented with a menu of targets in range.
  Autolocking Long-range Laser
Usage: LRL
  Standard Long-range Laser
Usage: Same as regular lasers.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.
