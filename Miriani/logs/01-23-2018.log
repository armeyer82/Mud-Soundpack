07:47 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a seashell-shaped ocean blue Hawaiian ginger air freshener, and a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall here.
You see Kitty Mars (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) here, sleeping.
You can go south.

You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a seashell-shaped ocean blue Hawaiian ginger air freshener, and a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall here.

14:14 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a dragon-shaped gold ring with a thin sign engraved into it, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, and a red spacesuit navigational computer.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) (hostile environment)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt, Paws the droid, a black cat, a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes, a fluffy blue cat, Kissy the droid, Kitcat the droid, a transparent trash can, a large soft purple pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an orange tabby kitten, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a transparent architectural design simulator, Mekensie the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a bright turquoise cooler, a large sandstone fireplace with a stone harth and a teak mantel, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a stack of neatly split logs, a large white refrigerator, and a compact bright red cooler with zip up compartments along the sides here.
You see Kitty Mars (staring into space) (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) here.
You can go south, down, and out.

19:34 Space.

19:34 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

19:34 Nothing happens. Perhaps you should ensure that main power is enabled in the SYSTEMS in the engineering room.

19:34 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

19:34 You stand up.

21:51 Kitty Mars
She is a member of the AIE alliance.
She is awake and looks alert.
This thin woman appears to be in her mid-thirties and stands 5 feet and 5 inches tall with a large bust size. She has a slightly tanned complexion. She is wearing a tiny gold hair clip made out of shell in her shoulder-length, champagne blonde hair, which is layered. She has violet eyes with a button nose above white, perfectly straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a purple energy field.

["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) (hostile environment)
You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a seashell-shaped ocean blue Hawaiian ginger air freshener, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, and a pair of gray sneakers with red laces here.

Tibo,
you have to understand that I am a rather private person. What you said in that mis-com was a bit insightful in that you were saying something to cause Amore to be judgemental by saying 'kitty is refusing thus far'. You only brought up being friends this evening and I never refused that so that's not being fair don't you think? I jus feel that if friends are there to help us both then they should be mutual friends and I don't consider Amore to be a mutual friend as she has not done anything but communicate with just you. Therefore, she is only hearing just your side of the issues. So all you had to say when I asked the first time that you request that amore stay out of our affairs, then you could have come back and said that she was encouraging you to work with me. Then I would certainly be more trusting of her motives. In truth, we do have to be best friends too if we're going to grow into another phase. Friends trust one another and friends have your back. Lovers don't always have those qualities. If all that I can have with you is friendship, then I am willing to be that even though I won't stop loving you. I will just have to keep my feelings to myself. It doesn't mean we can't enjoy sex though as you don't have to love me to have sex with me. I enjoy it with you so I'm willing to accept your sudden change of heart.
As for traveling out to get our ships, I will be very grateful to have your assistance. Also, I am still willing to do additional traveling to help you earn more artifacting points and your Radio Receiver components. I have traveled before with friends and I do enjoy working with you in this respect.
Your friend,
Kitty

Amore,
During the trip that Kitty and I took out of locals to get her ship, we had plenty of time to talk about her and my relationship in the past. I won't go into very many details, but we did discuss something that you might be interested in.
During many discussions, I have expressed to Kitty that I am a very affectionate and flirtatious person. She understand this and also knows that many of her and my issues in the past arose because of lack of communication between her and me. Anyways, I did tell her that some time ago, you did ask me regarding participation in a threesome or foursome. I did explain to her that the foursome was in case she and I were together.
She expressed that what made her uncomfortable was the fact that she has not had an opportunity to get to know you. She has no desire to do anything that would hurt your relationship with Matt. She also reiterated that she wishes not to be touched sexually by another woman. I assured her that you did not have a desire to be intimate with her. So, in order for Kitty to feel comfortable enough to consider such an activity or arrangement, she would need to have some social interaction with you. 
If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to talk to either of us.
Sincerely,
Tibo
