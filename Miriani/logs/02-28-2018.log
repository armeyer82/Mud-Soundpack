["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several
01:28  shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

You can go south.

01:57 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:57 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

01:57 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

01:57 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

01:57 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

01:57 The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."

01:57 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

01:57 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:57 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:57 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:57 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:57 The ship must be in space to do that.

01:57 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

01:57 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has jumped into the sector.
The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:57 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:57 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:57 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:57 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

01:57 I don't understand that.

01:57 The ship must be in MANUAL mode.

01:57 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:57 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles.

Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

02:09 ["Snorting Coffee Maker of Hate" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret here.
You can go northwest.

02:09 Blotto Hendrix's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "if she's a bad gunner on top of rude I'm just going to throw her off after the first one without warning"

02:11 Cara West's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "Don't blame you. No clue what her problem is tonight."

02:11 Brianna West's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "I definitely don't blame you"

02:11 You hear the sounds of somebody attempting to enter the airlock, but they're turned away by the locked hatch.

02:11 Blotto Hendrix's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "getting the mission"

02:12 #$#soundpack_pong

02:12 #$#soundpack_lag 108

02:12 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

02:12 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:12 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

02:12 #$#soundpack social | giggle | female

02:12 Cara West's voice comes over the intercom, saying through a fit of giggles, "Aww I don't have pulses to play with."

02:12 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:12 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

02:12 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

02:12 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

02:12 Blotto Hendrix's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "bought this an hour ago"

02:12 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

02:12 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

02:12 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:12 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:12 Cara West's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "damn!"

02:13 #$#soundpack_pong

02:13 #$#soundpack_lag 107

02:13 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:13 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:13 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:13 Cara West's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "so we're popping this thing's mission cherry. fun times"

02:13 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:13 Blotto Hendrix's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "indeed"

02:13 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

10:51 [Newbie] Ivan Cardenas: Okay, so what's the difference between docking inside of a ship, and using the docking ring?

10:51 [Newbie] Ciaran Shepherd: Docking to a ship allows you to walka cross, but it doesn't allow the ship inside. Docking inside means the ship can be then transported by the bigger ship.

10:56 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Ciaran ,very helpful, Ivan, when you dock via a dock ring its for transfering charge,ammo requires additional upgrades modules, and so on, when the ship is docked inside you can have that ship carried from place to place.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Docking Bay.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large ce

Be not mistaken friends, love is not to possess or imprison, nor to lose one's self in another. Love is to join and separate, to walk alone and together, to find a laughing freedom that lonely isolation does not permit. Love only endures when it moves like waves, receding and returning gently or passionately, or moving lovingly like the tide in the moon's own predictable harmony, because finally, despite scars or fears, they are openly free to be who they really are - and always secretly were. This is what we celebrate today."

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun tur
13:31 ret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

13:32 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the three-person heliogaster "Oryx" and the one-person fighter "Child of Sin" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Chitter the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, Beta the droid, Alphy the droid, Mjolnir the droid, Strike the droid, Sinister the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.

13:33 You sit down on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end.

13:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:33 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

13:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:33 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

13:33 The ship is already moving.

13:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:33 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:33 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:33 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:33 The sensors are unable to pinpoint the starship's current coordinates.

13:33 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:33 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:34 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

13:34 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

13:34 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

13:34 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:34 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

13:34 I don't understand that.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:34 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:34 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:34 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:34 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:34 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

13:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

13:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:34 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:34 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

13:36 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer.

13:39 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:39 The three-person heliogaster "Aqueous Transmission" has left the sector.

13:39 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:39 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:39 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:39 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

13:39 Current coordinates: 15, 16, 16

13:39 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

13:39 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

13:39 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

13:39 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

13:39 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:39 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

13:39 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.

13:41 You sit down on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end.

13:41 You can't launch from here.

13:41 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:41 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

13:41 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

13:41 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."
The computer announces, "The wavewarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

13:41 You're already sitting down.

13:41 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

13:42 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:42 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:42 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:42 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:42 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

13:42 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:42 The computer announces, "Wavewarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8"

13:42 You hear a gentle pulsing sound as the starship begins an intrasector wavewarp.

13:42 The starship shudders beneath your feet as it continues propelling itself forward.

13:42 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector wavewarp. The pulsing sound stops as the wavewarp drive powers down.

13:42 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

13:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

13:42 The computer announces, "The slip drive has completed its charging cycle."

13:42 You peer out and see...

13:42 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the six-person dart "Preggnoso Ingorgio", the four-person roborant "Sanatized Insanitarium", the ten-person battlecruiser "Undying Dissidence", and the seven-person expeditioner "Vox" landed here.

Grouped Room Poses
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  GROUP-POSE
Description:
  Grouped room poses allow you to assign a single room pose to a number of different objects. This prevents redundancy in the room description and lets you do things that you wouldn't ordinarily be able to do with standard groups.
  To start, you will want to create a new pose. You can use the GROUP-POSE command or, for short, GPOSE. This will open a simple menu of choices. Choose the "New Group Pose" option and type in your pose. For our example, we'll say: "piled in front of a control console"
  The next question asks if you want the pose to appear before or after the list of objects. If you say before, then your pose will be printed first and then the objects after it. (e.g. a heavy blanket covering <objects>.) If you choose after, then the opposite will be true. For our example, we'll choose after.
  Once your pose is created, nothing will happen at all! Not very useful. So go back into the GPOSE command and select the pose you just created. This will present you with a new menu that allows you to add objects, remove objects, change the pose position (before or after the object list), edit the pose, or delete it entirely.
  After the objects have been added, LOOK and you will see that they're now all together and associated with the pose you set. That's all there is to it!
  NOTE: If you want posed objects to
13:44  appear on their own line, you can do so from the ROOM-OPTIONS command. At the time of this writing it's option 20, 'Separate Grouped Room Poses From Normal Contents'
Restrictions:
  * If you have something after your name in parenthesis, your pose will not appear. This prevents overriding pre-programmed systems with custom text.
  * You can't use another player's name after a comma or the word AND to prevent tricking people into thinking they're doing something that they aren't.
  * At present, you're limited to 100 character poses.
  * Poses cannot contain parenthesis.
  * If you're found to be abusing the command, you will have your ability to use it revoked.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a black rosewood end table, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a
20:48  large central video screen. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, Mekensie the droid, and Jenaia the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

20:48 You ponder for a moment and reflect.

20:49 You say, "I'm not sure. I think I have just about everything."

20:49 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

20:49 Katrianne Beauchene asks, "is your insurance paid?"

20:50 #$#soundpack_pong

20:50 #$#soundpack_lag 128

20:50 You say, "No, I haven't gotten any insurance for my ships yet."

20:50 You say, "I do plan on it though."

20:50 --------------------------------------------------

20:50 Insurance
--------------------------------------------------
  Description:
Every starship pilot has access to a private insurance fund. By visiting an ATM, you're able to place credits into an insurance account that will insure your starship against twice the amount of credits in the account. Assuming you have half the worth of your ship in your insurance account, you will receive the full worth for your ship upon its destruction, essentially ensuring that your replacement ship is half off.
  Procedure:
* Find an ATM and type: USE ATM.
* Locate the option to add to insurance fund.
  Example:
You have a cargo hauler that's worth 2,000,000 credits.
You place 1,000,000 credits into your insurance fund.
Your cargo hauler gets destroyed.
You receive 2,000,000 credits and your insurance fund goes to 0 credits.
  Notes:
You will NOT be able to withdraw credits from your insurance fund. Once you put them into the fund, the only way to get them back is to lose a starship. Also be aware that you will not get an insurance payout if your starship is destroyed with the SELF-DESTRUCT command, even if you have enough to cover its full worth.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a black rosewood end table, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen. You also see Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, a white trash bin, a shiny silver starship simulator, three 
21:23 translucent red security drones, and an internal stun turret here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You a
