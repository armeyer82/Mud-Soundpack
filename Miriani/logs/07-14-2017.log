The capttain was not necessarily clear on everything she wanted in a letter for prospect fleet additions, and the alliance representatives received some information that the general populous did not. However, I expect that most people have sent their letters in already, so instead of making a giant one-man push to get the info out, I am offering to help with any questions those still writing may have."

16:57 [ You shatter immersion and say, "I'm wondering if one of the things that is aggrivating the issue  with Kitty is culture. She's american and you're French. I don't like to think that, but it seems she's looking at this from an American point of view and you of course from the French." ]

16:58 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Pax (AIE Docking Station) to Miriani flight control, I'm showing a disruption in my controls. It must be an EM weapon."

16:59 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "and what difference does that make?" ]

16:59 [ You shatter immersion and say, "I'm not saying this in a bad way, but Americans have always viewed the French as more sexual and romantic and all that." ]

17:00 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "Well yes, but just someone is more sexual and romantic, doesn't mean the person exploids other people" ]

17:01 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "Actually it's the opposite, french people hate cheating or open relationships" ]

17:01 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "And sexual friendships and one night stands happen, but most of the french people I know don't like that either" ]

17:02 [ You shatter immersion and say, "I know, but that's what Americans view it as more often than not. They see the French, especially French women as being able to romantically infuence guys more easily. Americans have the money and since they can always win guys over with money or status, and the French just do it because they are more romantic, Americans get jealous." ]

17:02 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "We say that the americans like the one night stand style" ]

17:02 [ You shatter immersion and say, "This is true." ]

17:02 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Flight control in Bellerophon, we detect shots fired! Repeat, shots fired!"

17:03 [ You shatter immersion and say, "On the other hand, some americans work so hard to fight that reputation that they'll wait months, even years to be sexual with their partners." ]

17:03 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "Never heard about that. All the americans I got to know went on it kind of fast." ]

17:04 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "Or at least, not slow or like, for months or whatever" ]

17:04 [ You shatter immersion and say, "Heck, if I saw you in the U.S and gave you the traditional French greeting of a couple kisses on the cheek, most would say that I was flirting with you." ]

17:04 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "But yeah maybe kitty thinks that way, could be. But how does she know I'm french? I mean, in that game we're all american, somehow." ]

17:10 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "lol" ]

17:10 [ You shatter immersion and say, "The thing is in America, if you don't officially ask someone out, you're not officially dating. Therefore, one night stands often happen because one or the other never asked the other person out, turning their one night stand into a couple." ]

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the one-person expediter "Crystal Passion", the one-person cargo hauler "Haul Heavy", the three-person freighter "Collecting The Collectables", the three-person voyager "Beyond", and the one-person cargo hauler "Fire Jack" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Bran

This cozy, elegantly furnished living room has highly polished hardwood floors. The walls are drywall and painted a sky-blue. A ceiling fan in the shape of a majestic eagle hangs from the ceiling. Its wide wingspan causes a gentle breeze to flow throughout the room as the blades spins hypnotically. A tall zigzagged glass warm midnight blue lamp is casting a warm antique white light throughout the room. You see a black mahogany square-shaped wall clock and a life-sized painting in a gold frame hanging on the wall.
You see a large marble fireplace with a rosewood hearth and a rosewood mantel, a polished cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfortable ice white leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, two glass end tables, a tall zigzagged glass warm midnight blue lamp, a cherry wood trash bin, a midnight blue suede recliner, a glass coffee table with short spiraling white marble legs carved with leaves, a red beanbag chair, and a large red Persian rug here.

23:16 You say, "That was one thing I told Kitty in my letter. She claimed to love me, she gave me access to her apartment, her ships, but didn't trust me enough to be intimate with her. I guess somehow I failed in that respect."

23:17 Miriam Valleris asks, "Why is it you who failed?"

23:18 [Private | Therman Donaldson] You transmit, "I paid him for my ship and in return for not assisting anyone to attack him or attacking him myself, he won't attack me."

23:19 Miriam Valleris says, "I mean, she has a lot of money, a lot of points, is a pilot for a lon glong time, actually you should think she's married, has children, or at least a boyfriend"

23:19 [Private | Therman Donaldson] Therman Donaldson transmits, "not being a total prick, but there are so many holes in it that you might as well make a deal with a fucking pile of cottage cheese"

23:19 Miriam Valleris says, "but somehow it's not that way"

23:26 Miriam Valleris asks, "But what did she do if you tried doing sexual things?"

23:27 You say, "She said no. I'm not trying to be graphic.. but she wouldn't even let me take off her panties for months. Then she wouldn't let me touch her... intimate parts."

23:33 Miriam Valleris says, "At the time people used me to plan things, and then they executed the plans. Normally they worked."

23:33 You say, "for example, I asked her if I should get an expeditioner. She said no because it's a fragile ship out in uncharted space. I asked well what about if I docked a fighter in the dockingbay and she got mad at me and said I wasn't listening to her."
