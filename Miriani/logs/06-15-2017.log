02:36 >> Command Aborted <<

02:36 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The ten-person battlecruiser "Genocide" has left the sector.

02:36 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

02:36 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

02:36 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

02:36 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Magical Melody" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

02:36 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

02:36 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

02:36 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

02:36 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

02:36 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:36 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:36 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:36 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

02:36 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person transverser "Astraeus' Odyssey" has launched from Rolukssica.

03:20 ["Chain of Memories" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a thick covering of white sand covering the ground, a dark blue plastic cooler on wheels, a sapphire blue crystal dolphin-shaped Hostian sea scented air freshener plugged in to the wall, a large soft ocean blue and white seashell shaped area rug placed in the center of the room, an enormous dark purple cloth beach blanket, two fuzzy blue medical drones, two fuzzy blue security drones, Fix the droid, Mend the droid, a flappy duck on wheels, Caly the droid, and Mikey the droid here.

03:21 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

03:21 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

03:21 You hear several clinking sounds as the ship is repaired.

03:21 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

03:21 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

03:56 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Beta."

03:56 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

03:56 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

03:56 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

03:56 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

03:56 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

03:56 The ship must be in space to do that.

03:56 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

03:56 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

03:56 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:56 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:56 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

03:56 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

03:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

03:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.

23:56 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:56 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:56 There are no ships here.

23:56 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:56 You hear a shrill screeching sound as repair drones drag replacement components across the hull.

23:56 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:56 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The four-person roborant "Chain of Memories" has initiated an intrasector slip.

23:56 You hear a deafening booming sound as repairs to the ship proceed.

23:56 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The four-person roborant "Chain of Memories" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

23:56 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:56 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

23:56 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

23:56 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

23:56 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

23:56 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:56 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:56 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:56 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."
