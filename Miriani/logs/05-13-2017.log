06:20 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a leather-covered oak navigator's chair, a metallic white starship simulator, an overstuffed royal blue leather love seat, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south, down, and out.

06:20 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", the five-person transverser "Remnants", the six-person dart "Bubbling Crappily", the ten-person battlecruiser "Retribution", the one-person expediter "Insanity", and the eight-person gunship "Warchild" landed here.

The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a leather-covered oak navigator's chair, a metallic white starship simulator, an overstuffed royal blue leather love seat, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.

07:08 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

07:08 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

07:08 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

07:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

07:08 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

07:08 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

07:08 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

07:08 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

07:09 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

07:09 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has jumped into the sector.

07:09 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

07:09 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

07:09 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

07:09 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

07:09 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

07:09 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

07:09 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

07:09 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

07:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

07:09 You can't power down the starship in space.

07:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

07:09 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has docked with Empanda Station.

07:09 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.

16:50 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

16:50 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

16:50 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

16:50 The eight-person gunship "Yamato" has launched from Acrylon.

16:50 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

16:50 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

16:50 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

16:50 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

16:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

16:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:51 The eight-person gunship "Yamato" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

16:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

16:51 [TSS] Tibo Beauchene transmits, "Good morning."

16:51 [TSS] Michael Calaway transmits, "Morning."

16:52 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

16:53 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) A compact red sanitation drone goes northwest.

16:53 From a thick white leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a red flight control scanner announce, "Flight control in Bellerophon, a ship is firing weapons here."

17:41 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Executioner's Assault", the five-person transverser "Remnants", the six-person dart "Bubbling Crappily", the ten-person battlecruiser "Retribution", the eight-person gunship "Warchild", and the one-person cargo transport "Acrylon Courier Transport 1243" landed here.

The change from docking bay to station interior is truly shocking. The gangway you had been traversing abruptly ends at the doorway, replaced by a length of soft, forest green carpeting. For every few feet of wall, there is an equally long window which displays the space outside the station. The sounds of people shouting, starship engines activating, and gangways clattering fade away gradually until the only sound is a gentle hum emanating from somewhere deep within the station's interior.

[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex]
The top of this spaceport pyramid has been flattened to allow for the safe launching and landing of the steady starship traffic. The floor is made of what once was a dark brown granite which has been faded to a pale tan hue from the years of heavy use. Surrounding a large white support column directly in the middle of the floor are four enormous metal elevating platforms which serve to transport ships to and from the garage directly above. On the four outer walls of this vast space are curving staircases which lead to the levels above and below. A few primary facilities surround this busy level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the Commonwealth evacuation ship "To What It Entails", the eight-person gunship "Cloud Nine", the four-person carrier "Trade Me", the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", and the five-person transverser "Remnants" landed here.

[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex]
The top of this spaceport pyramid has been flattened to allow for the safe launching and landing of the steady starship traffic. The floor is made of what once was a dark brown granite which has been faded to a pale tan hue from the years of heavy use. Surrounding a large white support column directly in the middle of the floor are four enormous metal elevating platforms which serve to transport ships to and from the garage directly above. On the four outer walls of this vast space are curving staircases which lead to the levels above and below. A few primary facilities surround this busy level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the Commonwealth evacuation ship "To What It Entails", the eight-person gunship "Cloud Nine", the four-person carrier "Trade Me", the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", and the five-person transverser "Remnants" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, froggy the droid, Tori the droid, Sumus the droid, Scorpio the droid, Clara the droid, Hotdog the droid, Ema the droid, Charmed the droid, Aura the droid, Wish the droid, Meda the droid, Tom the droid, Jaden the droid, Holland the droid, Zhia the droid, Kano the droid, Daniel the droid, Daizey the droid, Fluffy the droid, Buttercup the droid, Elisha the droid, Robby the droid, Jeff the droid, Ed the droid, Spank the droid, Kirah the droid, John the dr

20:30 Kylar Knight's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "unless you want to wait, but I'd like to try and make a dent"

20:30 Kylar Knight's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "tib is on his way too"

20:30 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Nah, let's make a dent"

20:30 From a thick white leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a red flight control scanner announce, "Flight control in Outreach, today is a good day to die, for the Praelor!"

20:31 [General Communication] Kylar Knight transmits, "Alright those of you who are coming, I will get you when I land again for repairs."

20:31 ["Freedom Fighter" Corridor One]
You see an internal stun turret, two fuzzy yellow security drones, and a compact green security drone here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

20:31 ["Freedom Fighter" Corridor Two]
You see an internal stun turret, a compact yellow security drone, a transparent blue security drone, and a glowing black security drone here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, up, and down.

20:31 [General Communication] Kylar Knight transmits, "Going to try and make a dent if I can."

20:31 You peer east and see...

20:31 ["Freedom Fighter" Weapons Room 6]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex.
You can go west.

20:31 ["Freedom Fighter" Weapons Room 6]
You can go west.

20:31 Kylar Knight's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "here we go"

20:31 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

20:31 The computer announces, "Control room reports: A star, forty-eight starships, two planets, debris, and a space station have been detected in the sector."

20:31 Praelor Onz 486: 3, 14, 17

20:31 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

20:31 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:31 From a thick white leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a red flight control scanner announce, "Deneii to Outreach flight control, another Praelor starship has been exterminated. This isn't war, it's pest control!"

20:31 The cannons are already loaded.

20:31 Praelor Onz 486: 3, 16, 18

20:31 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:31 The current target is no longer focused.

20:31 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:31 Current coordinates: 3, 3, 3

20:31 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

20:31 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

20:40 ["Freedom Fighter" Weapons Room 4]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex.
You can go east.

20:40 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Olivia?"

20:40 A message from Kylar Knight is piped through the ship's intercom from the external PA. You hear him say, "here"

[Angelus; Spaceport Pyramid; Landing Apex]
The top of this spaceport pyramid has been flattened to allow for the safe launching and landing of the steady starship traffic. The floor is made of what once was a dark brown granite which has been faded to a pale tan hue from the years of heavy use. Surrounding a large white support column directly in the middle of the floor are four enormous metal elevating platforms which serve to transport ships to and from the garage directly above. On the four outer walls of this vast space are curving staircases which lead to the levels above and below. A few primary facilities surround this busy level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the Commonwealth evacuation ship "To What It Entails", the eight-person gunship "Cloud Nine", the four-person carrier "Trade Me", the ten-person battlecruiser "Remains of The Shadow", the five-person transverser "Remnants", and the ten-person battlecruiser "Thanatos" landed here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

22:26 [Jump Hub Station; Docking Bay]
Despite not being the true center of the station the docking bay is undoubtedly the main hub of activity. Countless numbers of pilots as well as people seeking transportation on a ship come and go, walking up stairs that lead to gangways that are out of the way of taxiing starships. Looking up you can see many gangways that form a tangled web which appears to climb forever. Almost constantly the sound of the bay doors opening and closing can be heard, allowing a starship to enter or leave the station.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the seven-person expeditioner "Bomb" and the ten-person battlecruiser "Thanatos" landed here.

22:38 ["Freedom Fighter" Weapons Room 4] (sitting on the floor)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

22:42 ["Freedom Fighter" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a fuzzy yellow security drone, a fuzzy red security drone, a compact blue security drone, a rotating alien bone showcase with a device flashing numerous alien symbols mounted above the doors, and a realistic looking hovering kookaburra gadget bot here.

23:08 ["Freedom Fighter" Weapons Room 4]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You can go east.

23:08 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights continue to flash overhead.

23:08 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

23:15 ["Freedom Fighter" Weapons Room 4] (lying on the floor)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Jump Hub Station; Docking Bay.
You can go east.

23:15 You sit up.

23:16 ["Freedom Fighter" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Jump Hub Station; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, a fuzzy yellow security drone, a fuzzy red security drone, a compact blue security drone, a rotating alien bone showcase with a device flashing numerous alien symbols mounted above the doors, and a realistic looking hovering kookaburra gadget bot here.
You see Noah Holland (lying on the floor) and Kylar Knight here.
You can go east, south, and west.

23:16 You peer south and see...

23:16 ["Freedom Fighter" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Jump Hub Station; Docking Bay.

23:17 [Jump Hub Station; Docking Bay]
Despite not being the true center of the station the docking bay is undoubtedly the main hub of activity. Countless numbers of pilots as well as people seeking transportation on a ship come and go, walking up stairs that lead to gangways that are out of the way of taxiing starships. Looking up you can see many gangways that form a tangled web which appears to climb forever. Almost constantly the sound of the bay doors opening and closing can be heard, allowing a starship to enter or leave the station.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the seven-person expeditioner "Bomb" and the three-person voyager "Syntaxi" landed here.
You see a shiny silver trashcan, Eram the droid, Freckles the droid, Flis the droid, Robbie the droid, RightThen the droid, a glowing green security drone, a translucent green security drone, Lurker the droid, Kimberly the droid, Carlos the droid, Fog the droid, an Easter basket dispenser, a gleaming gray medical drone, a gleaming red medical drone, a gleaming gray security drone, two gleaming black security drones, two gleaming red security drones, a gleaming black medical drone, and a gleaming blue security drone here.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Quazicol Spaceport; Landing Bay.

A truly brilliant sight is visible just outside of the large glass dome. An ocean of lava surrounds the entire spaceport. Waves of it splash against the rocky shore, spatters of lava hitting the dome and sliding down with a sizzle. A red glow is cast throughout the landing bay, reflecting off the shiny hulls of ships taking off and landing through a hatch in the top of the dome. Sliding doors to the north and east are almost constantly open as people pass through on their way to and from other parts of the spaceport.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.
