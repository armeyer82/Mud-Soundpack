Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small
purple trash bin, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies
across the toes here.

Subject: Project Alpha 777
Date: June 1st 2317 
Hello,
This letter is to inform you about a final decision I have made on behalf of
Starseekers with regards of making rift inserters available for this project.
Let me first explain that this decision is not to do with Starseeker's amount of
megacredits, points or anything else. Starseekers is always willing to help
newer pilots, and will continue to do so while I am its leader. So, whether
Alpha 777 is actually helping newer pilots is the defining factor in the
decision I reached.
So, how helpful is 777 to newer pilots? Most pilots go through a phase where
they believe that shipwrecks earn them industry points faster than anything
else. I've gone through it as well, so I know how it works. Generally speaking,
a pilot does one load of shipwrecks, one load of commets, and bam, shipwrecks
give more points. This is not really an accurate measure though. Travel time to
777, as well as the time to grapple and then expel larger pieces need to be
taken into account, and then the conclusion is that local places such as Belt of
Orion can lead to similar results just as fast, and without as much
encouragement to grind senselessly.
Another matter worth considering are artifacts. The opinions on this are
somewhat mixed, but if you take travel time into account again, and the fact
that both in Battle of Mir and in 777 you can have lucky days where you find
artifacts quickly, and days where the hunt goes slowly, it would seem there is
not all that much difference. The payout for these artifacts is also really the
same.
Even if you were to disagree with me on those 2 points, safety of our newer
pilots is a big concern. I keep hearing stories about newer pilots getting in
trouble with IFS and pirates. Watchtowers are nice things, but whether a pilot,
particularly one with a slower engine, can actually land successfully with the
long range lasers, is a question I can not answer positively with yes. Chances
are that too many newer pilots get their ships damaged or even destroyed, in
some cases even needing to be rescued by more experienced pilots. Take into
account that light transports only have 4 hours of charge, the newer pilots we
intend to help with 777 actually really have quite a few obstacles to deal with.
Another matter that probably also was a big defining factor for me was your
patience, or lack of it. 2 weeks ago, Melinda told me she was going to see if
similar locations could be found closer to home. I advised evenia to hold off on
replacing the stations because of this reason. Although nothing suitable was
found, the least that could have been done was for you to give us a chance.
Instead, you chose to replace these stations anyway without inserters, which is
your right if you wish. You also chose to ferry newer pilots who do not yet have
rift drives across in your carriers. That is all good and well, until the point
where I have to hear from Morris that you are unhappy with the work this brings.
The world does not stop turning when people have to live without 777's
shipwrecks for a few weeks. This haste and impatience leads me to believe that
new pilots are not all this is about. Personal advancement of pilots with plenty
points to salvage anywhere they like, and maybe the advancement of your org
which is working hard for its command points, seem to be just as much on your
minds here. That is not wrong, but, and forgive me if this sounds harsh, not the
reason why we would want to be involved in 777.
There has been a lot of debate going on about these stations ever since they
were first built. On behalf of Starseekers, I have decided that supplying rift
inserters for this project is not really reaching the goal of helping newer
pilots. For this reason we are pulling out of 777 as of this date. To prevent us
from continuing to go in circles, I also have decided that Starseekers will not
revisit this decision for at least another 365 days.
I can understand this decision is disappointing. Once you reach sufficient
command points you can build what you wish, but we will not support 777 from
here on out for the reasons offered in this writing.
With kind regards,
Kim Saunders
Starseekers Founder

considering any org."

would like you to join Space explorers then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that the org
you're in?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, that is Lily and
Shule's. I am the founder of Starseekers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do you guys
get up to?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are the orgs
mostly about sharing resources?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And planning
expeditions and such?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, it is safe to
say you of course would be welcome in Starseekers. But, the choice needs to be
yours, not someone else's. So, ask questions, ask yourself, what kind of org do
I want to be a part of. Do I even want in an org, and then make the choice that
you think fits with you. Resource sharing is definitely a big part of it, so is
making ships available for rent. I really don't want that to be all we do, and
hope we can organize a party or something, maybe go to NQ one day, or Sage's
redoubt and Rogers. And yes, sometimes orgs also organize expeditions, or that
salvage op thing we did out of comms range a few weeks ago, that you may have
heard of."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I didn't hear
about that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Orgs also have a lot
to do with the plants that enhance starships, you may have heard about them too.
We grow them and sell them, each org has their own. Some orgs give benifits to
their members on the plants, some may not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have heard of
plants."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I didn't
realize we had different orgs within the AEU."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll definitely
talk to you sometime about what Starseekers do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, we went to this
oort cloud 80 lightyears south of Campeche where we set up a bunch of temp
stations and did salvage ops, hauled roids, and had a lot of fun. Business cats
was the main organizer, but all orgs helped out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that sounds
cool."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like we
don't get up to salvage ops a lot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The AEU, that
is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, and for a little
while, I am sure we won't get the interests at all, 25 salvage ops in less than
a week is a lot, people are burned out. But safe to say we rocked those goals."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, there are 3
active orgs in the AEU at the moment. Ather runs space invaders. Whether he
accepts members I don't know. I run Starseekers with the help of Evangeline and
Morris. And Lily and Shule have Space explorers amidst the stars. There are
more, but they are not active."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I guess the
orgs can span across alliances, then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I think
Morris is a Starseeker?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you just
said that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry, the
hauling run kept me out way later than I expected."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, orgs can choose
to let members of different alliances in. Starseekers is an AEU org, but I broke
unity, that is, let members from other alliances join in. We lost a lot of org
points, are rebuilding, but it's been worth it very much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
interesting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that is an
interesting dynamic."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Do you know where the
org centre is in the space port on New Earth?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Especially with
the way AEU politics are going in general."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I admire that
you guys do that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, by the
license point center, right? I think I've passed by it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do not support the
isolationist movement at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Me neither."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Actually it's
what brought me here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, there is one,
and also on the upper floor of the liaison office building. You can find
information on all public orgs there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I had always
though I'd be a career academic."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But even the
institutions on New Earth are turning all their funding inward."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I know.
Worrying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's cool,
I'll definitely check that out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And probably
talk to you about it more this week."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Speaking of
which, I had two things to run by you."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That sounds cool. Ask
questions, and decide where you would feel at home."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And then I gotta
get some much needed rack time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "First, I know
Ather will be gone on the expedition, and I believe Shule and Lily will also."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather dutifully
checks our sectors every day for threats. I thought maybe you could take me on a
run once, and then maybe I could do it a couple times."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So far, I know Ather,
Vernos and Eli are, not sure on Shule and Lily."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I should
probably grab a felo though, in case I see anything nasty."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "He does it through
his terminal, but sure, I can show you how its down."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought he
was actually flying around."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, more than 1
felo."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that's
less involved than I thought then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, he is not gonna
be there to do it through his terminal. So, we will have to do it manually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Perfect."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if you
could use the help, I'd be happy to do it any day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I will sure teach
you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And then, I was
in Landfall earlier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't been
since I was a kid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Nice town, isn't it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The Intrepid is
so impressive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, and
actually I noticed there's an apartment building there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I was
thinking it could be cool, though admittedly the travel time is sort of
inconvenient."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it seemed
like no units were available."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Sure thing. And, I
have seen that. We can't rent there though, not sure why."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, ok. I
figured as much, I just wanted to ask."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I don't know whether
we have ever been able to rent there, certainly not since I joined the corps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The place in New
Phoenix seems expensive for being underground."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, the apartments
are not more expensive than at the calm which is a space station, but to get
started, the deposit... yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought
rent at the calm was cheaper."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uhm, I didn't think
so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have never rented
there, only looked."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, maybe the
underground place isn't so bad then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have an apartment
there, but... I don't really go there often enough, might just give it up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I can't
really decide if it's worth it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I sleep in my
aereal fortress right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is at
least spacious."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That is not a bad
place to sleep. I also sleep in a ship most of the time these days."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oof, speaking
of."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I better hit the
rack."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll look into
the orgs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And talk to you
a bunch this week, I'm sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Right, anything else
you wanted to ask, or was that all?"

good for now."

one."
