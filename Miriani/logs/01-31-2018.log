["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship s

You see Kitty Mars (sitting on a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt) here, sleeping.
You can go south, down, and out.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.

01:34 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

01:34 You stand up.

01:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.

The nails on her left hand are painted shimmering pink and the nails on her right hand are painted shimmering pink.
She is not wearing a top. For a bottom, she is wearing a delicately pleated lavender skirt over a violet silk g-string embroidered with tiny red roses. She is wearing a multistrand cascading purple amethyst belly chain around her waist. She is also wearing a pink flight control scanner, a pair of beautiful rose gold and amethyst earrings, a narrow tri-colored gold anklet engraved with seashells, a transparent wristwatch, a two-tone gold bracelet embedded with amethysst, an amethyst pendant hanging from a long gold chain, a long necklace made of smoothly polished light purple amethyst stones, a handmade ring made of amethyst and multi-colored stones, a cute tortie cat backpack, a dark-purple leather shoulder bag patterned with manticores, a pink ar

13:17 ["Mischief" Room 1] (indoors) (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) (hostile environment)
You see nothing special. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see a large painting in a rosewood frame and an enormous oval mirror hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. There is a small starmap viewing terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a lily-shaped waterfall fountain, a wicker nightstand, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte coral lavender lamp, a lavender brocade settee, a rosewood California king loft bed, a tall white wooden entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a seashell-shaped ocean blue Hawaiian ginger air freshener, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, and a pair of white platform sandals here.
You see Kitty Mars (lying on a rosewood California king loft bed) here, sleeping.
You can go south.

13:17 A seashell-shaped ocean blue Hawaiian ginger air freshener freshens the room with the scent of Hawaiian ginger.

13:17 You lean in toward Kitty Mars and gently kiss her lips.

13:18 You slip a red cotton polo with thin white stripes over your head where it rests comfortably on your torso.

13:18 You slide your feet into a pair of gray sneakers with red laces.

13:18 For a top, you are wearing a red cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of gray sneakers with red laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a palladium ring set with a multifaceted cerulean blue dolphin-shaped gem, a dragon-shaped gold ring with a thin sign engraved into it, a platinum Commoveo membership ring, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a sleek black leather carrying case, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, an asteroid hauling kit, a black stun armor storage bag, a black rolled toolkit, a red spacesuit jet, and a red spacesuit navigational computer.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee tab

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rockin
17:20 g chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt, Paws the droid, a black cat, a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes, a fluffy blue cat, Kissy the droid, Kitcat the droid, a transparent trash can, a large soft purple pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an orange tabby kitten, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a transparent architectural design simulator, Mekensie the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a bright turquoise cooler, a large sandstone fireplace with a stone harth and a teak mantel, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a stack of neatly split logs, a large white refrigerator, a compact bright red cooler with zip up compartments along the sides, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a pink handheld planetary surveyor here.

17:21 You will once again see all starship movement messages. (Silent mode disengaged.)

17:21 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

17:22 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.

["Mischief" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a white saxony carpet. You see an enormous oval mirror, a translucent clock, and a large painting depicting a clear waterfall rushing down a slope lined with red and purple bushes hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the rose tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see three pink security drones, an internal stun turret, a tall textured porcelain matte gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a transparent seashell white glass low table with an ocean blue ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a transparent starship simulator, a
18:35  velvet loveseat, a glass coffee table, an ocean blue suede hand-tooled rocking chair, a velvet recliner, a squashy bright purple fluffy sectional sofa covered by a matching quilt, Paws the droid, a black cat, a fluffy white cat with big blue eyes, a fluffy blue cat, Kissy the droid, Kitcat the droid, a transparent trash can, a large soft purple pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an orange tabby kitten, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a transparent architectural design simulator, Mekensie the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a bright turquoise cooler, a large sandstone fireplace with a stone harth and a teak mantel, Maggie the bot, Joe the BBQ Guy, a stack of neatly split logs, a large white refrigerator, a compact bright red cooler with zip up compartments along the sides, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.

18:35 The computer announces, "The nearest navigational beacon is located in Sector 37 and is 90.5 lightyears distant."

18:35 A fresh cloud of frozen water crystals rains down upon the room, drifting lazily down until it impacts the deck plating, where it immediately melts. Seconds later, the sound of rushing air comes somewhere from within the walls.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Public Garage.

21:44 [Empanda Station; Public Garage]
Large robotic arms are constantly in motion transporting starships to and from the overhead docking bay in this cavernous starship garage. The echo from the launching and landing of ships reverberates off the concrete walls, creating a cacophony of sound when combined with the mechanical whirl of the busy sanitation drones that dart among the powered down starships. Blue and white lines have been painted onto the stone floor, serving as markings to keep the ships in some semblance of organization. Every so often, one of the large metallic arms will pick up a starship and transfer it to another area of the garage to optimize the available space.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go south and up.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.

21:48 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the six-person destroyer "Phantom Flame" powered down here.
You see the seven-person expeditioner "The Khmer", the eight-person gunship "Imminent Demise", and the three-person antagonizer "Vae Victis" landed here.
You see a shiny purple claw machine, Wiggles the droid, Sum the droid, Jimm the droid, Karli the droid, Stalker the droid, Nazma the droid, Peaches the droid, Prince the droid, Meo the droid, Marina the droid, Lisa the droid, Punch the droid, Rat the droid, Android the droid, Fay the droid, Jazmin the droid, Twit the droid, Rar the

You can go northeast, south, west, up, and down.

21:48 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

21:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

21:48 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

21:48 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:49 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

21:49 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:49 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

21:49 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:49 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

21:49 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:49 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 11, 10, 5."

21:49 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:49 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:49 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:49 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:49 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

21:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

21:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:28 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

22:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:28 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

22:28 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

22:28 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:28 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:28 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:28 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:29 #$#soundpack_lag 105

22:29 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:29 The ship must be in space to do that.

22:29 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:29 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:29 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 9, 5, 3."

22:29 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:29 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:29 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:29 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:29 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

22:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

22:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:29 You peer out and see...

22:29 [Poseidon Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking bay is fairly busy, with uniformed spaceport personnel rushing back and forth across the gleaming metal platform of the main landing area. 	The docking array system is located at the bottom of the station, although most of the machinery involved, including the massive airlocks that allow for large ships to dock, is not accessible to anyone other than station personnel. Several large windows have been set into the walls, showing a starscape that constantly spins due to the station's rotation. Several cylindrical escalator wells extend upwards to the floor above.
You see the three-person supercarrier "Home Beyond" powered down here.
You see Zero the droid here.

22:29 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

22:32 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | powered | safe | light | indoors

22:32 ["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

22:32 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

22:32 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:32 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

22:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

22:32 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:32 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

22:32 You're already sitting down.

22:32 You're already buckled in.

22:32 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:32 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:32 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:32 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:32 The computer announces, "Seven planets have been detected in the sector."

22:32 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:32 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 11, 11, 5."

22:32 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:32 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:32 The starship is already moving.

22:32 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:32 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

22:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Herto Spaceport; Landing Pad. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a black rosewood end table. You also see three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a shiny silver starship simulator, a white trash bin, and a tall oak wood entertainment center with
22:35  several shelves surrounding a large central video screen here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

22:35 You have 2,193,819,175.45 credits.

22:35 You begin the launch sequence.

22:35 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

22:35 The computer announces, "Seven planets have been detected in the sector."

22:35 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

22:35 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

22:35 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

22:35 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

22:36 #$#soundpack_pong

22:36 #$#soundpack_lag 104

22:36 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

22:36 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:36 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:36 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:36 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

22:36 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:36 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

22:36 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)
Planets: (4, 4, 7)

Space Stations: (15, 6, 4), (10, 14, 9), (9, 13, 9), (10, 13, 9), (11, 13, 9), and (10, 12, 9)
Stars: (10, 9, 5)
Jumpgates: (18, 2, 8)
Current Coordinates: (12, 16, 5)

22:36 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:36 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:36 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:36 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

22:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starlight Express. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

22:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:36 You must be in space to fire the disarmament pulse.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. You see a well-kept Commonwealth flag depicting a bright yellow sun with beaming rays shining on a field of cyan hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Public Garage.

Her waist-length, midnight black hair is pulled back in an elegant French twist and tied back with white silk ribbons and dotted with shimmering blue sapphires and diamonds. She has expressive jade green eyes with a snub nose above brilliantly white, straight teeth. Her abdomen is heavily rounded, and her hips seem to have widened considerably. She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a faint azure glow.
She has a tattoo of a sapphire blue flaming dragon on her right shoulder.
She has a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her left earlobe and a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with smoky silver eyeshadow. She is wearing light red lip gloss on her lips.

For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of faded blue boot cut jeans with silver studs on the pockets over a black g-string with tiny metallic studs. She is wearing a pair of sexy black leather combat boots over a pair of ribbed black anklet socks on her feet. She is wearing a black leather belt with a rose shaped buckle around her waist. She is also wearing a lovely rose gold ring with "my love" engraved on it, a round gold-trimmed locket on a silver chain, a rose gold signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, an emerald-studded sterling silver digital pocketwatch with a square crystal display, a simple white gold chain with a glowing crystal sphere encrusted with numerous precious gems dangling from it, a black leather purse with an ornate silver rose-shaped clasp, a black leather briefcase, a sparkly black suede diaper bag patterned with lions, a softly padded black snuggly, a light orange padded satin all-purpose sling, a compact silver Lore computer, two black metafrequency communication pins, a black metafrequency earpiece, a black metafrequency communicator, an ammunition storage container

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise.

[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.

23:25 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

23:25 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person destroyer "Dark Bandis" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

23:25 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

23:40 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
