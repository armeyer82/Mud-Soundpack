Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of
spider chow, a black upholstered sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft
black shamak fur, a small blueberry trash bin, a small red ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an insulated green cooler, a compact white
refrigerator, a red plastic food storage container, a small blue ball containing
a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Ciera the humanoid service robot, Kiwi the
little calico CatBot, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, Meow

Star Conquest Help: Common Knowledge
--
Category: Background
--
THINGS THAT EVERY PILOT KNOWS
About life in general...
* Known Space is the sphere of space that humanity has explored, roughly
centered, for obvious reasons, around Old Earth.
* Humanity has expanded to many worlds within Known Space, and has built several
large space stations for various purposes.
* Several alien artifacts also exist, and almost seem to have been left on
purpose. One of these, The Torus, is settled by humans too.
* Very few worlds and space stations are independent, but rather have banded
together into groups reflecting their common interests. These groups are known
generally simply as "alliances," and are roughly equivalent to what sovereign
nations were on Old Earth. There are five alliances currently recognized in
Known Space.
* Generally, each alliance maintains a "pilot league," which is a special group
of citizens granted licenses allowing them to operate starships for the benefit
of their alliance. The pilot league is civilian, but alliances also maintain a
separate military presence in space.
* Every person in Known Space is a citizen of whichever alliance they were born
into (with the exception of unregistered persons). Switching citizenship is
rare.
* Most citizens are not pilots and rarely leave the world they call home. People
from other alliances, and by extension the pilots that interact freely with
these people, are not entirely trusted.
* The currency in Known Space is the credit: a unit of electronic currency. Of
the currencies that were in use immediately before the Standard Credit, the U.S.
Dollar and the Euro come the closest to being equivalent to its value.
About life as a pilot...
* Pilots have a special relationship with their alliance. They receive vast sums
of money and the opportunity to go into space, in return for making money for
their alliance and a lonely existence with most of their rights as citizens
stripped away.
* Pilots of most alliances must pass a course from a flight school before being
granted a license. This takes about two years. Mutuality pilots have no formal
licensing requirement, though 9th Fleet pilots are granted an equivalent to a
license.
* Pilots are distrusted by the average citizen, not only because of their
frequent contact with other alliances, but also because of their vast wealth,
which can destabilize local economies on some planets.
* Pilots are barred from visiting most locations on a planet, even, often, their
former homes.
* Even though pilots earn vast sums of credits, they are in fact paying roughly
a 95% tax rate, the vast majority of their earnings going to their alliance.
This is the price for the ability to fly in space.
* Because pilots are so wealthy, many stores where pilots shop inflate their
prices by a factor of several thousand.
* Because becoming a pilot tends to cut one off for other people, pilots in
general tend to be loners, and only rarely engage in long-term relationships.
Pilot families are rare.
* Alliances consider their pilots extremely valuable and have done their best to
make starships as perfectly safe as possible. Each starship has a rescue pod
that will save the crew in the moments before destruction. Failure of these
rescue pods is extremely, almost impossibly rare. The only known instance of
rescue pods not arriving at the landing pad in the past 150 years is during a
handful of the fiercer battles of the Outsider War.
* Most pilots will be regarded by the average citizen as something of a
scoundrel, and are likely to be depicted thus by the media whenever the chance
arises. Heroism is recognized too, however, and some pilots can become minor
celebrities, almost household names, especially aces and particularly renowned
office-holders.
About the alliances...
* The League of Old Earth Democracies, or League, is considered ancient and
traditional, descended directly from the pre-colonization governments of the
homeworld. It is also considered by many to be overburdened by its old laws and
massive wealth.
* The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions, or AEU, is the result of humanity's initial
colonization effort during a period of great exploration and discovery. It still
values those ideals. Detractors consider the AEU's goals too lofty and
idealistic, and not sufficiently practical to deal with the realities of
humanity's presence in space.
* The Egalitarian Alliance of Sentients, or EAOS, is in fact only a human
chapter of a much larger Galactic EAOS. It was formed on the advice of text-only
communications left behind in the massive alien artifact known as The Torus, but
the purpose behind these instructions remains unclear. The EAOS currently
attracts many of the finest minds in Known Space. Enemies of the EAOS believe
that its superior technological capabilities have given the alliance a certain
air of elitism, and a degree of power over other alliances disproportionate to
its size. The EAOS' permanent citizens in fact maintain dual citizenship with
their alliance of origin. The EAOS has no pilot league of its own, but rather
appoints exceptional pilots from other alliances.
* The Confederation of Fringe Worlds, or Fringe, has its origin in the second
great wave of colonization. These are the most recently settled worlds, and the
poorest. Its members value above all the ability to simple eke out some kind of
survival on the edge of Known Space. Other alliances often dislike the Fringe
because of its casual attitude toward piracy and other less scrupulous
activities.
* The Sovereign Mutuality of Disparate Freemen, or Mutuality, is the mostly
recently recognized alliance, only acknowledged after offering aid during the
Resistance. It has its origin in a group of so-called "unregistered" people, who
lived outside Known Space and had allegiance to no alliance. Aside from
achieving official recognition, this group is largely unchanged, and is often
not trusted by the other alliances due to their long enmity with the
unregistered people.
* Other isolated groups exist, such as the Spinward Clans and Feng Wo
Collective, but these are not formally recognized alliances and tend to be
lumped together under the label "unregistered," just as the Mutuality was not so
many years ago. These are, however, individual and distinct cultures.
* The Allied Pirates also exist, seemingly a well-funded and well-organized
group that works against the alliances. Unlike past rebel groups, it is widely
believed that they draw their members principally from the alliances rather than
the unregistered. Their true agenda is not widely known, but is believed to be
the simple seizing of wealth and power.
About Known Space and its planets...
* The most populated planets of the League are Old Earth, Mars, Luna, Centauri,
Vesta, Callisto, in roughly that order.
* The most populated planets of the AEU are New Earth, Hyperion, Telex, Bikura,
Endymion, Aenea, in roughly that order.
* The most populated planets of the Fringe are Chetumal, Candelaria, Ars Magna,
Cardenas, Champoton, Tenosque, Tikal, Ticul, Pital, Frontera, Ardsley, in
roughly that order.
* The EAOS has no planets, but people can live on The Torus and the Residential
Structure.
* The Mutuality also has no planets, and people live on an unknown number of
large space stations.
About aliens...
* The Jinu were encountered first. They are vaguely humanoid and friendly to
humans. They have somewhat more advanced technology than humans. Humanity was
cut off from contact with them during the Outsider War, and they have not been
heard from since.
* The Outsiders were encountered next. They are unfriendly beings with an
insatiable desire to control everything around them.
* The Interstellar Federation of Species is also known, but they have not yet
been seen in the flesh. They are enemies of humans and Jinu.
* The Galactic Egalitarian Alliance of Sentients is one or more unknown alien
species with highly advanced technology. The human alliance called the EAOS was
formed based on text-only communication with the discoverers of The Torus.
* The Children of the Sun are a client species of the Outsiders, often called
Battle Thralls. They are superficially dinosaur-like beings with a strange
crystalline exoskeleton. While many remain committed to fighting humans on the
Outsiders' orders, a sizable faction is negotiating with the human alliances in
the hopes of allying and achieving independence.
* Other unknown alien species are sometimes encountered in deep space, or at
least the evidence of them, but virtually nothing is known of them.
About starships...
* Immediately after the Outsider War, starships were much more poorly designed
than they had been in the past, with all Jinu technology and even much human
technology now lost.
* Starship technology and industrial infrastructure is beginning to recover,
making larger starship models and more advanced technology more common, but much
is still lost, sometimes replaced by cruder alternatives.
* Wormhole jumps are once again quite violent for the people inside, without the
Jinu stabilization technology.
* Chainguns (created by the Mutuality) and plasma minicannons (created by the
EAOS) are new weapons created during the Outsider War.
* A capital ship is considered to be any ship large enough to require a crew;
i.e., larger than a battlecruiser. An individual capital ship tends to be a
well-known name among pilots, as only a small handful of capital ships are
produced per each class. For instance, everyone knows that the Leviathan is one
of the very few juggernaut-class capital ships ever built.
* Juggernauts had crews numbering in the hundreds. Carriers could theoretically
be run with a skeleton crew, but fully crewed would have around a hundred.
Battleships had a crew numbering anywhere from twenty-five to fifty.
* Larger ships generally required Jinu assistance to build. Notable exceptions
include the Renegade-constructed battlecruisers, and some later-model
battleship-sized ships (which tended to be overall inferior to a battlecruiser).
* Juggernauts required Outsider intervention to construct.
About the recent past...
* The Outsider War affected everyone in the past decade, with the vast majority
of humanity's resources once being fed directly to the Outsiders. The Outsiders
succeeded in breaking in the collective spirit of humanity, and nearly everyone
alive feels this to some degree.
* The whereabouts of the great juggernaut "Leviathan," a hero of pre-War battles
against the IFS, are unknown. The ship has acquired an almost mythical status in
the years since the last sighting.
* Several capital ships were constructed by the Coalition prior to its
disbanding. At least one was fully completed and flown in battle, only to be
apparently stolen by unregistered pilots upon the Coalition's abdication.
* Capital ships smaller than carriers, generally classified as battleships, were
produced by the Coalition and the alliances. These ships were universally
warships, as opposed to carriers, which had a more logistical position. Few of
these exist, and none are space worthy.
* Many of these capital ships lacked advanced technology such as subwarp,
improved interdiction subsystems, long range lasers, etc.
* Reconstruction is well underway these days, though there is still much to do.
Experts predict that it will be decades before the collective economy fully
recovers. The Outsider occupation was an apocalyptic event, and its effects will
resound through history even if the Outsiders suddenly vanish right this moment.

Star Conquest Help: Starcharts

In the alliances, starship computers have been pre-loaded with a great deal of
relevant information regarding navigation and known space.  As such, civilian
pilots are taught how to locate a beacon, how to initiate the wormhole drive,
and how to fly manually using the reactionless drive via the starship computer,
but not how to plot a course through the depths of uncharted space.  As the old
adage goes, 'if you need to ask the price, you can't afford it'.
Unregs on the other hand don't have access to pre-loaded beacon information, and
up until the Subjugation of Mankind were likely to be attacked if they got too
near to a beaconed sector.  Since they were mostly paranoid and resources were
scarce, most unregs did what they could to find a small region of space far from
any danger and stayed there - The majority of unregs do not travel great
distances unless there is great need.  As such, while unregs in general have a
greater skill in travelling short distances without the use of pre-programmed
systems or a beacon network, the majority still do not 'explore' as civilian
pilots might think.
However, as time passed and factions arose that gained power, resources and some
modicum of stability, expansion became an option for members of these unreg
factions.  With the ability to roam further from 'home' (without the aid of
beacons) it would become easy to lose your way with nothing to track, especially
since the majority of unreg communities were housed in free-floating space
stations, or with an actively mobile fleet of ships that were not exactly
ISC-approved.
So the unregs looked back in history to the old explorers.  They would draw maps
to chart their way, listing landmarks and distance to allow them to retrace
their steps.  Many unregs (either intentionally or through luck) ended up using
a form of mapping known as large-scale ordnance survey.
In ordnance survey mapping, a location is drawn with corrolary information added
in shorthand using a combination of words, symbols and numbers that may need
further translation if you are not familiar with the particular style of
shorthand used.  From heightmaps to the type of environment to the location of
specific objects, this kind of mapping is highly detailed.  
Starcharts are similar, though of course they require additional extra
information to be useful; star movements and orbital paths of planets within the
span of the map calculated for a set amount of time, likely nebulae expansion or
contraction sizes, gravitational fields, etc.  All of this makes a starchart
less a simple 'drawing' of space and more a mathematical equation in graphical
form that must be 'solved' in order to interpret the three-dimensional
environment (including the temporal aspect) that resides on the two-dimensional
map.
As there are various disparate factions of unregs, starchart creation is not a
unified effort.  Each faction is likely to have their own specific shorthand and
notation, their own focus on what is important and useful to depict on a chart
for their use.  Most starcharts focus exclusively on the regions around the area
of space these factions control or reside in, but some have traded for
information on other locations in space.  
The vast majority of starcharts are usually made of paper or a stronger varient.
 This results in a thick sheaf of said material that can be folded to allow easy
storage either in a container or pocket.  Some of the more esoteric unreg
factions prefer to use thicker material, such as a singular plastic tablet that
has information written in various 'levels' on it, allowing the user to
interpret the information based on its physical location within the material.
Due to the fact that unregs have little access to the advanced technology of the
alliances, children are taught basic navigation via the location of objects in
space from a young age.  As such, an unreg or member of the Mutuality can simply
look out of the window of a space station or starship and if their starchart
covers the area of space, eventually work out where they are.
Since civilian pilots of the League, AEU and Fringe have not spent years being
forced to navigate by the stars, if they are able to learn the esoteric notation
and shorthand for a starchart, they must instead use specialised sensors to
gather the necessary data before being able to work out their location.
However, starcharts are still a rare sight in hands outside of the respective
faction of unregs within the space charted by them.  They are tedious to create,
even by merely copying, and the information contained within will often have
taken a great deal of effort and time to learn, and most factions will be
hesitant to part with even a single chart without a strong level of trust being
built as well as some kind of major compensation for the loss of the chart.

help file.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the

Star Conquest Help: Starcharts
--
In the alliances, starship computers have been pre-loaded with a great deal of
relevant information regarding navigation and known space.  As such, civilian
pilots are taught how to locate a beacon, how to initiate the wormhole drive,
and how to fly manually using the reactionless drive via the starship computer,
but not how to plot a course through the depths of uncharted space.  As the old
adage goes, 'if you need to ask the price, you can't afford it'.
Unregs on the other hand don't have access to pre-loaded beacon information, and
up until the Subjugation of Mankind were likely to be attacked if they got too
near to a beaconed sector.  Since they were mostly paranoid and resources were
scarce, most unregs did what they could to find a small region of space far from
any danger and stayed there - The majority of unregs do not travel great
distances unless there is great need.  As such, while unregs in general have a
greater skill in travelling short distances without the use of pre-programmed
systems or a beacon network, the majority still do not 'explore' as civilian
pilots might think.
However, as time passed and factions arose that gained power, resources and some
modicum of stability, expansion became an option for members of these unreg
factions.  With the ability to roam further from 'home' (without the aid of
beacons) it would become easy to lose your way with nothing to track, especially
since the majority of unreg communities were housed in free-floating space
stations, or with an actively mobile fleet of ships that were not exactly
ISC-approved.
So the unregs looked back in history to the old explorers.  They would draw maps
to chart their way, listing landmarks and distance to allow them to retrace
their steps.  Many unregs (either intentionally or through luck) ended up using
a form of mapping known as large-scale ordnance survey.
In ordnance survey mapping, a location is drawn with corrolary information added
in shorthand using a combination of words, symbols and numbers that may need
further translation if you are not familiar with the particular style of
shorthand used.  From heightmaps to the type of environment to the location of
specific objects, this kind of mapping is highly detailed.  
Starcharts are similar, though of course they require additional extra
information to be useful; star movements and orbital paths of planets within the
span of the map calculated for a set amount of time, likely nebulae expansion or
contraction sizes, gravitational fields, etc.  All of this makes a starchart
less a simple 'drawing' of space and more a mathematical equation in graphical
form that must be 'solved' in order to interpret the three-dimensional
environment (including the temporal aspect) that resides on the two-dimensional
map.
As there are various disparate factions of unregs, starchart creation is not a
unified effort.  Each faction is likely to have their own specific shorthand and
notation, their own focus on what is important and useful to depict on a chart
for their use.  Most starcharts focus exclusively on the regions around the area
of space these factions control or reside in, but some have traded for
information on other locations in space.  
The vast majority of starcharts are usually made of paper or a stronger varient.
 This results in a thick sheaf of said material that can be folded to allow easy
storage either in a container or pocket.  Some of the more esoteric unreg
factions prefer to use thicker material, such as a singular plastic tablet that
has information written in various 'levels' on it, allowing the user to
interpret the information based on its physical location within the material.
Due to the fact that unregs have little access to the advanced technology of the
alliances, children are taught basic navigation via the location of objects in
space from a young age.  As such, an unreg or member of the Mutuality can simply
look out of the window of a space station or starship and if their starchart
covers the area of space, eventually work out where they are.
Since civilian pilots of the League, AEU and Fringe have not spent years being
forced to navigate by the stars, if they are able to learn the esoteric notation
and shorthand for a starchart, they must instead use specialised sensors to
gather the necessary data before being able to work out their location.
However, starcharts are still a rare sight in hands outside of the respective
faction of unregs within the space charted by them.  They are tedious to create,
even by merely copying, and the information contained within will often have
taken a great deal of effort and time to learn, and most factions will be
hesitant to part with even a single chart without a strong level of trust being
built as well as some kind of major compensation for the loss of the chart.

Star Conquest Help: Making Starcharts
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Starcharts are, generally speaking, complex navigation aids that are useful for
many, many years. They are made with careful exploration, long-term
observations, and in the case of distant unreg groups, sometimes even loss of
life. Such charts are extremely precious to those that produce them.
However, modern technology provides new options for those who are able to
understand starchart notation. Using high-quality space-based observatories and
complex cartography mainframes, much of the observation process can be
automated, and the calculations then finalized into a modestly-sized temporary
starchart. These typically do not hold a candle to the real thing, but are
useful enough for the average expedition.
REQUIREMENTS
A few things are required in order to make a starchart:
* Someone who understands starchart notation
* Three observatory space station modules
* At least two hyperwave-capable temporary space stations
* One cartography mainframe space station module
* Time
You are likely used to the idea that, to find an exact unknown point, you need
two known points of observation. These three points form a triangle and all
necessary information can then be derived, a process known as triangulation.
However, this assumes a two-dimensional plane. In three dimensional space, three
points of observation are required.
This is why you need three different observatory modules on three different
temporary space stations. The more they are spread apart, the larger the chart
they can produce. However, one of the observatories can be placed on the same
station as the cartography mainframe, so that you still need only three stations
in total.
THE PROCESS
This, then, is the simplest way to produce a starchart:
1) Deploy a temporary space station with an observatory module and a cartography
mainframe.
2) Travel some distance away. The greater the distance, the larger the final
chart.
3) Deploy another temporary space station, this time with an observatory module
and the ability to hypercast.
4) Transmit a carrier signal to the station containing the mainframe. Signal
strength matters, so consider this when deciding at what distance the stations
should be.
5) Travel some distance away again. Equidistance from both previous stations is
ideal.
6) Deploy another hypercasting temporary space station with an observatory
module.
7) Transmit a carrier signal from this third station to the station containing
the mainframe.
8) Return to the mainframe station and ensure it is getting a strong signal from
both remote observatories.
9) Use the CHART command to begin a calculation.
10) Wait. The longer the stations are allowed to observe, the longer the final
chart will last. The stations do not need to be manned during this time.
11) Return to the mainframe station and end the ongoing calculation.
12) Have a starchart user finalize the calculation. The more proficient the
user, the better the final result.
A FEW TIPS
* Ideally, for a starchart that potentially lasts weeks, the stations should be
able to observe for several days.
* Balance the distance of your stations against your ability to aim a strong
carrier signal at the mainframe.
* An ideal distance is not necessarily a huge one. A good observatory greatly
multiplies the effective observed radius.
* Tailor to your needs. Just need a chart to find home again? That's cheap and
easy. Want to chart a large area for months? That requires the very best
equipment and an expert starchart user.
* The starchart user's proficiency is the largest limiting factor. Good
equipment helps an expert reach their full potential, but it is wasted on an
amateur.

clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from

instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
The starship has arrived on the very limits of a solar system, the first point
where the local star's influence on gravity is anything more than negligible.
The star itself is merely a distant glinting point, indistinguishable from any
of the millions of distant but brighter stars also in view. This is an Oort
cloud, a massive sphere of captured comets, asteroids, and similar interstellar
flotsam.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room of a starship should be a clean, sterile working
environment. This room, however, is filled with command consoles that have
cables visibly snaking across the floor, finding their way through ductwork to
reach deep within the bowels of the ship. The ship is portrayed on several data
displays, with stylised symbols representing specific ship components to aid in
damage level monitoring, system limitation and repair. A small, basic starmap
display is placed on a pivot on the ceiling, but it seems to be an afterthought
as any operator would have to turn around to face it when at a control board
attempting to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room of a starship should be a clean, sterile working
environment. This room, however, is filled with command consoles that have
cables visibly snaking across the floor, finding their way through ductwork to
reach deep within the bowels of the ship. The ship is portrayed on several data
displays, with stylised symbols representing specific ship components to aid in
damage level monitoring, system limitation and repair. A small, basic starmap
display is placed on a pivot on the ceiling, but it seems to be an afterthought
as any operator would have to turn around to face it when at a control board
attempting to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is a soft pouch of fabric with reinforced seams. A pair of straps allows
one to wear it over their shoulders and against their chest. It contains a small
lizard: This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick,
strong back pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours
most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as
somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark
gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run
down its back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the
way of curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is
wearing a slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.
It is open.
Inside it you see a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

Other Stations:
Tom Town Thermal Shielding Energy Reclamation System five golden tael (Tom Town
Station Clarence's Workshop)
Requirements: 900 exploration points.
This addition to your battery will reclaim the heat given off from your power
system, and turn it into additional power as well. The up side to this is that
it may work on smaller exploration-class vessels and allow them to go further
than normal. However, it will take up about 5% of your cargo capacity.
Obviously, this upgrade has not yet been tested to figure out what ships it can
and can't be installed on. It definitely can't be put onto a capsule, since it
has no storage hold. Note: this upgrade requires the currency of Feng Wo taels
in order to be purchased. Ask other pilots for information about these taels, as
well as the location of Tom Town Station.
Solar Panel Hull Plating 50 golden tael (Feng Wo Charging of Stars Utilization)
Requirements: 1250 exploration points.
This addition to your hull plating will give your ship the ability to recharge
wherever there might be some solar luminosity available. The higher the level of
luminosity, the faster you can probably expect your ship to recharge. However,
this method of recharging, like the blast furnace also has a wear level. So,
you'll want to be careful when utilizing it. This upgrade can be pretty much
installed on any ship, including ones with a rift impeller. However, it cannot
be installed on a ship that already has a blast furnace. Note: ask other pilots
about the location of Feng Wo, as it is not reachable by the normal FTL beacon
network. Same goes for the golden tael.
Nouveau Quebec Public Industries Flowmill(tm) Charge Turbine 700,000,000.00
(Nouveau Quebec Starship Upgrades)
Requirements: 1500 exploration points
This upgrade which is provided by Nouveau Quebec allows a ship to spin turbines
in a sense, while it's inside the riftflow to either save charge, or incraese
charge. One of the two. The point is, when this is installed on your ship and
you are inside the riftflow, your charge will increase significantly, depending
on the speed at which your ship is traveling. In other words, the faster you
travel, the more charge your ship holds. This upgrade cannot be installed on
ships that have impellers installed on them by all indications, nor can it
seemingly be installed if you have something like a sensor dampener already
installed on your ship. Ask pilots regarding the location of Nouveau Quebec
station, as it cannot be reached via the normal FTL beacon network.

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life
and round rocks, a glossy black ceramic felo chow bowl, a black upholstered
sofa, a very large and extraordinarily soft black shamak fur, a small blueberry
trash bin, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, an
insulated green cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a red plastic food storage
container, a small blue ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, Kiwi
the little calico CatBot, Ciera the humanoid service robot, Meow the little

This book is not written by myself. We believe it to be written by a version of
Miah Agnello from 
another dimension. Basically, I entered the rift, and shortly thereafter, a
woman who looked and 
sounded remarkably like Annissia Valdaire appeared. She was as shocked to see
myself and a young 
woman named Amelia Turner who was with me, as we were to see her. She dropped a
journal in shock, 
and disappeared. We believe the journal to have been written by this alternate
version of Miah 
Agnello.
The advice and wisdom in this book is sound. I thought it important enough to
re-publish it. I 
wish I had the expertise and experience to have written it myself, but I don't.

STEP ONE::: Exploration is going somewhere no one has been, not somewhere that
has been visited before.
STEP TWO::: Any ship can be an exploration ship if you can make it go the
distance.
STEP THREE: Ensure you know how far you can travel before you get beyond the
'point of no return'.
STEP FOUR:: Everything you experience within the rift is real - never take
anything for granted while in it.
STEP FIVE:: Take people who can work well together and are able to deal with
prolonged forced proximity.
STEP SIX::: Leader, flier, starcharts, records, repairs.
STEP SEVEN: 95% of an expedition will be incredibly boring; Deal with it.
STEP EIGHT: Good luck.

STEP ONE: WHAT IS EXPLORATION?
More than 75% of civilian pilots say they want to explore or be known as
explorers.  That's fine - but they
 aren't.  Not because they don't want to be, but because they don't understand
what being an explorer
 actually means, they never actually do what needs to be done.
* Andrew's Trading Station (and subsequently Lung Wei space)
* The Derelict Structure (known colloquially as the 'Menagerie')
* The Followers of Kumatra (the Levant family)
* The Monks of Xing Wu (places of peace and contemplation)
* Omega V (the lost colony of New Earth)
All of these locations were once unknown (or lost) to the alliances - until
expeditions located or discovered
 each of them.  These expeditions did not head out knowing what they would find
- indeed they knew that there
 was a good chance they would find nothing (and some expeditions have indeed
found nothing).  But the drive
 to succeed and the effort to seek the unknown led each crew to find something
new and gave them the
 opportunity to share it with the alliances.
Who led the second trip to any of these locations?  Who was part of the crew of
the third?  It is unlikely
 you will know, because the initial discovery is what makes the expedition
noteworthy - all trips after the
 first are merely return visits.  Going to a known location is like taking a
trip to another city - it might
 take a while and you might even get lost in the process, but you know where it
is and at least slightly what
 to expect.  The exploring has been done.
This cannot be reiterated enough: Once a place has been discovered, you are not
an explorer if you go there.
If you want to explore, you need to head off into the unknown and see what is
beyond the limits of what the
 alliances acknowledge.
What is exploration?  Going out into the dark and shining a light.  That's all.
So, how do you do that?

STEP TWO: THE RIGHT SHIP
Many, many pilots take the wrong step here and never manage to get any further -
and they don't realise it,
 leaving them to be confused, upset, angry, and ultimately never actually
exploring.
The single most important thing to know and understand about exploration is you
do not need the top of the
 line equipment in order to do it.  Post-Subjugation, the earliest expeditions
went out in transports, in
 scouts, even in carriers.  They didn't have dedicated exploration vessels or
components designed to eke out
 that extra bit of juice or distance.  They took what they had and worked with
it.
You don't need a fully upgraded galleon to explore, just like you don't need the
latest Kodak HSLR to take
 photographs.  A good photographer can take an excellent photograph with even a
Nikkor camera, just as an
 explorer can explore in almost any ship.  The tools allow you to do more with
what you have - but you don't
 need the best in order to succeed.
If you wait, and wait, and wait until you can acquire the best technology
available... then you're not an
 explorer, you're a comfort cruiser - and that's fine. Wanting to travel in
style is a perfectly acceptable
 choice - but it's not the way of the explorer.
Explorers want to push the boundaries.  They don't need comfort, they don't need
everything made easy for
 them, they don't need that last upgrade before it's even possible to
contemplate an expedition.
What's the right ship?  A ship big enough to take the crew you want as far as
you want.  Not the biggest or
 the shinest or the newest, just one that does the bare minimum of what you
need.
Then you decide where to go.  Not to a place you know, of course - somewhere off
the beaten track, somewhere
 people haven't been to, somewhere that on a map would be marked 'here be
dragons'.  Several people from
 previous expeditions have commented that if you want to lead your own, get
everything ready and 'pick a
 direction and go'.

STEP THREE: DETERMINING LIMITS
Of the would-be explorers who manage to actually prepare a ship, many more
falter at this stage.  You have
 the drive to explore, you have a ship to do it in... what next?
You need to know how long your ship can be out before you need to head back. 
You need to be aware of any
 quirks that upgrades may have.  You need to have a plan.  Let's say your ship
has a five day charge.  This
 means that you can strike out in a direction for five days, right?  Not really
- because that just means at
 the end of five days, you'll be stranded five days out from any help.  Whatever
the maximum charge of your
 ship is, your maximum time out is half of it.  A five day max charge means you
can travel for two and a half
 days before you need to turn around - without anything affecting your rate of
travel.
Your atmosphere is limited - too many active, breathing entities will tax even
the strongest of generators
 and will cause problems for your expedition.  Make sure you know how many
people will take your ship into
 the red before you begin.
An explorer pushes the boundaries, yes.  But a good explorer understands how far
they can go safely, and
 won't push their luck too far.
There are of course upgrades that can assist in extending your ship's range -
from solar panels to the blast
 furnace - but as before, these are not mandatory requirements for exploration;
they simply make it easier to
 stay out for longer.

STEP FOUR: THE RIFT
The Fienstein interdimensional rift manipulator and propulsor system is both a
boon and a bane to the
 explorer.  Its benefits are obvious: you can travel faster and further by 'rift
drive' than any standard
 reactionless travel.  Without the phased wormhole linking based on Jinu and
Outsider technology, the rift
 drive is currently the fastest method of travel for humanity.  Its problems are
less clear-cut.  The rift is
 filled with amorphous pockets of unreality, places where physical laws as we
understand them do not apply,
 eddies and currents in energy flows where space itself distends and twists. 
Many of these are the reason
 the rift drive allows a starship to travel so quickly, but only if the 'flow'
heads in the direction you
 want.
Like the ocean-going sailors of old, civilian pilots who travel on the flow of
the rift must learn how to
 navigate its currents and understand its moods.
This guide to exploration is not designed to give you a crash course in rift
travel, but we will mention some
 of the potential dangers.
* Environs:  Entering the interdimensional rift is not for the faint-hearted. 
Bizarre alien ambits,
 time-lost moments, and other strange locales will overwhelm your senses and
seemingly overwrite the fact you
 are on a starship in deep space.  Civilian pilots have a tendency to call them
'hallucinations', possibly as
 a defense mechanism - hallucinations aren't real, after all.  But the things
you experience within the rift
 are very real, they simply don't follow the laws of physics as they exist in
our set of dimensions. 
 Thankfully, most of the riftscapes themselves are benign; simply a temporary
overlaying of another place or
 time on your location - unsettling and often confusing perhaps, but ultimately
of minimal risk as long as
 you do not attempt to explore the riftscape itself beyond the confines of the
ship, which could lead to such
 potential issues as loss of crew.
* Entities: The real danger comes from the bizarre things that exist within,
pass through, or intersect with
 the interdimensional rift.  These are as varied as thought and a full catalogue
of such 'beings' has yet to
 be written, but a few types that have been encountered are mobile snow globes,
autonomous iron chains,
 light-emitting snowflakes and even humanoid entities.  These should not be
thought of as a singular
 collective or things that follow the same path of logic.  The entity known as
'Euclid' is one of the few
 from the rift to emerge from it and successfully (for a given value of
'successfully') communicate with us. 
 Even then, its bizarre method of 'speaking' shows how little it understands our
psychology or reality as we
 know it; even though from our perspective it appears to be benign.  We cannot
assume intent when these
 entities emerge from places with very different physical laws to the ones we
know.  Things harmless to them
 may be devastating to us, and things we consider benign may be deadly to them. 
Remember - if these
 creatures exist within the rift as opposed to merely temporarily passing
through it as we do, then we are
 entering their domain.  Which means that as interlopers, it is our duty to be
cautious.

STEP FIVE: CREW COMPOSITION
What is an expedition without the people who take part in it?  A powered down
ship.
Picking the right people for an expedition is vital - the wrong person in a crew
can ruin morale before
 you've even left comm range, and even a small argument can prematurely end
attempted exploration under bad
 circumstances.
You have a hard limit on the number of people you can even take on your
potential expedition: the number of
 people the ship's atmospheric generators can sustain safely.  DO NOT GO ABOVE
THIS NUMBER.  If you have more
 people who want to come than you can safely take on board?  Be polite, be
apologetic, be harsh, do whatever
 you have to - but make sure you don't overfill your ship.  The more bodies
there are, the harder it is to
 keep the trip running smoothly.  
Remember: you can always take others on future expeditions.  You can't un-take
someone on an expedition that
 failed.
The recent influx of pets has also had an effect on expeditions, with animals
taking up valuable 'airspace'. 
 While pets can certainly boost morale on a long trip, the more animals there
are, the less actual crew can
 join.  As leader of the expedition, you must decide (based on the number of
potential crew versus the number
 of safe bodies for your ship) whether you will even allow pets or other animals
on board for the duration of
 the expedition, or if the crew will need to find caretakers for them.
Set ground rules, but don't end up with a draconian collection of hard rules
that chafe at everyone.  People
 will need to be reminded of rules that are unexpected or unusual, and the more
there are the less likely it
 is that everyone will remember to follow them.
It is likely that the crew will have differing sleep schedules, both
intentionally and unintentionally.  Use
 this to your advantage - if you can, have more than one person able to take on
various necessary roles on
 the ship, and try to have them be split between any 'shifts' that form in the
crew.  If all potential
 navigators are asleep, for example, the ship is not going to be going anywhere
fast or with accuracy.
Remember: Once you're all on board and the ship is in deep space, it's a long
way home.  People need to be
 able to deal with each other without coming to blows or damaging morale, and
need to be able to cope with
 being cooped up in a single small location for a prolonged period of time.

STEP SIX: ROLES
Modern spaceflight only requires a handful of skills in order to successfully
pilot a vessel, but exploration
 adds a few nuances to many elements.
A well-rounded expedition would have crew members able to specialise in the
following roles:
* Captain: Technically this is not a specific 'role', only a title.  The captain
is usually the leader of the
 expedition - they decide on the ultimate goals of the mission, they determine
any course alterations that
 may be needed, they set the rules.  Captaincy can overlap with any other role,
but on larger expeditions it
 is recommended that it be kept a separate role for simplicity and a chain of
command.  It is also
 recommended that the captain own the starship the expedition uses, and this is
usually the case.  However
 there have been notable exceptions.
* Pilot: The person who actually uses the main control board to set the course. 
The pilot is the individual
 who will remain in the control room while the rest of the crew are elsewhere. 
This role is the most
 variable, as the majority of a pilot's time will be to simply watch the control
board and starmap and wait
 for something to occur, so it is a good idea (especially in larger crews) to
have the pilot switch out on a
 regular basis to avoid distraction and allow newer pilots the chance to learn. 
Other members of the crew
 should leave the pilot to work, as control rooms do not have much space and the
more people around the main
 console, the more distracting things can be.
* Navigator: While not absolutely necessary while exploring the unknown, people
who can use starcharts are
 highly useful when attempting to locate a previously-visited location.  If you
are trying to get somewhere
 for a particular leg of your expedition (either before it truly begins or when
you are returning home) then
 a charter is highly advisable as a navigator, as this will make pinpoint
detection of your known
 destinations much simpler.
* Chronicler: It is vital to know both what has occurred within the context of
an expedition so far and what
 is planned.  While on smaller expeditions it is simple for everyone to
communicate easily and to record
 course corrections, places of interest, events that have transpired, etc., on
expeditions with a larger crew
 it is recommended that a single person (per shift, if there are any) record
these things, to ensure
 consistency and clarity of information and that nothing is lost.
* Engineer: In deep space there is always risk, and there is much that can go
wrong.  A rift drive failure or
 a more esoteric issue may occur and require the crew to respond - in a
situation like this there should be
 one person keeping aware of the situation - one voice letting people know the
status of the ship during an
 emergency.  It need not be the same person for every emergency, just for the
duration of one.  In situations
 where crew members must work on the outside of the ship, it is the engineer's
job to ensure everyone is back
 inside before issuing the all-clear to the pilot so the journey may continue
without anyone being left
 behind.
The roles are (usually) context-specific aside from the pilot.  While the pilot
will need to be in the
 control room simply to monitor the ship's movement, the other roles will only
be necessary when something
 occurs to require them; a navigator only in the regular pit stops, the
chronicler only when there is
 something to log, and the engineer only if the starship requires repair.
A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with blue skin and violet shimmering wings
stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working

[Starship "Queen Brynn II"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. An extraordinarily large viewport dominates the entire front of
the room, a thin tracery of webbing revealing the window's built-in
reinforcement. Standing before this massive viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the controls
are arranged for the benefit of a singular pilot, there is enough space in the
rear of the room for others to sit or stand. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a mahogany
coffee table, a large bubbling aquarium containing green and black aquatic life

deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
