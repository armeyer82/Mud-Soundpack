["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a sma

The dome shaped sealing overhead in this massive docking bay has doors that open and close whenever ships arrive or depart the station. The floor is covered in different colored tiles, some are blue, while others are red or white. The walls are painted metallic black, and the room is well-lit. There is a heart in the center surrounding the letter K. The hustle and bustle of people leaving and entering the bay can be heard mingled with the sounds of ships landing or launching. Exits lead off into different directions, leading visitors to the different parts of the station. Rather prominent robotic arms can be seen, transporting ships back and forth from the landing pad to the garage through an enormous sliding door.
You see a holographic gold flashing billboard, a black wooden bench, a glowing corkboard, a cylindrical orange plastic trash can with several compartments in it, and several purple balloons tied to a statue of a white angel here.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central vi

Syntax:
  timer
Description:
  Toggles the ship's internal chronometer on or off. When active, the ship will track how much time has elapsed since the chronometer was activated. This can be useful for timing how long it takes you to vanquish your enemies, for instance.
Example:
>timer
A toothless hillbilly flickers into existence and announces, "Internal chronometer started."
>timer
A toothless hillbilly flickers into existence and announces, "Internal chronometer halted. Total elapsed time: 6 seconds."

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central vi
04:04 deo screen, a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, a bright turquoise cooler, a large sandstone fireplace with a stone harth and a teak mantel, a stack of neatly split logs, an overstuffed turquoise suede sectional sofa accented by plump pillows, a rainbow-colored wicker coffee table, a velvet loveseat, a small turquoise glass end table, Maggie the bot, a purple velvet artifact storage container, a translucent architectural design simulator, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, a red handheld planetary surveyor, and Jenaia the droid here.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
You see an internal stun turret, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, three translucent security drones, a tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp, a velvet-covered teak captain's chair, a velvet-covered teak navigator's chair, a small turquoise wicker waste basket, a shiny gold starship simulator, a small cherry wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central vi

Color Options
--------------------------------------------------
You can access a variety of color options by typing COLOR-OPTIONS. That's color dash options. The following is a detailed account of what the various options mean:
Toggle ANSI Color
 This will enable or disable the ability to see things in color. Note that this requires an ANSI enabled MOO client, such as VMoo or tkMOO-light.
Color Starmap Symbols
 This colors the symbols on the starmap. A red planet has a hostile environment, green is safe, stars are yellow, etc.
Color Room Title
 This will allow you to apply a color to all room titles.
Color Exits
 This option colors the line "You can go north." with whatever color you choose, which allows you to easily differentiate exits from the room's description.
Color General Communications
 This option will allow you to apply a color to the text "[General Communication]"
Color Alliance Communications
 This allows you to color alliance transmissions. "[Commonwealth | Channel 1]" for example.
Color Private Communications
 This option will color the private communication notice "[Private | Albori Sninvel]"
Color Speech
 This option allows you to apply color to anything that is said, making it easy to see when things are said amidst the spam of life.
Color Transmissions
 Unlike the above options, this will color the actual transmission. So if somebody were to transmit "[General Communicaton] Pim Martin transmits, "I like cheese."" you would see [General Communication] in one color and "I like cheese." in another.
Color Damage Report
 When enabled, the damage report will color destroyed components gray, undamaged components green, moderately damaged components yellow, and extremely damaged components red.
Color Flight Control
 This will color the line "A red flight control scanner announces", allowing you to pick flight control transmissions out of the spam.
Color Followers
 This will apply a color to the line that indicates who is following you. This allows you to always be aware when somebody joins your group.
Color Metafrequency Communicators
 This option will color the line "[Frequency 1.0]" in metafrequency communications.
Color Spatial Object Detection Alerts
 This option will color alerts such as "The starship reports the presence of an artifact."
Color Alliances on @who
 This option will display different colors in @who based on alliance. For example, AIE members will show blue, Commonwealth members cyan, and Hale members gray.
Color Newbie Channel
 This option will allow you to apply color to the text "[Newbie]" when a newbie transmission is sent.
Color Camera Output
 This option applies color to the location identifier of internal stun turret cameras. For example, if you have a turret in your airlock and want the text green, it would color the text "[Airlock]". This also applies to battlecruiser ex
05:55 ternal cameras.
Color Organization Channel
 This option will color your private organization channel identifier when a message is transmitted.
Color Short-range Communications
 This option colors the line "[Short-Range Communication]" when you receive such a transmission.

[Heart of Night; Docking Bay]
The dome shaped sealing overhead in this massive docking bay has doors that open and close whenever ships arrive or depart the station. The floor is covered in different colored tiles, some are blue, while others are red or white. The walls are painted metallic black, and the room is well-lit. There is a heart in the center surrounding the letter K. The hustle and bustle of people leaving and entering the bay can be heard mingled with the sounds of ships landing or launching. Exits lead off into different directions, leading visitors to the different parts of the station. Rather prominent robotic arms can be seen, transporting ships back and forth from the landing pad to the garage through an enormous sliding door.
You see a holographic gold flashing billboard, a black wooden bench, a glowing corkboard, a cylindrical orange plastic trash can with several compartments in it, and several purple balloons tied to a statue of a white angel here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, south, and down.

["Fascination" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. A tall hand-painted porcelain pastel gold lamp is casting a warm seashell white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush blue carpet which resembles crashing ocean waves. You see a tapestry depicting jewel toned birds against a multi-colored pastel sky and an enormous rectangular mirror hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the opaque tinted window, you see the ship is at Heart of Night; Docking Bay.
