You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.

22:30 [Newbie] Adam Murray: Is there a channel for tech questions.

22:31 [Newbie] Anthony Danilov: I'm not sure what you mean in terms of a tech channel?

22:31 [Newbie] Adam Murray: My client is acting up.

22:32 [Newbie] Adam Murray: Is there somewhere I can get ooc help?

22:32 [Newbie] Marcus Henderson: Metafrequency 500.0 is the unofficial ooc channel. Maybe try there.

22:32 [Newbie] Aria Hunter: There is a soundpack section on the message boards under ooc.

22:32 [Newbie] Anthony Danilov: Unfortunately, there is not a designated channel for discussing client issues. If you're using one of the soundpacks, there might be a metafrequency channel dedicated to discussion of said soundpack and setup, but not really general client setup. You could try frequency 500.0 however, which is the unofficial OOC channel.

22:33 [Newbie] Anthony Danilov: Or as Aria mentioned above, OOC/Soundpacks in the message boards is also an option.

22:33 [Newbie] Aria Hunter: You could also just start a post in ooc/general and ask your question.

22:33 [Newbie] Adam Murray: Unfortunately it's not a soundpack issue. I can't seem to alt tab to other windows when I have my client running.

22:34 [Newbie] Rothque Torraske: Get a metafrequency and tune it to 500.0. Newbie isn't really the place for this sort of thing.

23:20 ["Starlight Express" Living Quarters 1] (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.
You can go southeast.
