Bathed in bright white lights, this enormous chamber houses the High Guard rearm facility. Most of the facility is cordoned off by warning tape that states only authorized personelle are allowed further into the complex. High on the ceiling are a series of tracks that drones zip to and fro on going up to the garage level and back, delivering bardenium to ships as well as toting bardenium storage boxes. A surly-looking droid in High Guard uniform patrols the shop, clipboard in robotic hands and asks patrons what they need. When it gets all the necessary information, it makes a note on its clipboard and sends a team of drones out. A menu terminal near the doorway displays bardenium costs as well as an interface for people to order their own rearmaments and storage boxes. A tall stone archway in the east wall leads to a proximity weapon store, and two human High Guard officers stand watch to either side of it, hands resting on holstered stun weapons.

01:35 ["Critical Strike" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You can go south and out.

You can go south and out.

01:35 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:35 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

01:35 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

01:35 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:35 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Rolukssica.

01:35 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:35 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:35 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:36 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

01:36 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

01:36 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

01:36 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:36 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

01:36 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:36 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:36 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:36 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:36 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

01:36 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

01:36 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

01:36 You must stand up first.

Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "emily122" reports current location pinpointed at Butterfly Palace.

03:43 Get what?

03:43 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

03:43 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The eight-person gunship "Hellion" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Delta."

03:43 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

03:43 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

03:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hellion, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:43 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The eight-person gunship "Hellion" has launched from Rolukssica.

03:43 The ship is already moving.

03:43 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

03:43 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

03:43 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

03:43 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

03:43 You stand up.

03:43 You don't see that here.

03:43 You sit down on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end.

03:43 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

03:43 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The eight-person gunship "Hellion" has left the sector.

03:43 The computer announces, "A starship and five planets have been detected in the sector."

03:43 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

03:43 You stand up.

03:43 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

03:43 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

03:44 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

03:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

03:44 You sit down on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end.

03:44 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

04:25 [General Communication] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "Alpha!"

04:25 The starship shakes violently around you and a strange shriek is heard as a disarmament pulse impacts the hull and the charge spreads to the weapon arrays.

04:25 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The eight-person gunship "Lancer" has fired at the one-person expediter "Dolphin".
A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.
You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.
From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Flight control in Bellerophon, ooh, nice shot! Er, I mean, I'm seeing some nonconventional weapon activity up here."

04:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

04:25 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

04:25 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

04:25 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

04:25 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The eight-person gunship "Lancer" has landed on the moon Rolukssica.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room.

You can go south and out.

05:28 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

05:28 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

05:28 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

05:29 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

05:29 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

05:29 You begin the launch sequence.

05:29 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

05:29 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

05:29 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

05:29 I don't understand that.

05:29 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

05:29 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

05:29 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

05:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

05:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

05:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

05:29 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

05:29 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room.

11:43 ["Hellion" Control Room] (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.
You see Kitty Mars (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.

12:02 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Outreach Asteroid Mining Outpost; Docking Bay.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.
You see Kitty Mars (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.
You can go south, down, and out.

12:02 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

12:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hellion, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

12:02 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and four space stations have been detected in the sector."
(Outreach; Observation Room) The eight-person gunship "Hellion" has undocked from Outreach Asteroid Mining Outpost.

The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

12:03 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

12:03 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

12:44 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:44 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:44 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:44 You suddenly lose your footing and fall to the ground.

12:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.
(Outreach; Observation Room) The eight-person gunship "Hellion" has left the sector.

12:44 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

12:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:44 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

12:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:44 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

12:44 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:44 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

12:44 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

12:44 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:44 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:44 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

12:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Hellion. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

12:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:44 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:44 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

12:51 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

12:51 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:51 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

12:51 You press a conveniently placed button on the wall.

12:51 A holographic representation of the ship's computer suddenly flickers into existence.

12:51 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:51 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The eight-person gunship "Hellion" has left the sector.

12:51 You press a conveniently placed button on the wall.

12:51 A holographic representation of the ship's computer suddenly vanishes.

12:52 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

12:52 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:52 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

12:52 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:52 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:52 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:52 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

12:52 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Hellion. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

12:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

12:52 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

12:52 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

12:52 I don't understand that.

12:52 I don't understand that.

12:52 I don't understand that.

13:02 ["Hellion" Control Room] (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, and a white trash bin here.
You see Kitty Mars (lying on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.

13:21 You peer out and see...

13:21 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

13:21 For a top, you are wearing a celestial blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a gray armor storage bag, and an asteroid hauling kit.

13:21 You are carrying a droid remote titled "Empanda" in your left hand.

13:39 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:39 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

13:39 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

13:39 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hellion, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:39 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

13:40 The ship is already moving.

13:40 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:40 The computer announces, "The destination specified is beyond the range of the wormhole drive.  Attempting to utilize jumpgate network."

13:40 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:40 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

13:40 The ship is already moving.

13:40 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

13:40 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:40 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:40 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:40 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

13:40 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:40 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

13:40 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:40 The computer announces, "The destination specified is beyond the range of the wormhole drive.  Attempting to utilize jumpgate network."

13:40 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:40 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

13:40 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:40 The computer announces, "Movement aborted."

13:40 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Jumpgate to Sector 19.

13:40 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

13:40 I don't understand that.

13:40 The computer reports the starship is headed for Jumpgate to Sector 19 (2, 9, 7). The computer estimates approximately 32 seconds until arrival at the destination at sublight speeds.

13:41 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

13:41 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

13:41 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

13:41 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

13:41 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

13:41 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The three-person voyager "Syntaxi" has jumped into the sector.

13:41 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

13:41 The computer announces, "A planet, six asteroids, and five space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:42 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 16, 4, 7."

13:42 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:42 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:42 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:42 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:42 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Hellion. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

13:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:42 (Empanda Station; Observation Center) The three-person voyager "Syntaxi" has initiated an intrasector subwarp.

13:42 Space.

13:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

13:42 You peer out and see...

13:42 [Varoshna; Interstellar Shipbuilding Corporation Central Spaceport; Landing Pad]
This austere landing pad is quite enormous, given the general lack of traffic coming to and from the area. Made up of a smooth gray stone, the site extends in a perfect square hundreds of meters across. There are high metal railings surrounding the pad, and beyond them, glimpses of tall pink grasses can be seen. In the distant northwestern corner of the square, there is a small cylindrical stone structure cradled in the angle where the railings meet. A set of sliding metal doors gleam brightly in its front.

15:11 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

Nothing else is known about the Mugatra, but it is capable of interdiction. Field reports have shown that it can emit particles which debilitate relativity drive function and cause sensor interference for hours after the ship is destroyed or has left the area, but further research is required before this can be stated definitively."

This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

15:18 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy.

15:35 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a metallic red starship simulator, and a dark blue suede sofa here.
You can go south and out.

17:34 [Private | Miriam Valleris] You transmit, "Ok."

17:34 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

17:34 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

17:34 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

17:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

17:34 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
(Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has launched from Acrylon.

17:34 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:34 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

17:34 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

17:34 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

17:34 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

17:34 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

17:34 (Acrylon Spaceport; Observation Center) The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has left the sector.

17:34 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

17:34 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

17:35 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

17:35 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

17:35 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

17:35 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

17:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

17:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

17:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

17:35 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

17:35 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

17:35 You peer out and see...

Towering mountains surround and embrace the valley where this landing pad rests, their peaks invisible far above.
