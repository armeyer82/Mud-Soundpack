Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin,
a compact red refrigerator, a pocket-sized purple holovid, a robotic chef named
Nellie, a clear plastic food storage container, a high tech silver star print
holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, an insulated blue cooler, a red
plastic food storage container, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, and a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and
both feet are left uncovered.

This is a large oval chamber made of smooth stone. The stone is mostly black,
though subtle white speckles are visible in the nearly frictionless walls.
Crystals appear to grow naturally from the floor, in addition to a spectacularly
complex, fragile-looking crystal attached to the ceiling. They could almost be
natural, except for the fact that they constantly emit a dim glow. One might
expect a stone chamber to be damp and cold, but in fact it is somehow kept
perfectly comfortable.

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

With a low concrete wall on the west side, this rough desert road spans the
distance between the spaceport to the south and a dark ridge to the north. Above
the ridge the night sky is peppered with stars and draped with a shimmering
curtain-like aurora of brilliant blue, green, and pink. In contrast the lights
of the spaceport just to the south seem small and dim.

Just west of here over the low concrete wall are numerous banks of solar cells
connected to the wall by a thick concrete conduit half-buried in the hard
ground. The conduit meets the wall and then as part of its base, splits to
follow it both south toward the spaceport and north toward the ridge. The ridge
is silhouetted in black against the vibrant, shifting hues of the aurora in the
northern sky. To the east, the hard desert land stretches away to the horizon,
while to the west, past the end of the ridge, are the swells of high dunes pale
in the night's wan light. The spaceport is to the south, seeming small and
insignificant in the vast desert.

pinnacles here is a shadowed niche, large enough to admit a normal-sized human.

New Phoenix's heavy industry was especially hard hit by the bombardment of the
city. Several years ago, factories, research facilities, and industrial parks
populated the area north of here, but it is now closed to the public, and large
signs mounted to high concrete barriers stretching across the north end of the
street warn of various types of deadly hazards. Still, rebuilding is taking
place, evident in the construction of several large warehouses nearby. Among
them is a shiny new store, an elegant sign near the door reading, 'Blazing
Trails.'

Just south of the city's main commercial district, this once thriving industrial
area is coming alive again with the construction of large warehouses and
transfer stations along the wide north-south road. Far to the south you can see
clouds of dust where heavy construction vehicles clear yet more tons of rubble
from the foundations of the factories that form the basis of New Phoenix's
prosperity. On the west side of this portion of road, one new white warehouse is
doing a healthy business, its parking lot filled with its employees' vehicles.
Hanging over the shiny glass door of the warehouse is a sign reading: 'Allied

The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the

Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and
darkened, and the ISC is no more.
A large frame hangs in space here, sufficiently large to at least contain a
battlecruiser-class starship.

[General Communication] Klave Andaran transmits, "What is dampening and ablative
armor?"
Your ship 'Praying Mantis' has been automatically moved into a garage.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Dampening is where the sensors
of the ship you dampen don't work as well, so enimies will have a harder time
hitting vital systems."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Armor is kind of like extra
plating on your hull so shots don't hurt quite so bad."
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Armor is for league ships and
that means they can take more hits. Dampening, makes it harder for others to
hit, your systems."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Ablative armor is an extra
layer of protection for your hull. Both are alliance specialty tech."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And before you ask, although
it's your own alliance and you probably shouldn't have to, Charged shot lets
your ship's weapons do more damage for a short time, before it has to recharge
again."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Kind of like our versions of
charged shot."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, not versions..."
[General Communication] Klave Andaran transmits, "Thanks. I wasn't able to find
details in the Starhip book I have."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Glad we could help."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "The book you have is probably
specific to Fringe so it wouldn't."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No problem. There's only
things accessible to Fringe pilots in that book, and since you can't get sensor
dampening and ablative armor, it wouldn't be in there."
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it
has unread notices.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Our book is specific to AEU,
but it does explain since we can buy the hyperion fighters."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Some other books would>?"
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And I think everyone can buy
those."
[General Communication] Klave Andaran transmits, "The Fringe book also says we
can buy Hyperion Fighters and that is where it mentions the technologies."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "There you go."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The ship books for the other
alliances, yes. But far as I know, they're only sold to the pilots in the
alliance."

Many pilots have approached me with complaints regarding batteries and how they
can know that a battery is good for them. Since a battery is such a vital
component to a ship's functioning at maximum efficiency, I will take the time to
talk about them in detail in this section.
The battery has three things that a pilot should look at. The overall efficiency
is the battery's charge. The higher the overall efficiency is, the greater your
ship charge will be.
Combat grid usage is how much of a battery will be used to recharge a combat
grid. The higher the combat grid usage is, the slower the grid will actually
recharge.
Wormhole drive usage is the amount of charge from a battery the wormhole drive
uses to make a jump point. The higher the wormhole drive usage is, the more
power a ship will use from the ship's batteries. For example, 250% will use
approximately 12 minutes of ship charge to make a wormhole jump.
Finally, we have maximum engine speed. It's not as some people believe, how fast
the ship will go when it's at full speed, but more how fast the ship will start
moving if it has an engine that has the same instantaneous velocity of a
battery's max engine speed. The instantaneous velocity of your ship will be the
instantaneous velocity of the slower component, whether that is the battery or
the engine.

As you look at the engine speeds, note that the AEU actually gets a bonus to
their engine's overall speed. The speed you see written in the statistics above
is the speed that the engine can reach for all of the other alliances that have
access to it, as well as any ships we might buy from corporations. The bonus is
not included until it is installed on an AEU starship that is eligible for it.
Pilots should also note that instant speeds will vary depending on the size of a
ship, even if you have a battery which can manage the engine's instant speed.
You will likely come to see that larger ships will move slower, whereas smaller
ships will move faster.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
