Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Endymion Spaceport; Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole
drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's
chair, and a black leather sofa here.
You can go south and out.

01-58 21 September 2316 GST] From Lily Kaise..............................Since
the platforms of the candidates are rather diverse and everyone has the right to
his or her own political viewpoint, In order to obtain some measure of consensus
amongst the AEU Civilian Pilot Corps, I would prefer to open a vote so that
indifiduals may maintain their own private viewpoint through expressing an
anonymous choice via a vote. Regarding my own preferences, I personally am not
in favor of the Navy becoming involved with Exploration, that it is our
responsibility as Civilian Pilots. In fact, I want to promote a higher emphasis
upon Exploration and that the AEU Government acknowledges by taking a more
active role in providing larger and more advanced Exploration equipped starships
for this purpose. Further, I strongly desire to grow our ranks once again and
would welcome new pilot applicants.
02-08 21 September 2316 GST] From the Liaison.............................Thank
for your statement. We'll pass the relevant part along to NEN. No need to begin
a non-binding resolution
the pilots will be able to make their wishes known in a much more official way
in November. Regarding large exploration starships, these are already available
to the AEU. In fact, according to flight records, you just landed in one!

which sets apart in that we're not dependent upon other alliances technology for

This control room would look less out of place as an old atmospheric fighter
cockpit. The controls are placed so that the pilot can recline and still be able
to reach every control, as well as see out of the rounded viewport. The
nose-mounted turrets extend into the pilot's eyeline, giving the illusion that
one could aim them by eye. There is a small amount of standing room behind the
pilot's controls. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport

marker beacon we've got at the Second Battle site isn't too far from 2169."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Grade 50 is better for

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The oort had grade 40-60, 4-6
pieces per sector...it depends on if you prefer lower grade shipwrecks or higher
grade comets and asteroids."

their smaller pieces, they are more accessible to newer pilots as well as for
the artifacts."

different areas here..."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yeah, there was 134 which was
the shipwrecks, 135 which was the return beacon, and 136 which was set up on the
opposite side."

the one Akemi originally asked about."

136."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

Subject: Ethical Felo Handling
Author: Akemi Bando
Posted: 04:54 21 September 2316 GST
--
While pet felo can make great companion animals, and fancy felo are very pretty
and cute, the reason most civilian pilots keep felo is for the animals'
instinctive ability as vermin hunters, specifically for their natural ability to
clear a starship of the space pest bari. To that end, I want to start a
discussion about how to best utilize felo ethically.
What's it mean to treat a working animal ethically? I think it means you don't
cause it to suffer. You keep it fed, you take care of its medical needs, and
when it is too old to work you give it a good retirement. Police dogs get to
become pets at the end of their carreers. Old hunting dogs typically get to live
out the rest of their lives with their masters without being put to work. Old
ferrets used for rabbiting get to live out their life in the ferret hutch.
Basically, you treat an old working animal like you treat a younger working
animal during its "off duty" time.
I typically have my old felo live out their days in the felo colony, until they
return to the nest of their own volition. They pass away there, and their
corpses are recycled by the nest to become new kittens later. This process is
very clean and there is no smell from it. In the event it's not practical to
allow old felo to remain in the colony (perhaps because of overcrowding, for
instance), I take them to the sanctuary, where they will be allowed to live
comfortably.
I believe that ethical treatment of working animals also means you don't
knowingly put the animal in a situation that it can't handle. The types of felo
morphs that are the best choice for dealing with bari are soldier felo,
sabre-tooth felo, armored felo, and maned felo. Other types of felo vary in
their ability to deal with an infestation, though a lightly infested ship is
easy for any sort of healthy felo to deal with. The larger the infestation and
the more developed the bari in it, the more likely you will need more than just
a couple of felo to deal with it. Sending in too few felo for a hive is a recipe
for wasting time and ending up with injured felo.
Responsibly keeping a social animal like felo also means curating the colony.
Individual felo vary in temperment, and very aggressive felo have been known to
kill other felo. Maned felo are infamous for being very aggressive, but any sort
of felo can be bred for aggression. Felo which are likely to kill their fellows
should be kept isolated or taken to the sanctuary, which is well equipped to
keep them without endangering other animals or people. 
Curation of a colony requires tending to the health of the colony as a whole.
Felo with deleterious or undesirable mutations should be sent to the sanctuary
when they turn up. Every new kitten should be evaluated for aggression, before
they get big enough to be a serious problem. If maned felo begin appearing in a
colony it is a good sign the colony is overcrowded. In that case, some felo
should be sent to the sanctuary.
Balancing the time and monetary commitment involved in keeping felo with your
colony's size is important. Manging a colony of 12 felo, something that can be
maintained indefinitely aboard a tug, should only take you a few minutes each
day. Managing several colonies with a total membership in the low hundreds is a
much bigger commitment.
In the event a felo is badly injured, my practice is to move the felo to a room
with a nest as quickly as I can. If it is mortally injured the creature will
crawl in and pass away. While this is hardly ideal, it is the animal's natural
response to mortal injury. It also ensures the conditions it was exposed to will
encourage the new kittens to take appropriate morphs in response. If the felo is
not mortally injured, I take it to the felo sanctuary. They have vets there who
specialize in felo health.
There are other issues that come up in the course of using felo as working
animals. Notably, the expedition issue. Felo aboard longer expeditions will not
be able to be brought to the sanctuary when undesirable traits appear. The
solution I used the last time I had to deal with aggressive felo on a trip was
to isolate them in a scout docked aboard the expedition vessel. It was not ideal
though, since they were aggressive enough to attack humans and other felo
unprovoked, and strong enough to break my arm on the way home.
I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts on this topic. We should agree about how we
handle our animals, both for the sake of the animals and to make a clear set of
guidelines for responsible people to folllow.
