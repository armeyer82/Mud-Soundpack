01:37:16 Katina Faye dances south.

01:37:17 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:37:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:37:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:37:24 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Katina, mind gunning?"

01:37:31 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I don't mind."

01:37:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:37:34 Which sector did you mean?

01:37:34 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

01:37:38 You peer up...

01:37:38 
[Starship "Firestorm"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a swiveling dark gray leather gunner's chair here.
You can go down.

01:37:39 Katina Faye dances in from the south.

01:37:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:37:40 Katina Faye dances up.

01:37:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:37:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:37:42 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:37:43 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:37:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:37:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:37:47 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:37:50 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:37:51 I see no "beacon" in a leather briefcase.

01:37:56 a decoy beacon launcher

01:37:56 You see that it is loaded with 0 decoy beacons.

01:38:04 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Oops, I forgot to get more beacons."

01:38:13 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I have some."

01:38:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:38:19 You say, "Ok."

01:38:21 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

01:38:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:39:05 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

01:39:12 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yep, glad I'm not one of them."

01:39:14 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:39:17 Via general sector communication, AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There is an active decoy beacon one sector Galactic West."

01:39:19 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heh right?"

01:39:20 The computer reports that the three-person light escort "Buttons" has entered the sector.

01:39:20 The computer reports that the three-person light escort "Buttons" has jumped out of the sector.

12:26:28 From a phone-based holoemitter: The camera pans slowly over a pair of slim-fit midnight blue cargo trousers. Sewn of a midnight blue cotton blend fabric with a bit of stretch, these cargo pants have a slim, body-skimming fit. The slightly dropped waistband and side pockets on the legs add a casual note.

You can go south, up, and out.

12:26:52 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:26:52 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:26:53 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:26:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:26:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:27:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:27:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:27:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:27:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

12:27:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:27:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:27:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:27:34 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

12:27:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:27:45 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:27:45 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

12:27:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:27:50 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:34:28 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

12:35:40 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

12:37:40 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

12:41:28 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

12:41:40 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

13:34:41 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

13:36:26 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The woman smiles. "Good morning. I'm Paloma."

13:36:37 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The woman says, "I'd like to talk to you about an incredible item..."

13:36:40 Shasta the old big onyx soldier felo jumps down from your lap.

13:36:50 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera zooms in as the woman places a pair of azure blue satin pasties with matching bows on a lovely table before her.

13:36:57 You chuckle.

13:37:01 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The woman's hand traces lightly over the item, highlighting its features.

13:37:14 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera pans slowly over a pair of azure blue satin pasties with matching bows. These fancy azure blue satin pasties are tied into shimmering bows. They have an adhesive backing that never sticks too much or too little.

14:48:36 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

18:50:28 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
18:50:28 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a high tech silver star print holovid, a clear plastic food storage container, and Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

18:50:29 There appear to be about 16 pilots recently active.

18:50:34 I don't see that here.

18:52:41 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

19:03:42 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

19:06:42 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

19:07:42 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

19:51:42 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

19:55:42 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

20:06:43 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

20:07:43 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

20:13:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yup."

20:13:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

20:13:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And you have your scout out there?"

20:14:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Stuck? How did you get stuck there?"

20:14:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Can you just drop me off at battle of mir? I am using the starseekers sciout."

20:14:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well lets see, lack of inserters and being dependant on others to move me there."

20:15:10 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Ares at Orion, managed to land as in capsule."

20:15:29 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 22,071,093.75 credits from a xenology submission.

20:15:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I thought Libs had access to inserters by now?"

20:15:57 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Will try when we finish."

20:16:05 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "1."

20:16:19 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "On it."

20:16:24 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Thanks."

20:16:37 You scramble to your feet.

20:16:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:16:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "They cant add them yet since the accelator is still up."

20:16:43 You exit the ship.

20:16:43 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

20:16:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm on my way."

20:16:57 Board what?

20:17:00 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]

20:17:00 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:17:01 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

20:17:02 You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

20:17:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:17:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:17:05 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:17:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:17:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:17:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:17:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:17:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:17:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

20:17:26 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:17:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:17:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:17:29 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

20:17:32 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Kalina.' Welcome to Mir."

20:17:35 This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 5,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do you wish to pay this?

20:17:35 [Enter `yes' or `no']

20:17:37 You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

20:17:37 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,014,848.48 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 777. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

20:17:47 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

20:17:47 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

20:17:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "From my understanding after talking to Johann and Eve, they will be able to add the one that allows scouts for the next stations."

20:17:58 Listen. You need to be careful.

You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

20:22:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yes, I wouldn't be that crazy, I thought trying to get to the station was crazy enough."

20:22:17 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

20:22:36 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, at least you landed safely."

20:22:59 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Indeed, it was either hope my speed got me there, or try to jump out."

20:23:14 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, and before the IFS could do serious damage. 2 hits to the hull is probably end of story."

20:23:22 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Exactly."

20:23:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Which is why I opted not to stand still while I was jumping out."

20:23:48 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "What are you talking about. The capsule is the best combat ship ever."

20:24:08 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles at Nathaniel Owens.

20:24:31 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Should I even respond to that comment, Nathaniel?"

20:24:43 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Of course."

20:25:59 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I actually do think there was one person who managed to shoot down an Ares in a capsule."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

20:45:08 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

21:00:43 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

21:00:43 Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

21:02:43 You begin the launch sequence.

21:02:48 A launch trajectory is located.

21:02:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:02:52 I can't find "couch."

21:02:54 You sit down on a tiger stripe leather sofa.

21:02:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:02:58 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 776. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

21:02:58 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:03:08 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:03:08 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:03:10 The starship has left a unique area of space.

21:03:18 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

21:03:30 You say, "Well, that's better than the trip here."

21:03:37 You say, "Better speed that is."

21:03:50 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

21:03:51 This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air, thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

21:28:42 Your ship 'Kalina' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:31:48 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

21:35:48 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

21:37:20 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

21:52:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:52:56 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:53:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

21:53:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:53:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:53:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:53:11 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

[Starship "Stormbringer"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Stormbringer"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay One.

23:06:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:06:35 The ship's current engine speed is 12000 km/s.

23:06:35 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 7.0 seconds.

23:06:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:06:39 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:06:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:06:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:06:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:06:58 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:06:58 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:07:00 You scramble to your feet.

23:07:00 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:07:00 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The one-person cargo hauler "The Gimbled Ghost" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

23:07:01 You key in a transport of William Dove to your location.

23:07:01 The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:07:02 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

23:07:02 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a high tech silver star print holovid, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
You can go south and out.

23:07:05 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

23:07:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

23:07:10 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:07:30 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:07:36 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:07:38 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

23:07:41 You kiss Lily Kaise.

23:07:42 You kiss Lily Kaise.

23:07:43 You kiss Lily Kaise.

23:07:46 Lily Kaise kisses you.

23:07:47 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

23:07:49 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:07:55 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

23:08:21 Lily Kaise says, "Ugh oops we're on the landing pad. I don't want to be up here while that cargo hauler is here still powered up."

23:08:27 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:08:29 Lily Kaise glides out.

23:08:31 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:08:39 You peer out...

23:08:39 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "The Gimbled Ghost" and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

23:08:42 Not much to see out there.

23:08:44 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:08:46 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

23:08:49 You nod to Lily Kaise.

23:08:49 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:08:52 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"

23:08:53 You say, "That makes sense."

23:08:56 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

23:12:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Who of you can I have available in the conference room as whitnesses, while I determine the result of our vote?"

23:12:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'll be there in a moment."

23:12:57 You scramble to your feet.

23:12:57 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:12:59 You exit the ship.

23:12:59 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

23:12:59 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

23:12:59 The one-person cargo hauler "The Gimbled Ghost" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

23:13:02 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Conference Room]
You see the AEU civilian pilot corps voting machine, the AEU nomination machine, a patriotically painted donations box, and a shiny green trash bin here.
You can go south.

23:13:29 Kim Saunders strides in from the south.

23:13:35 Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

23:13:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Anyone else?"

23:13:43 You smile at Kim Saunders.

23:13:49 "Hi!" Kim Saunders smiles at you.

23:15:14 "Or not...?" You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

23:15:50 Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

23:16:15 Kim Saunders says, "I guess they are not paying attention to their communicators."

23:16:26 You say, "Guess not."

23:16:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am still about 60 sectors away."

23:16:39 You say, "Oh."

23:16:48 Kim Saunders asks, "Wanna wait that long?"

23:16:53 You say, "Sure."

23:17:13 Kim Saunders asks, "Do yu know whether that List Lily sent me was meant to be forwarded as well?"

23:17:28 You say, "I'm not really sure."

23:18:04 You say, "You might try sending her a letter asking her. She checks her mail quite often."

23:18:17 Kim Saunders says, "I'll do that real quick."

23:18:20 Kim Saunders strides south.

23:18:20 You say, "She's really good about getting back via mail."

23:18:27 You hear the sound of numbers being entered into a keypad, followed by the door to the Voice of the Corps's office opening.

23:18:27 You glance around at your surroundings.

23:20:05 Kim Saunders strides in from the south.

23:30:18 Kim Saunders looks thoughtful.

23:32:34 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Conference Room]

23:32:34 This large room is simply but elegantly decorated with pale green carpeting and light gray walls. Deep green ferns in white planters sit in the corners, and on the wall opposite the door is a large silver and green AEU logo, gleaming in the recessed lighting. In the center of the room is a large round table of brushed steel surrounded by ergonomically contoured silver mesh chairs. You see a full color poster of Planetary System 8769-5473 III hanging on a wall. The door is open.
You see the AEU civilian pilot corps voting machine, the AEU nomination machine, a patriotically painted donations box, and a shiny green trash bin here.

23:46:09 Kim Saunders waves to Vernos Bailey.

23:46:13 Vernos Bailey waves.

23:46:13 You wave.

23:46:36 Kim Saunders smiles. "Right, we have 2 whitnesses, and of course the result goes on the message board."

23:46:37 Vernos Bailey says, "Went as fast as the reactionless let me."

23:46:48 You nod.

23:46:53 Kim Saunders nods to Vernos Bailey. "That's all right, you can't go faster even if you wanted to."

23:47:01 Kim Saunders asks, "Ready for this?"

A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Debate.

23:47:55 You say, "Cool."

23:47:58 Kim Saunders nods.

23:48:04 You say, "Was unanimous."

23:48:23 Kim Saunders says, "I will inform the liaison office then."

23:48:28 You nod to Kim Saunders.

23:48:30 You say, "Ok."

23:48:45 Kim Saunders asks, "We have all seen, this?"

23:48:49 Kim Saunders points at a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa".

23:48:49 You say, "Yep."

23:48:53 Vernos Bailey says, "Yes."

23:48:58 You say, "I got the same letter."

23:49:07 You say, "Even kept my copy."

23:49:09 Vernos Bailey says, "It needs to be sent today."

23:49:17 Kim Saunders nods.

23:50:09 Kim writes her signature on a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" where the other signatures already are.

23:50:21 Kim Saunders says, "Should have looked better, you even signed it."

23:50:31 Kim Saunders smiles.

23:50:34 You smile.

23:50:49 You ask, "Need anything else from me?"

23:50:55 Vernos Bailey says, "Alright time to turn these in."

23:50:58 Vernos Bailey pats a large expandable telescoping xenology container lightly.

23:51:08 Kim Saunders says, "The thing is, Lily sent me this list, not sure I should send both that and this at the same time."

23:51:30 Kim Saunders says, "Not sure she intended for me to send it at all, I asked her, and sent a letter because I wasn't getting a response."

23:51:31 Vernos Bailey says, "The upgrade stuff affects us more than the normal citizen though."

23:51:41 You nod to Vernos Bailey.

23:52:12 Kim Saunders nods.

23:52:17 Vernos Bailey says, "Although if we lost access I do believe it would hinder us to be a front line force."

23:52:24 You say, "I agree."

23:52:36 Kim Saunders nods.

23:52:57 Vernos Bailey asks, "Did Eli nominate for Voice?"

23:53:05 Kim Saunders says, "Right, nod 'he did."

23:53:12 Vernos Bailey nods.

23:54:10 Kim Saunders says, "Ok, I will finish this paperwork before I head to bed."

23:54:15 Vernos Bailey makes an important-looking selection on the AEU nomination machine.

23:54:15 You nod to Kim Saunders.

23:54:18 You wave to Kim Saunders.

23:54:20 I don't understand that.
