Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender
silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt
on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval
turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a round metal ball,
Mischief the large black felo, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Subject: Proposed meeting date and time
Author: Voice of the Corps Kim Saunders
Posted: 23:42 20 November 2316 GST
--
Hello,
I propose we will try to organize a meeting on tuesday, November 22nd 2316 at
23:59, or if it's clearer, the start of wednesday November 23rd. I hope this can
match our differing work schedules. If you know in advance you will not be able
to make it, please let me know. I will notify the liaison office of this
proposed time and date tomorrow, just in case Mr. Lambeth might wish to be
present.
Discussion topics are our statement in response to the recent violence
outbreaks, the proposal for medical creche evailability for those who are in
need and can't afford it, and how we would like to see our pilot core develop. I
have a few ideas, but everyone's input is welcome.
If we can't arrange a meeting soon, we will have to push it off for something
like saturday, and run with Lily's suggestion to write a statement based on my
opinion and things you post on the board or send to me, but I rather not take
that option. It will be more valuable if we can all sit down and do this as a
team.
Thank you and have a nice day.
Kim Saunders

[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "If I'm seeing the message 'You seem
unable to shovel anything' when I use the SHOVEL command, does that mean the
furnace is full? It used to just say the furnace was full."

[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It should also say the furnace is full
before hand."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "I just popped into storage to check
to see if the furnace was full. Usually I just try to shovel and it tells me
it's full. This time I tried to shovel and all I got was the 'you can't shovel'
message."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Maybe because it was already full before
you started?"
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "I haven't done anything with the
furnace on this ship in months. It's very possible it's full. As long as that's
all the 'you can't shovel' message means, that's cool, that's what I wanted to
know."
[Newbie Help] Lily Kaise transmits, "It would indicate that it is full no matter
when you attempt to shovel if it is."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Trying to shovel debris into it is
the only way I know of to check if it's full."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That is what it means. I just checked

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sleeveless pastel purple cotton top with a three-button front
and v-neck trimmed with tiny embroidered flowers, a pair of blue stonewashed
denim jeans with a small dark red 'XX' embroidered on the left front pocket, and
a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white
blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the
side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster. Her
head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both
hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

This simple waist-length short-sleeved top has a v-neck and is made of pastel
purple cotton lawn so fine that while it has a crisp, clean look, it also has a
very slight transparent quality. The edges of the collar, hem, front, and
sleeves are decorated with tiny embroidered flowers. The three buttons of the
front end at mid-abdomen with a gently parted inverted v-opening, giving the
garment a breezy look and feel.
It covers both your shoulders, both biceps, chest, back, and abdomen.

[Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello, this is to let you know that, since I
have not received any definite news from people that they can't make it, we will
hold the meeting on tuesday, november 22nd at 23:59, as mentioned earlier on the
board. Main topics for discussion are the recent outbreaks of violence and what
we can do to protest against them, medical creche access for those in need who
can't afford it and how we see the future of this pilot core and what we can do
to improve and change it. If there is time, any other topics can be brought up
as well. Hope you all can make it. I will also inform the liaison office at this
time. [20:59 21 November 2316 GST]

One corner of the room is occupied by several comfortable chairs and decorative

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

#help variable
Command: #variable {variable name} {text to fill variable}

         Variables differ from the %0-99 arguments in the fact that you can
         specify a full word as a variable, and they stay in memory for the
         full session unless they are changed.  They can be saved in the
         coms file, and can be set to different values if you have two or
         more sessions running at the same time.  Variables are global for
         each session and can be accessed by adding a $ before the variable
         name.

Example: #alias {target} {#var target %0}
         #alias {x}      {flame $target}

         The name of a variable must exist of only letters and numbers in
         order to be substituted.  If you do not meet these requirements do
         not panic, simply encapsulate the variable in braces:

Example: #variable {cool website} {http://tintin.sourceforge.net}
         #chat I was on ${cool website} yesterday!.

         Variables can be nested using brackets:

Example: #var hp[self] 34;#var hp[target] 46

         You can see the first nest of a variable using $variable[+1] and the
         last nest using $variable[-1]. Using $variable[-2] will report the
         second last variable, and so on. To show all indices use $variable[].
         To show all values use $variable[%*] or a less generic regex.

Comment: To see the internal index of a variable use &<variable name>

Comment: A non existent nested variable will report itself as 0.

Comment: You can remove a variable with the #unvariable command.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Hyperion; Spaceport Landing Pad.
