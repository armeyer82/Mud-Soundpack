00:00:25 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Don't forget them panties."

00:00:31 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "It's ok Owens. I wouldn't want to worry about you falling asleep on your way here."

00:00:32 Lily Kaise says, "Well let them seriously consider what they are going to send then."

00:00:39 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Yeah, michael would love to see you in them."

00:00:44 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy snickers.

00:00:44 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Just kidding."

00:00:49 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I never do. They have to come off if it's going to be good times."

00:01:00 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Stop putting your thoughts on me jada!"

00:01:08 [General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.

00:01:09 Lily Kaise says, "I'm not much into recapituchulating the news."

00:01:10 "That's what Michael Barnoble said." You nod to Lily Kaise. "Vernos tried to argue with him though."

00:01:11 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Poor Jada."

00:01:12 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "That ain't my thoughts hahah."

00:01:14 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Did you get a second, a third, a fourth to approve?"

00:01:17 Lily Kaise says, "Or however you say that."

00:01:30 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "I think I have three."

00:01:33 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yes but that's why we don't invite you to the better parties. Jadah."

00:01:47 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "On my way then. I can be a fourth."

00:01:50 "That's what Michael Barnoble said." You nod to Lily Kaise. "Vernos tried to argue with him though."

00:01:51 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Oh baby."

00:02:05 Lily Kaise says, "Yep and I agree with the official from Accord."

00:02:16 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "I'm good, I don't do those type of parties anyway, what are they called, the pantie dropping parties?"

00:02:21 [General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.

00:02:22 [General Communication] Jada Nelson giggles.

00:03:25 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "I thought you'd be the main person dropping them."

00:03:27 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Ok better word, I inspect, they call me judge."

00:03:31 [General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.

00:03:37 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Bull."

00:03:39 [General Communication] Jada Nelson giggles.

00:03:43 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I'm sure he's pro and letting them drop."

00:03:47 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Hmm."

00:03:49 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

00:03:50 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "I don't wanna know."

00:04:02 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

00:04:04 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You should. Knowing is half he battle."

00:04:16 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "It's all good, I don't wanna know that."

00:04:23 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, that's a battle I'll pass on."

00:04:28 [General Communication] Joel Kringle whistles.

00:04:56 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I have to maintain my innocence."

00:05:06 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "For how long, is the question."

00:05:12 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Oh dear."

00:05:14 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:05:14 [General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

00:05:28 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I am forever innocent."

00:05:32 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

00:05:36 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Until proven guilty."

00:06:02 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yep and nobody has proven it yet."

00:06:14 [General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.

00:06:15 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Oh, but michael will."

00:06:15 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Key word, yet! Reporters, get on him."

00:06:50 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

00:06:58 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

00:07:03 You smile at Lily Kaise.

00:07:17 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

00:08:55 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Who sprayed me with rats attractant?"

00:09:01 [General Communication] Joel Kringle hums a quiet tune.

00:09:10 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's always Joel's fault."

00:09:19 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "On that we can agree."

00:09:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Me thinks the schoul doth protest too much."

00:09:51 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "However I can probably tentatively approve that idea."

00:09:53 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "It was probably Bovine Boy."

00:09:58 Lily Kaise asks, "Now aht'as new word... attractant?"

00:10:01 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:10:05 You laugh.

00:10:35 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You go message."

00:11:12 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "So beacons. Earth Lounge."

00:11:32 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

00:11:37 Lily Kaise says, "If there were two spots, I'd go."

00:11:40 Lily Kaise grins.

00:15:16 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Beacons."

00:15:37 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:15:37 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Go your beacons."

00:16:48 Lily Kaise says, "Oh ouch it looks as though he may not have enough. Oh well."

00:17:09 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Michael?"

00:17:19 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Yes?"

00:17:28 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Earth Lounge for beacons."

00:17:28 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Don't say yes, it's a trap."

00:17:38 You say, "Aww."

00:17:46 You grin at Lily Kaise.

00:17:48 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Need a few but ok."

00:18:08 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Ali, if peoplw wanted beacons, surely they would have called out in at least one of the three times you''ve called?"

00:18:23 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "He's already in. Shut up and keep sleeping."

00:18:32 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras snores.

00:18:43 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I'm not sleeping."

00:21:32 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

00:28:08 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Congratulations, Lexie."

00:28:14 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "What happen."

00:28:42 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Thanks."

00:56:49 Lily says to you, "Ok."

00:57:01 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:57:09 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ugh I have to gun!"

00:57:12 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:58:22 You say, "Or we can wait till tomorrow. Either way works for me."

01:27:33 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:27:48 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok heading over to old Frontier Love. You ok with that?"

01:27:52 You grin.

01:27:55 You say, "Definitely."

01:27:56 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:28:00 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

01:28:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:28:16 Lily Kaise says, "I should go get some pizzas but we'll get some tomorrow perhaps."

01:28:19 You grin.

01:28:20 You say, "Ok."

01:28:31 Lily Kaise says, "'or do you want some now? Heh let's go get som."

01:28:35 Lily Kaise grins.

01:28:37 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:28:40 You smile.

01:28:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:28:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:28:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:29:04 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:29:04 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Centauri Colony Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:29:05 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Colonial Gate."

01:29:08 Lily Kaise picks up a compact white refrigerator.

01:29:08 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:29:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:29:11 Lily Kaise removes a clear plastic food storage container from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:29:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:29:11 Once a waystation between Old Earth and its newly settled colony, the Colonial Gate station is now largely irrelevant, but still stands guard here as a sort of watchtower.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:29:12 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Centauri Colony Orbit."

01:29:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:29:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:29:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:29:17 The Centauri Colony remains Old Earth's only remaining major extrasolar possession. The planet does not appear to be particularly teeming with life, with the color of the land fading from brownish grasses to grey bedrock.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Centauri in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:29:20 Via general sector communication, Centauri transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to Centauri Colony Orbit!"

01:29:22 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:29:23 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Centauri.

01:29:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:29:31 Lily Kaise asks, "Any preference on pizza?"

01:29:33 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:29:47 You say, "Three-meat."

01:29:50 You grin.

01:29:51 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

01:29:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:29:52 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:29:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:29:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:30:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:30:09 Lily Kaise says, "I generally get one as the Lizie likes that one."

01:30:12 Lily Kaise grins.

01:30:13 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:30:14 You grin.

01:30:15 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:30:17 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

01:30:17 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:30:18 You say, "She and I will share it."

01:30:21 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:30:22 Lily Kaise giggles.

01:30:28 Lily Kaise says, "I'll get a sausage one too."

01:30:30 Lily Kaise glides out.

01:30:33 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:32:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Haha I accidentally tossed out the clear food container."

01:32:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oops."

01:32:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have other options though."

01:38:00 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:38:03 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

01:38:11 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

01:38:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:38:15 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:38:19 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:38:23 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:38:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

01:38:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:38:30 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:38:35 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:38:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:38:44 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:38:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

01:38:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:38:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:38:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:38:52 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:38:52 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

01:38:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:38:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:38:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:39:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:39:02 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

01:39:05 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

01:39:09 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:39:12 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

01:39:15 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:39:56 The ship's current engine speed is 7442 km/s.

01:39:56 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 3.2 seconds.

01:40:00 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:40:00 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:07:48 You grin.

03:08:54 Lily Kaise says, "The league have the best cluster to mine from and we had sure hoped to organize a trip to find a better cluster for AEU but it's obviously not been much of a priority and even though we've had pilots who have contributed generously towards the project, no go."

03:09:41 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, you mean like explore to find a new place?"

03:09:46 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

03:10:05 Constantine Stone says, "Interesting."

03:10:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:10:40 Lily Kaise says, "We probably could do that on our own but we'd need to have a station built as well as the beacon established in the network and all that sort of thing."

03:11:30 Constantine Stone says, "Well I'm almost a veteran station builder."

03:11:36 Lily Kaise grins at Constantine Stone.

03:13:10 Lily Kaise says, "I'll hopefully get that together later today."

03:13:20 Constantine Stone says, "Oh that would be the best."

03:13:39 Lily Kaise says, "I should also get us a Medium transport with a rift drive as well."

03:13:51 Constantine Stone nods.

03:13:54 Lily Kaise says, "Both of you need to help me with shpnames."

03:13:57 Constantine Stone says, "I was thinking about that."

03:13:58 Lily Kaise says, "Ship names."

03:14:14 Constantine Stone says, "But if you didn't want to shell out for the transport, it might be okay. I think with the scout I could have 300 exploration by the end of next week."

03:14:39 Lily says to Constantine, "You will enjoy the points out in 777. It's tedious work but they yield great points."

03:14:48 Constantine Stone smiles.

03:14:50 Lily Kaise says, "From the shipwrecks out there."

03:14:54 Constantine Stone says, "Oh okay."

03:15:11 Constantine Stone says, "Well, may I just go ahead and suggest Spot-billed Pelican."

03:15:41 Lily Kaise grins.

03:15:58 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yes we do love sea and stars-oriented names!"

03:16:06 Constantine Stone says, "Oh okay."

03:16:07 Constantine Stone smiles.

03:16:27 Lily Kaise says, "Some of the shps are a bit odd because I donated some and Shule has and a few I jsut picked random names."

03:16:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:16:35 Constantine Stone says, "I don't have any ships cool enough to name after New Earth birds yet."

03:16:44 Constantine Stone says, "So I've been naming most of mine after Earth birds."

03:16:49 Lily Kaise nods.

03:16:56 You say, "Well, Chemeketa isn a weird name too."

03:17:01 Lily Kaise grins.

03:17:44 Lily Kaise says, "'So what should we name the Scout? I first thought of Star Chaser but heh that's kind of dumb."

03:17:57 Constantine Stone says, "It sounds like a drink they might serve upstairs."

03:18:07 Constantine Stone says, "Which is to say, it sounds good."

03:18:10 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:18:15 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah exactly!"

03:18:35 Lily says to you, "Any ideas?"

03:18:58 You say, "That name makes me think of skirt chaser or something."

03:19:24 Lily Kaise says, "I'd actually like to think of another SEAS sort of name which hsa a double meaning which reflects stars and the universe and that sort of thing."

03:19:43 Lily Kaise says, "Like our Cruiser is Raging Seas which Shule hcose and I love that one."

03:19:54 Constantine Stone says, "Hmm."

03:19:55 Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:20:10 Lily Kaise says, "Our Pulsar is named Ocean of Diamonds."

03:20:19 Constantine Stone says, "Oh cool."

03:20:53 Lily Kaise says, "If we had a big exploration ship, I think that name would be better suited for that but yeah it's ok."

03:21:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:21:34 Constantine Stone says, "I like Astyanax."

03:21:38 Lily Kaise says, "So let me know and in about a day or so I'll go put it together."

03:21:48 Constantine Stone says, "But maybe I'll use that for a ship of my own one day."

03:22:10 Lily Kaise asks, "Hmm is that another bird?"

03:22:10 You say, "I'm terrible when it comes to thinking up ship names."

03:22:51 Constantine Stone says, "Nah, it's from old Earth mythology."

03:22:57 Constantine Stone says, "Which some of my ship names are from."

03:23:02 Lily Kaise nods.

03:23:06 Lily Kaise says, "That's cool."

03:23:23 Constantine Stone says, "My scout is Polutropos."

03:23:31 Constantine Stone says, "Which means far-wandering, or tricky."

03:23:32 Constantine Stone smiles.

03:24:06 Lily Kaise says, "Asteria's name came from well there was this Queen of the stars named Asteria. I love the name of Nissi's Lizard which is Freyja but she took chose that one."

03:24:20 Constantine Stone says, "I like that name."

03:24:24 Constantine Stone says, "Asteria, that is."

03:24:28 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah me too."

03:24:31 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:24:40 Lily Kaise asks, "Want to hold her?"

03:24:43 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Yeah!"

03:25:56 Constantine Stone asks, "Where do they come from?"

03:26:02 You say, "Asteria likes to be with us when we're in combat."

03:26:09 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah she does!"

03:26:11 Lily Kaise says, "Well."

03:26:44 Constantine Stone takes a bite of a slice of sausage and roasted pepper pizza.

03:26:51 Constantine Stone laughs.

03:27:00 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah she sure seems to want to grasp at the controls."

03:32:08 Lily Kaise says, "Anyway I got her on Tom Town which is a station out in Feng Wo Trading Collective."

03:32:16 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

03:34:31 Constantine Stone asks, "Why not?"

03:34:36 Lily Kaise says, "So yes if a group of us don't go out there, we should make our way out there."

03:35:07 Constantine Stone takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.

03:35:47 Lily Kaise says, "Well first, you have to find the optimum starlight and not many areas have that aspect so you'd have to find a planetary system or a star formation and those aren't that common."

03:36:02 Lily Kaise says, "Also they tend to wear."

03:36:15 You nod.

03:36:23 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, that makes sense."

03:36:37 Constantine Stone asks, "You guys went on Nissi's expedition, right? Did her ship use them?"

03:37:50 Constantine Stone asks, "What did you fuel the blast chamber with?"

03:38:08 You say, "Debris."

03:38:14 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

03:38:19 Constantine Stone says, "Interesting."

03:38:24 Lily Kaise says, "Generally youwant to try to get very high grade or good fuel sources suchas hydrogen and such."

03:38:27 You say, "But some debris is better than others."

03:38:34 You say, "For the blast chamber."

03:38:35 Constantine Stone asks, "And is the blast chamber a special feature of the ship she used?"

03:38:40 Constantine Stone asks, "It wasn't a tactical platform, right?"

03:38:44 Lily Kaise says, "No."

03:38:46 You say, "Nope."

03:38:57 Lily Kaise says, "It was an Imperator which is an awesome shp."

03:39:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Constantine Stone's shoulder.

03:39:37 You grin at Lily Kaise. "It is an awesome ship."

03:40:04 Lily Kaise says, "It has a special computerized system which takes up the entire top deck. It's pretty massive but you can use it to plot your course."

03:40:11 You nod.

03:40:17 Constantine Stone says, "Interesting."

03:40:32 Constantine Stone says, "And this is a ship that we can't buy, right? I was talking to Kim and Vernos about this a while back I think."

03:40:42 You say, "Nope, we can't buy it."

03:41:08 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah pretty cool as you don't need to know Starchart notation although initially, someone who has that skil needs to program the starting point."

03:41:26 You say, "I believe it's only available to the League... maybe mutuality, but I don't think so."

03:41:33 Lily Kaise says, "Only the league."

03:41:39 You say, "That's what I thought."

03:41:48 Lily Kaise says, "Mutuality have the Galleon."

03:42:03 You nod.

03:42:05 Constantine Stone says, "I saw a diagram of the galleon when I was out at Demargas, I think."

03:42:11 Constantine Stone says, "It looks really cool."

03:42:14 You say, "That's a cool ship too."

03:42:24 Lily Kaise says, "And different versions of it and they also have explorers and Augmented Explorers and such."

03:42:32 You say, "I like playing with the sails."

03:42:35 You grin.

03:42:40 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I love the Galleon."

03:43:11 Lily Kaise says, "The first trip I ever experienced was on Pierre's Galleon. I think it was pretty new for him too."

03:43:24 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:43:27 Lily Kaise grins.

03:43:28 Constantine Stone takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.

03:44:13 Lily Kaise says, "I was a very new pilot and still trying to grasp so much and he told me so much and I tried to absorb it all but it wasn't easy so I know that I missed a lot."

03:44:29 You grin.

03:44:44 Lily Kaise says, "He is a very smart man."

03:45:00 You nod.

03:46:57 Lily Kaise removes a goblet from a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt.

09:26:46 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

09:26:47 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

09:26:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

09:26:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

09:26:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

09:26:53 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

09:29:06 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

09:29:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

09:29:07 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.
You can go south and out.

09:29:10 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

09:29:12 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

09:29:12 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

09:29:13 You begin the launch sequence.

09:29:15 There appear to be about 13 pilots recently active.

09:29:18 A launch trajectory is located.

09:29:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

09:29:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

09:29:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

09:29:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

09:29:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

09:29:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

09:29:33 The ship is already moving.

09:29:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

09:29:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

09:29:36 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

09:29:37 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

09:29:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

09:29:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

09:29:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

09:29:41 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

09:29:42 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

09:29:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

09:29:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

09:29:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

09:29:46 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

09:29:49 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Or had haha didn't see my payment. I have 4 more. Adding now."

09:29:49 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

09:29:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

09:29:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

09:30:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

09:30:43 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

09:30:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

09:30:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

09:30:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

09:31:04 You pull a large lever towards you.

09:31:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

09:31:37 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

09:32:43 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "Well all gone now heh."

09:43:20 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Due to the fact it can b used for improved, expert and such."

09:43:41 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "But they're not goin' on market quick enough."

09:43:47 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I can never get GMG, so I need this stuff more."

09:44:07 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "What are your colors, Ted?"

09:44:14 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Should I restock the crafting area again?"

09:44:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yes, you're one person I can go with, but we so often miss each other, I'm red and yellow."

09:44:36 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "As am i."

09:44:36 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Oh right."

Thanks for appraising us. I didn't know that it existed as I don't typically review the available funds. I will definitely contribute as this is great for new pilots. I will also inform new pilots as I assume the role of Ground Squad Leader again this next Term. - Lily Kaise

10:46:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi Kim."

10:46:54 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

10:46:54 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

10:46:55 You exit the ship.

10:46:55 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

10:46:57 Board what?

10:47:00 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

10:47:00 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

10:47:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

10:47:01 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.
You can go south and out.

10:47:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

10:47:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

10:47:04 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

10:47:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

10:47:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:47:19 The ship is already moving.

10:47:22 The ship is already moving.

10:47:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

10:47:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

10:47:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:47:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

10:47:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Shule."

10:47:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:47:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:47:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:47:30 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:47:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

10:47:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:47:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:47:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:47:35 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

10:47:37 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

10:47:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Space Market.

10:47:38 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

10:47:41 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

10:48:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

10:48:17 You begin the docking sequence.

10:48:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

10:48:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

10:48:37 You pull a large lever towards you.

10:48:37 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

10:48:38 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

10:48:38 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

10:48:38 You exit the ship.
[Space Market]
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is parked here.
You can go southeast, south, and southwest.

10:58:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

10:58:32 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

10:58:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

10:58:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

10:58:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

10:58:48 You pull a large lever towards you.

10:58:49 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

10:58:52 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

10:58:56 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

10:59:20 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

13:10:41 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

15:46:57 Lily Kaise says, "Exactly."

15:47:53 Lily Kaise says, "New members likely won't be promoted as quickly but since we tend to go off out of comms together i'd like to see someone around who has enough to do what's necessary."

15:47:59 You nod to Lily Kaise.

15:49:23 Lily Kaise says, "He couldn't deplete our funds but he sure could likely try to walk away with our ships or destroy them and such. I honestly am not concerned but just saying it could get ugly with the wrong person."

15:49:34 You nod. "I understand."

15:49:47 Lily Kaise says, "Look what Jonathan Gray did."

15:49:51 You say, "I could see Vernos doing that."

15:49:58 You nod to Lily Kaise.

15:57:02 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

18:04:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sorry."

18:05:18 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
18:05:18 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

18:05:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Lily? You need me to come over to Bikura?"

18:05:56 You scramble to your feet.

18:05:56 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

18:05:57 You exit the ship.

18:05:57 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You see a sanitation drone here.
You can go up.

18:05:59 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

18:05:59 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

18:06:00 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:06:00 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

18:06:19 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

18:06:20 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:06:21 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:06:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:06:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:06:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:06:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:06:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Bikura Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:06:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:06:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Riverway."

18:06:40 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

18:06:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:06:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:06:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:06:45 A bright river of light dominates the view of space here: a tendril of dust lightyears long, illuminated from within by a handful of newborn stars.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:06:46 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Bikura Orbit."

18:06:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:06:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:06:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:06:50 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Bikura in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

18:06:53 Via general sector communication, Bikura transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

18:07:04 Those coordinates are invalid.  The format is: "x, y, z"

18:07:07 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

18:07:08 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Bikura.

18:07:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:07:41 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:07:42 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

18:07:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

18:07:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:07:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:08:02 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:08:03 You scramble to your feet.

18:08:04 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

18:08:13 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:08:13 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

18:08:14 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:08:14 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:08:15 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

18:08:15 You can go out and enter into the ship.

18:08:15 You exit the ship.

19:01:05 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

19:35:24 You laugh.

19:35:33 Lily Kaise says, "Ok so will go fix that."

19:35:35 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

19:35:36 Lily Kaise glides out.

19:35:37 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

19:36:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise has purchased expert salvage sensor for the scout "Sidereal Ever After" on behalf of the organization.

19:37:44 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

19:41:24 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

19:41:26 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

19:41:32 Lily Kaise says, "Ok tha's a bit better."

19:41:52 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't upgrade the manipulator as that's not as critical."

19:43:44 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

19:43:49 Lily Kaise says, "I set the rental to just a mil and the deposit to 5 mil but the destruction fee is 250 mil because we only get back 75 percent at the most and I really haven't setup insurances which I'm not certain I will for more than basic coverage."

19:44:07 You nod to Lily Kaise. "That's fine."

19:44:10 Lily Kaise says, "We can replace ships if they go boom at the moment."

19:48:23 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I can help out with a little cash. But we should be able to get it up so you can use it on a small little nest."

19:48:43 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Just needs a weapon."

19:48:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

19:48:56 [General Communication] Vanessa Winters transmits, "I actually need to sleep here rather soonish, that's why I'm not getting in at the moment."

19:49:05 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "And I can come to you to nab you and the suit up."

19:49:12 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Alright."

19:49:36 Lily Kaise asks, "Did you think of a name for the Scout?"

19:49:43 You say, "Not yet."

19:49:51 Lily Kaise says, "Ah ok."

19:49:53 Lily Kaise grins.

19:52:50 Lily Kaise says, "Will put a sail extender on there at some point but since it will rely upon the rift accelerator, there's not much of a point just yet."

19:54:08 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Why don't you guys land and dock."

19:54:22 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits, "It was not working before, not sure what he was doing."

19:54:27 [General Communication] Kerry Rodriguez laughs.

19:54:34 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Well you have to auth codes set."

19:55:14 Lily Kaise says, "Good point."

19:55:18 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl Orbit is shutting down.

19:55:18 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 48 megacredits from AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station.

19:55:32 Lily Kaise asks, "Let's agree on a 4-digit authcode for our org ships?"

19:56:07 Say to whom?

19:59:26 Lily Kaise glides out.

19:59:27 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

20:01:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Wow the scoop went down. Didn't see the message pop up."

20:01:50 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

20:08:28 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl Orbit is now online!

20:08:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station in Olivia's Pearl Orbit.

20:09:49 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One performance goal down! One to go!"

20:19:59 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

20:20:00 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

20:20:03 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

20:28:12 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm guess I could start something on Old Frontier again heh."

20:31:04 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

20:31:04 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:31:11 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:31:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:31:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:31:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:31:29 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

20:31:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:31:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

20:31:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:31:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:31:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:31:36 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:31:37 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

20:31:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:31:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:31:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:31:42 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:31:43 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

20:31:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:31:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:31:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:31:47 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

20:31:49 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

20:31:50 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

20:31:53 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

20:31:56 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

20:31:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:32:34 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:32:34 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

20:32:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:32:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:32:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:32:51 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

20:32:51 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:32:54 Lily Kaise kisses you.

20:32:58 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

20:33:02 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

20:33:02 Lily Kaise glides out.

20:33:05 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

20:35:19 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Launch."

20:36:35 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "8 mice...."

20:37:15 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oops."

20:43:49 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

20:47:26 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Jacob?"

20:48:19 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Sorry, what's up."

20:48:59 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I can swap it for another suit entirely too."

20:49:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "He can afford to, he has billions."

20:49:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.

20:49:43 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "I'm just following my dearest Ather and his billions."

20:50:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Heh I bet Ather doesn't have as much as I do."

20:50:26 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "League 2."

20:50:35 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "Copy that, switching."

20:51:49 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

20:53:50 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

20:56:29 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

20:56:59 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's unblinking eyes stare into the middle distance.

21:04:57 [General Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Night."

21:05:04 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Night bro."

21:05:04 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Night."

21:05:13 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Hopefully better luck later."

21:05:50 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts close to a large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior, and the creatures appear to merge for a few moments.

21:07:29 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

21:09:50 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One performance goal down! One to go!"

21:11:59 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

21:15:50 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

21:16:50 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

21:17:50 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

21:28:50 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo rubs up against Shule Elemmire's workbench, purring softly.

21:31:50 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
