00:00 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

00:00 #$#soundpack_lag 105

00:00 The starship is already moving.

00:00 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

00:00 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:00 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:00 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:00 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:00 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:00 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:00 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:00 You press a large yellow button.

00:00 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

00:00 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:17 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:17 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

00:17 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

00:17 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

00:17 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

00:17 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

00:17 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

00:17 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:17 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:17 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:17 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:18 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:18 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:18 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

00:18 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

00:37 You peer out and see...

00:37 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.

00:37 Olivia Cantrell prances south.

00:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

00:37 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:38 #$#soundpack_pong

00:38 #$#soundpack_lag 124

00:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

00:38 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

00:38 [Private | Olivia Cantrell] Olivia Cantrell transmits, "Hey friend. I got something oocly to take care of first."

00:38 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

00:38 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

00:38 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

00:38 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

00:38 [Private | Olivia Cantrell] You transmit, "Ok, should we wait then?"

00:38 [Private | Olivia Cantrell] Olivia Cantrell transmits, "yes. if you don't mind?"

00:39 [Private | Olivia Cantrell] You transmit, "ok. Just let me know"

00:39 [Private | Olivia Cantrell] Olivia Cantrell transmits, "I just need maybe 5"

00:39 [Private | Olivia Cantrell] Olivia Cantrell transmits, "Thanks friend. Or just go on and I'll catch up."

00:39 [Private | Olivia Cantrell] You transmit, "Ok."

00:39 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:39 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you and your crew luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:39 [Private | Olivia Cantrell] Olivia Cantrell transmits, "just letting you know my gunning may not be the best first round"

00:39 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:39 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:39 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:39 You press a large yellow button.

00:39 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

00:39 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:39 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 3."

00:39 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:39 [Private | Olivia Cantrell] You transmit, "No worries."

00:39 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:39 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:40 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

Robotics Lab Menu Dumps
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Advanced users may choose to write food robot menus out by hand and import them directly. This document will outline the basic format and attributes that constitute a valid menu. Savvy users may note that this format is identical to what is output in the 'Dump Full Menu' option in the robotics lab. In fact, the best way to edit a menu is to first dump it, make your alterations, and then import from there. Note that the tabs are optional.
  Required Attributes
The majority of menu options are prefixed with an identifier followed by a colon and a value. The majority of these identifier are self-descriptive, but here's a brief rundown anyway:
Menu Header: Header Name (string)
Menu Name: Name of Item in Menu (string)
Type: (Food, Drink, Multislice, Drink Bottle, Drink Mix, Food Spread, Baby Food, Baby Drink)
Object Name: Name of Physical Object (string)
Object Description: String Description (string)
  Optional Properties
Additionally, some menu items may have special properties that can be set. These share the same format of 'Identifier: Value'. Here is a possible rundown of special properties. Note that not all properties apply to all types of foods and drinks.
Bites: Number of bites in a food (integer)
Sips: How many sips in a drink (integer)
Plate: Name of plate (string)
Food: The name of the food item on the plate (stri
04:33 ng)
Container: The name of a drink's container (string)
Spread: The name of a spread (string)
Uses: The number of times a spread can be used (integer)
Alcohol: The alcohol content (string) (Light, Moderate, Heavy, Blood Replaced By Alcohol)
Multi-slices have the following extra options:
Slices: The number of slices that come out of the multi-slice (integer)
Parent: The type that comes out of the multi-slice (Food or Drink)
Slice: The name of the slice that comes out (string)
  Options
If the object has options to choose from, they directly follow the list of attributes. Each option name should be followed by a colon and each option should be on a separate line. For example, a color list:
colors:
red
orange
yellow
  Basic Example
Menu Header: Desserts
Menu Name: Basic Chocolate Cake
Type: Multislice
Object Name: a basic chocolate cake %frosting
Object Description: This is a very basic chocolate sheet cake.
Slice: a slice of chocolate cake with %frosting
Parent: Food
frosting:
    none
    with chocolate frosting
    topped with chocolate whipped cream

14:45 --------------------------------------------------

14:45 Alternative Manual Navigation
--------------------------------------------------
The alternative manual navigation option allows you to use WASD (and friends) to navigate your starship rather than using the numeric keyboard (or number row). This is beneficial to laptop users or those who are more familiar with WASD-style games. The following commands are available:
W: Navigates north. (8)
A: Navigates west. (4)
S: Navigates south. (2)
D: Navigates east. (6)
Q: Navigates northwest. (7)
E: Navigates northeast. (9)
Z: Navigates southwest. (1)
X (or C): Navigates southeast. (3)
R: Navigates up. (+)
F: Navigates down. (-)
V: Maintain current position. (5)
You may notice that some of these options conflict with existing commands. For this reason, the use of alternative manual navigation commands has been made an option that can be enabled or disabled. To make use of them, type SHIP-OPTIONS and choose the option to enable the alternatives. You can still type out the full command name to access it with the option enabled. The list below demonstrates how to enable the option and also access the existing commands:
W: West
A: Act
S: South
D: Down
E: East
R: Raven
You can also disable the option at any time to resume using the shortcut keys. To quickly toggle it on or off, use the ALTNAV command.

15:10 Alternative Manual Navigation
--------------------------------------------------
The alternative manual navigation option allows you to use WASD (and friends) to navigate your starship rather than using the numeric keyboard (or number row). This is beneficial to laptop users or those who are more familiar with WASD-style games. The following commands are available:
W: Navigates north. (8)
A: Navigates west. (4)
S: Navigates south. (2)
D: Navigates east. (6)
Q: Navigates northwest. (7)
E: Navigates northeast. (9)
Z: Navigates southwest. (1)
X (or C): Navigates southeast. (3)
R: Navigates up. (+)
F: Navigates down. (-)
V: Maintain current position. (5)
You may notice that some of these options conflict with existing commands. For this reason, the use of alternative manual navigation commands has been made an option that can be enabled or disabled. To make use of them, type SHIP-OPTIONS and choose the option to enable the alternatives. You can still type out the full command name to access it with the option enabled. The list below demonstrates how to enable the option and also access the existing commands:
W: West
A: Act
S: South
D: Down
E: East
R: Raven
You can also disable the option at any time to resume using the shortcut keys. To quickly toggle it on or off, use the ALTNAV command.

15:11 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go down and out.

15:11 You don't see that here.

15:11 The ship needs to be in space to move.

15:26 ["Starfish" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go down and out.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

16:30 The sounds cease as the cargo transfer is complete.
The computer announces, "Delivery complete. Total delivery time: 3 minutes and 41 seconds."

16:30 You peer out and see...

16:30 [Aerogam Spaceport; Landing Pad]
This small landing pad is rather unremarkable. The area is chaotic with the noise of the starships coming in to land or else launching off the many platforms. There are a number of hatches in the metallic roof allowing access to and from the spaceport, and several enormous windows are set into its gleaming walls. A set of arched double doors leads out to a bald patch of pale brown dirt which gives way to an expanse of tall grass in the distance.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the seven-person expeditioner "Phantasm", the three-person heliogaster "Star Gazer", the three-person heliogaster "Echoes From The Underground", and the four-person roborant "Jade Shadow" landed here.
You see Food the droid here.
You can go north, east, west, up, and out.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

17:10 ["Barracuda" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

A gentle computerized voice announces, "The eight-person gunship "Barracuda" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

19:17 ["Barracuda" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a metallic red starship simulator here.

19:34 ["Barracuda" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a metallic red starship simulator here.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Alpha.
You see Melissa Castillo here.

21:20 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

21:20 You hear a thunk as a salvaging line is deployed into space. You watch as the line slowly winds its way to a piece of debris, projects an energy net around it and begins to slowly make its way back to the ship.

21:22 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

21:22 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

21:22 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

21:22 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

21:22 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Rolukssica.

Subject: Call for Literary Submissions
Sender: Sophie
Date: Tue Feb 13 15:28:36 2364 GST
Reference: 89263   |   Votes: +4 /  0
-------------------------------------------
Have you ever wanted a public forum to display your brilliant collection of recipes? Do you have an interest in writing Miriani-based scientific non-fiction, but don't know how to work it into your character's background? An upcoming building project will require a wide variety of literary selections, and we want to harness the power of the players to stock a library's shelves. Rather than an empty room, we would like to see what the playerbase can come up with to fill the space with interesting and diverse content that players can actually take home and read.
Like a library in the real world, we're looking for books on a number of topics. Your submissions can also include a book cover description and text-based illustrations. Please note that this would be an out of character submission, so please include a pen name, or one will be provided. For those players who have works accepted by the hosts, you will be invited to an exclusive Tradesman event once the submission window closes on May 1st. You may submit works after that date, but the Tradesman cutoff ends on the first.
Some examples of types of books include but are not limited to:
* Miriani-based fiction 
23:21 stories (no actual character names allowed)
* Miriani-based non-fiction such as research books or textbooks
* Poetry books and recipe books
* Children's stories
* Picture books with text-based illustrations
* Self-help books
* Collections of essays or short story anthologies
Submissions will be subject to a variety of rules:
* Must be in character or have no out of character references.
* Must be checked for spelling and grammar.
* Must be completely text-based (no ascii art) and written in English.
* Minimum length must reasonably fill at least ten Miriani book pages. This means that each page should be more than two or three lines long.
* No plagiarizing written content from the real world. That's very uncool.
Submissions should be in a text file format such as .txt, .doc, .docs, .rtf (or something similar). Please e-mail files to
sophie@toastsoft.net
Be sure that your book cover description illustration is at the top of the file if you are including one, and that pages and pictures are written in order. Please use a blank line break to signify the end of each page.
Final approval or rejection will be up to the hosts, and we will make minor edits as needed. Once submitted, the content effectively becomes property of the game and will be modified as necessary. Please note that since it isn't your character submitting the material, it would be against policy to say you authored the book in character.
Please 
23:21 assist with any questions. We look forward to reading your work and seeing how creative everyone can be.
p.s
No, we're not telling you what the project is.

Robotics Lab Menu Dumps
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Advanced users may choose to write food robot menus out by hand and import them directly. This document will outline the basic format and attributes that constitute a valid menu. Savvy users may note that this format is identical to what is output in the 'Dump Full Menu' option in the robotics lab. In fact, the best way to edit a menu is to first dump it, make your alterations, and then import from there. Note that the tabs are optional.
  Required Attributes
The majority of menu options are prefixed with an identifier followed by a colon and a value. The majority of these identifier are self-descriptive, but here's a brief rundown anyway:
Menu Header: Header Name (string)
Menu Name: Name of Item in Menu (string)
Type: (Food, Drink, Multislice, Drink Bottle, Drink Mix, Food Spread, Baby Food, Baby Drink)
Object Name: Name of Physical Object (string)
Object Description: String Description (string)
  Optional Properties
Additionally, some menu items may have special properties that can be set. These share the same format of 'Identifier: Value'. Here is a possible rundown of special properties. Note that not all properties apply to all types of foods and drinks.
Bites: Number of bites in a food (integer)
Sips: How many sips in a drink (integer)
Plate: Name of plate (string)
Food: The name of the food item on the plate (stri
23:43 ng)
Container: The name of a drink's container (string)
Spread: The name of a spread (string)
Uses: The number of times a spread can be used (integer)
Alcohol: The alcohol content (string) (Light, Moderate, Heavy, Blood Replaced By Alcohol)
Multi-slices have the following extra options:
Slices: The number of slices that come out of the multi-slice (integer)
Parent: The type that comes out of the multi-slice (Food or Drink)
Slice: The name of the slice that comes out (string)
  Options
If the object has options to choose from, they directly follow the list of attributes. Each option name should be followed by a colon and each option should be on a separate line. For example, a color list:
colors:
red
orange
yellow
  Basic Example
Menu Header: Desserts
Menu Name: Basic Chocolate Cake
Type: Multislice
Object Name: a basic chocolate cake %frosting
Object Description: This is a very basic chocolate sheet cake.
Slice: a slice of chocolate cake with %frosting
Parent: Food
frosting:
    none
    with chocolate frosting
    topped with chocolate whipped cream
