Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, a small purple trash
bin, and a clear plastic food storage container here.
Lily Kaise is Lying close to you with her arms wrapped tight around you ... with
a sad and pleading espression on her face. Saying between sobs ... 'please don't
go .... please don't leave me ... you are the love of my life ... please don't
go!'.

Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

hidden inside the endless webbing.

quickly evaporating smoke.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been

clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

the center.

it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
Rogue Romano asks, "Oh, we're actually travellin' in the direction towards
farport?"

[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Forward Observation]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a white leather
sofa with a dark purple throw pillow and a black throw pillow on it, a maple
coffee table, a silver projector, a small fragrant cone of incense, Tegan the
small circular sanitation bot, an ancient moss-covered tree stump, an emerald
green ice cream dispenser, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, a
large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a
shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, a silky indigo cushion decorated with
embroidered silver stars, a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor
pillow, a soft square brown floor cushion, a large white and strawberry red
paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a bulky silver-colored
posterizer, a medium aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and
round rocks, a gray plastic box labeled 'Fun!', and a magician's top hat here.

The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles
abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the
glass, then it withdraws.

A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
