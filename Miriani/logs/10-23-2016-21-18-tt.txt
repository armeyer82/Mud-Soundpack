Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

From a high tech silver star print holovid: A shot of a busy cafe appears. It is
filled with a sea of primates, all screaming and hooting and flinging syrupy
waffles and pounding their fists on tables.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An announcer shouts at the top of
his lungs, "BIG HARRY'S MONKEY WAFFLE HOUSE!!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A pair of chimpanzees get into a
fight, rolling around on a table, their fur matted with syrup and dusted with
powdered sugar. A pair of orangutans hang onto a ceiling fan, screaming as it
swings them around wildly.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An announcer shouts at the top of
his lungs, "BIG HARRY'S MONKEY WAFFLE HOUSE!!!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A gorilla grabs a chair and hurls it
through a plate glass window. It beats its chest as a family of bonobos hop up
and down on plates of waffles, hooting and shrieking.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An announcer shouts at the top of
his lungs, "BIG HARRY'S MONKEY WAFFLE HOUSE!!!! WE DELIVER ANYWHERE! CALL
0300-62224!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The shot fades as the cacophony
continues to escalate, the sound cutting off abruptly.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ball is rolled, and the boy
kicks with all his might, sending the ball careening through the foreground.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera quickly pans, following
the ball.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ball strikes a roving Outsider
enforcer drone.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The drone slowly turns on its
tentacles, revealing that white greasepaint has been applied near its eyeband,
as well as a large red rubber nose.

You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The drone begins trundling towards
the child.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The children scream and disperse.
Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: As the frail child runs, a leg
suddenly sticks out in front of him, sending him to the ground.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A man dressed in a clown costume
emerges from the shadows and watches as the drone closes in on the child.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The child screams pitifully as he is
repeatedly struck by the drone's stun tentacles.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A grave voice intones, "Turbulence
HV is wholesome children's programming. Stay tuned, kids! Ha. Ha. ...Ha..."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Next on...The Koller Channel... is
Turbulence: Nature Documentary. Stay tuned. Or else.

From a high tech silver star print holovid: Soothing music plays as two felo
frolick in a meadow.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: One of the felo leaps up, perhaps
playfully, at a Velourian sparklehawk flying low to the ground.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
Lily Kaise flips a high tech silver star print holovid to ISNN.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays to the image of
a generic-looking planet spinning around. "And now, the Interstellar Politics
Hour! Now condensed into one minute by popular demand!"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "There we go."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades quickly, then
displays a newscaster seated at a desk.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Good evening. Our topic for
tonight... Last night's debate, where the candidates were questioned about their
space policy and given a chance to clearly outline their differing positions.
The first such question had to do with the AEU's civilian pilot program."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image of President Warren Garner
appears. He says, "It's clear that the civilian pilot program has suffered from
a lack of discipline and leadership. Perhaps we asked too much of civilians, who
do not have the benefit of the intensive training our military receive.
Regardless, it's clear that the actions of the civilian corps, from engaging in
human trafficking to embarrassing us before the Mutuality Council to indulging
in conspiracies about deep space cults, leave us with little choice but to
continue the gradual cessation of the civilian program. Our gap in expeditions
will be made up by a well-equipped, well-trained branch of the navy."
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "Stick it wehre the sun does not
shine Garner!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image changes to show Eric Best.
He shakes his head, then gestures animatedly as he says, "It's all nonsense. The
only problems our civilians have faced is being too worried about what others
think of us. Who cares what the Mutuality or the League think of us? We must
make progress on our own terms. And one thing is clear, the civilian pilot
program has always had tremendous success in bringing in new resources and
creating new wealth, something no branch of the navy is able to match. This idea
of eliminating our civilian pilots is terrible."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been
received at AEU Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Angel's Flight". The organization has
earned 401,300.95 credits.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image changes to that of Kaisa
Rebane. "These answers are both extremes. I see no reason why the civilian pilot
program can't continue in much the same way as it is now. Yes, there have been
many unfortunate incidents, and we will have to take care and look closely at
the program before deciding whether to open it to new applicants again. And,
yes, the pilots we have now would certainly need to begin showing some
leadership. But Mr. Best is right, the program brings in incredible wealth, and
its continuation is essential to the health of the economy until a suitable
private sector equivalent emerges."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades into that of the
newscaster once again, who remarks, "The moderator then raised the issue of
relations with the Mutuality, which still have yet to be normalized, which
resulted in a fiery exchange."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: President Garner says, "We should
strive to have good relationships with all of our neighbors, and the Mutuality
certainly qualify, in travel time if not in distance. Perhaps when the civilian
pilot program is discontinued, we can convince them to engage with our state
department rather than the civilian corps, and our diplomats can work on
rebuilding that relationship."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Mr. Best shakes his head. "Waste of
time. Look, they want nothing to do with us, so why waste time bowing and
scraping to them? We put our tax money into the Accord, tax money that gets
spent on defending Mutuality space, sending rift probes with classified
technology to bizarre cult societies, and even repairing space stations
belonging to a completely different species. What do we get out of that? What
have they given us? No more. We need to look to our own borders. If we empower
our civilian program and our navy, with MILITARY technology, then we'll do
great. Things are very bad right now, but we can do great."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Ms. Rebane responds, "I agree with
Mr. Best that we need to spend our tax money more wisely. Spending less on the
Accord initiative would allow for tax cuts across the board, kicking our economy
back into high gear and giving us the funding we need to subsidize private
sector solutions for bringing in new resources. This so-called Expeditionary
Force would be an expensive boondoggle. But I have to disagree with this blind
empowerment of the civilian corps. A measured, considered approach is best, and
in time, again, I would like to see that program transition to a private
initiative, out of the hands of the government."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster smiles tightly as she
reappears on the screen. "A stark choice stands before the AEU in regards to its
space program as well as many other issues. Election Day is on Tuesday, November
1st, less than two weeks away, and the polls are still tight!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "That's all we have time for today.
This has been the Interstellar Politics Hour, only on ISNN!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays as the camera
slowly zooms away from the newscaster, who smiles stiffly.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays to the image of
a generic-looking planet spinning around. "And now, the Interstellar Politics
Hour! Now condensed into one minute by popular demand!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades quickly, then
displays a newscaster seated at a desk.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Good evening. Our topic for
tonight... The upcoming AEU presidential election! The conventions are done and
the parties have picked their candidates and platforms. Let's take a look at the
choice AEU citizens will have this November."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Do you want to see it again?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An image of a determined-looking
older woman appears.
'Nope, that was the second time I've seen it.
You say, "Nope, that was the second time I've seen it."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The candidate for the New Republic
party is Kaisa Rebane. The party of ousted President Sheffield has found itself
shunned by foreign governments, and seems ready to respond in kind, with a
largely domestic platform focused on economic reform via tax relief and
subsidies for job-creating corporations."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok will watch this part."
[General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau
Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth
minutes!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image transitions to show a
middle-aged man.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Predictably, President Warren
Garner of the Green Earth party is up for another term. His promises for the
next term include expanding access to advanced medical care, providing free
tuition to university students, and creating a space exploration arm of the AEU
Navy to correct the 'expedition gap' left in the wake of the closing of the
civilian pilot program."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image transitions once more to
show a confident younger man.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Last but not least is Eric Best of
the National Patriots party. Mr. Best has recently been the voice of a populist
outcry against what his supporters see as harmful foreign influences,
controversially classifying events like diplomatic appeasements of the Mutuality
Council and the shutdown of the civilian pilot program as 'weak-willed
kowtowing' that he promises not to continue."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster smiles into the
camera. "Right now, the election is too close to call, but we'll be with you
with the latest polls and election news till the end!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "And that's all we have time for
today. This has been the Interstellar Politics Hour, only on ISNN!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays as the camera
slowly zooms away from the newscaster, who smiles stiffly.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays to the image of
a galaxy of stars swirling around rapidly. "Around the galaxy and into your
home... it's the Space News Break on ISNN! Dateline: 26 January 2316."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The scene cuts abruptly to show a
well-groomed newscaster seated at a desk. He places his palms flat upon the desk
before him.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Our top story tonight: The League
government declares that the Krupin Report is an elaborate hoax motivated by a
desire for revenge!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An image appears of an Explorer
starship model, though this one has been heavily modified from the classic
design.
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps
its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "A few days ago, we reported on the
the expeditionary starship 'Metal Heart' and its jettisoning of two AEU pilots
whose careers are both just a few weeks old, Tatiana Krupin and Syona Vera. Both
pilots stand behind an account of an experienced crew gone suddenly mad, or at
least behaving irrationally. Most of this is fueled by what's become known as
the Krupin Report, a document authored by Ms. Krupin and originally sent to the
AEU government, describing rift oddities driving the crew insane and alluding to
pirate sympathies."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster shakes his head
slowly. "At the time, we had only speculation. Though the Accord had already
deemed the report specious, there was always the possibility that they were
trusting the word of the wrong party. What if the crew really HAD gone mad? Or,
even worse, gone rogue and defected to a pirate group, as Nils Aristov did not
too long ago?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Unable to quash these rumors about
five of their pilots, including their most decorated ace pilot, the League
launched its own independent investigation into these allegations earlier today.
The League government had access to one piece of evidence in particular:
magnetic tape backups of the black box belonging to the escape pod that Ms.
Krupin and Ms. Vera were sent home in."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An image appears over the
newscaster's shoulder of a Masterson High Redundancy Escape Pod.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Though the Metal Heart is a
Mutuality ship, the escape pod used was that of a League module scout which
Metal Heart was carrying. Each escape and rescue pod carries a black box, which
records telemetry and audio to assist with any postmortem of a starship's
destruction or abandonment. Since these pods almost always ensure the crew's
survival, the black boxes are hardly ever accessed, since the crew's own account
is more readily available and leaves fewer questions."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster smiles grimly. "But
not this time. What you are about to hear is audio recorded on the module
scout's escape pod, what investigators have determined to be a conversation
between Ms. Krupin and Ms. Vera while on their way back home. Be warned that
this audio contains strong language that some viewers may find offensive."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image of the newscaster fades to
black. Subtitles in white text appear as recorded audio plays.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Syona Vera: I didn't accuse anyone
of anything. There was a misunderstanding, and I explained why I misunderstood,
and that was that. If they were going to be cunts and pod me, they should've
done it then."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Tatiana Krupin: I'm not
particularly fond of the situation, either."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Tatiana Krupin: They all went
batshit insane. I'm going to recommend they be quarantined and held for psych
evaluations. I think the stone and rift food did something."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster says via voiceover,
"Our source reports that the investigators nearly requested the immediate recall
of the Metal Heart at this point, but first, they let the recording play on.
Let's listen."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Tatiana Krupin: Are you really
denying you said it? You said it to me, and I watched you say it to Pierre."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Syona Vera: Said what?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Tatiana Krupin: That the Mutuality
wanted to let the slavers go. So you didn't say that? After I told you not to?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Syona Vera: How stupid do you think
I am?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Tatiana Krupin: Considering you
said it to Pierre, it would not be without precedent."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster says via voiceover,
"This, investigators say, directly contradicts the Krupin Report, in which Ms.
Krupin states clearly that she believes Ms. Vera never made these remarks. But
there is still more."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Syona Vera: I hope they get blown
up by pirates. It'd show them 'culture.'"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Tatiana Krupin: Well. Quarantine is
the next best thing."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Tatiana Krupin: Failing that, I
have another plan that would probably get me executed if caught and is so
vindictive and petty that it will be part of legend."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "..."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Tatiana Krupin: So instead of
lashing out at me, who didn't do anything to you, why are we not considering
revenge?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster says via voiceover,
"According to the League investigators, this exchange reveals the true purpose
of the Krupin Report. Then, they say, the two began to work on getting their
story straight."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Syona Vera: If anything this is
evidence of them working for pirates, and they should be investigated for it."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Tatiana Krupin: Hence my suggestion
regarding psych evals."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster looks up as the image
of the text fades. "Shortly after the recording of this audio and the landing of
the escape pod, Ms. Krupin filed her report describing the irrational behavior
of the crew, alluded to pirate sympathies, and called for them to be placed into

"With this promise of vengeance ringing in the investigators' ears, they have

rather than any legitimate concerns of the two jettisoned crew and that the
serious accusations contained within have no merit. At this late hour, the
League government is vehemently condemning Ms. Krupin for ever filing the
report, as well as the AEU government for lending it any merit."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The League government is also
calling for psychiatric evaluations of Ms. Krupin and Ms. Vera, citing what they
call the AEU's 'recent failures' in this regard."

From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Good evening. Our topic for
tonight... Last night's debate, where the candidates were questioned about their
space policy and given a chance to clearly outline their differing positions.
The first such question had to do with the AEU's civilian pilot program."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image of President Warren Garner
appears. He says, "It's clear that the civilian pilot program has suffered from
a lack of discipline and leadership. Perhaps we asked too much of civilians, who
do not have the benefit of the intensive training our military receive.
Regardless, it's clear that the actions of the civilian corps, from engaging in
human trafficking to embarrassing us before the Mutuality Council to indulging
in conspiracies about deep space cults, leave us with little choice but to
continue the gradual cessation of the civilian program. Our gap in expeditions
will be made up by a well-equipped, well-trained branch of the navy."

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Points beyond which your hull won't be

[Newbie Help] Klave Andaran transmits, "Sorry, I think that was a little too
dense (as in a lot of information compacted into a very small statement) for me
to take in."
[Newbie Help] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "If you get shot and it hits your
hull, it does a maximum of the failsafe in damage."
[Newbie Help] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Essentially, your ship takes a
guaranteed number of hits to the hull to explode."
[Newbie Help] Jonathon Glythmon transmits, "The hull can not exceed 100%. The
failsafe is a mark of how far you can get before dangerous limits are reached.
The more damage the hull takes, closer, even breaking that failsafe gives you
incentive to run the hekc away."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Think of the failsafe as a cap. If your
hull has 100 damage points, and a 100 damage shot hits you, you would expect the
ship to just blow up. But if you have a failsafe at 95% for instance, then you
will only take up to that failsafe. You'll still have 5 damage points on your
hull left."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Of course if a second shot hits you'll
lose the ship, but the failsafe did its job before it was destroyed. You'll have
a chance to escape, maybe."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Hi."
[Newbie Help] Klave Andaran transmits, "I think I am getting it. If failsafes
are at 65% and my armor is at 85% I can be sure that the next hit to my hull, no
matter how powerfull, will not destroy my ship. Once I dip beliw 65% I am in
grave risk. Sound right?"
[Newbie Help] Klave Andaran transmits, "Alright I get it now. Thanks!"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "You are certainly in the ballpark. Just as
a note, there's an ablative armor module some ships have which is listed in the
damage reports as Armor. That's not the same thing as the hull damage, and
doesn't interact with failsafes the way the hull damage does."
[Newbie Help] Klave Andaran transmits, "Alright. I'll keep that in mind!"

Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.
I'm sorry I didn't reply sooner. I am willing to craft the battle recharge, 
battle restoration, energy dump, quick patch, basic damage boost and improved

Thanks.

Eve,
I'm sorry I didn't reply sooner. I am willing to craft the battle recharge, 
battle restoration, energy dump, quick patch, basic damage boost and improved
damage boost for you. That will come to a total of 60 mill. I have to go back to
sleep for a little while but I will be back this evening and craft them for you.
Thanks.

supposed to go down soonish."

straight away. Thanks."

as guard for you if you want."

I'm not in the mood to get shot at."

points from the BAS?"

All the parts have been gathered, so it won't take long."

[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "All the points."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Definitely!"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You're very welcome. I like
to help."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "He's a nice Emperor. We ought to
visit him sometime, maybe."

[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah that would be grand!"
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The Salvaging Station to replace
the one in 285 is put together in my constructor and will be deployed around
midnight when the current one goes offline."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Okay, we have a slight
problem. The battery Mel asked me to get appears to be the wrong one."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Lucky I checked."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oops what battery do you have?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's the large precharged
battery. 100 power. It appears I need the one that will support 150."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah that is the fission breeder
reactor."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "For the BAS? We use a fission
reactor usually. Practically the only thing that will accomodate the top-end
scanner besides the fusion chambers."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Was that part provided by
cats?"
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Look on Starseekers Spar Parts."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hmmm, I'm sure I didn't see
one on seekers ship."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok Cats can buy one perhaps?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm double checking in case
I missed it."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah that part is typically from
Starseekers but I don't see anyone available from them."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nope, only the batteries
here."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ugh."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Is it critical to keep
continuity?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If it can wait a little while,
you can probably catch Kim in a matter of hours at most."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's probably why I
grabbed the battery when I was putting things together the other day. Sorry
about this confusion guys."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Someone or other will bitch
about the BAS being down if we do that."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well not always but just means
Starseekers is left out and that's unfortunate and yes I'd say wait a bit. Just
means no BAS supported beacons for a bit but that's not that terrible."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Let them bitch."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "A few hours won't hurt
anything."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "I tend to agree. I don't want
to screw over Kim just because Mel and Eve made an easy mistake."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's just it. Mel told me
the parts would be here. I grabbed the battery, forgetting to double check the
power. So, shall we wait, then?"
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "That being said, anyone up
for some last minute bas-supported beacons?"
[Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sure!"
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Yeah, I'd wait to see if Kim
comes around later."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Or Angel or others."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sure thing. If anyone spots
her and I don't, can you poke her, please?"

part for seekers, please?"

breeders on Spare Parts?"
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Oh sure!"
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Okay. Let's wait for this
station stuff to get sorted out, then I'll run beacons."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks. We didn't wanna miss
y'all out on the BAS."
[Tactical Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "I'm in for beacons whenever."
[Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good plan!"
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Of course. Thank you for
thinking of us."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Of course."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll make sure to put the
other battery back on the spares ship when this is done."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Alrighty. No problem. I'll put
some on there in just a few. Just need to go there."
[Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'd be up for beacons as
well if there's still a spot."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sure, I'm on the dock
waiting."

out, and if everybody shows up, we can still use one more for gunships. Two for
the pincer."

[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Oh."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Well maybe an Ares will come
along I can fight or something."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Just ask Eric Best to predict a
pirate attack on you, specifically."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sorry Lillian. I should have
double checked this earlier."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "He's good at predicting them."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson laughs.
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "It's fine. I was just
wandering around before this anyway."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's the first time I've had
to get everything together for a station myself, so it just didn't register to
check."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "It happens. No worries."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Once I forgot a station core for
a station I was setting up that was 150 light-years out."
[General Communication] Klaus Stein transmits, "Ouch."
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Oh my."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I'm coming, eve. Just... give
me a second."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh hell, seriously? I would
have been fuming with myself."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Klaus! Klaus did you install
that shell yet?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's cool. I'm not rushing
ya."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Well Eve, it was annoying, but
it wasn't a disaster or anything. Just annoying."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "What really hurt was having to
make two more trips out to it, to adjust the way the hypercaster was aimed."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches out.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah, that would have
irritated me. Then again, we had to abort a four hour trip to the bubble,
because we forgot to pick up a part."
[General Communication] Klaus Stein transmits, "No akemi, to answer your
question, Morning Star doesn't quite meet the requirements for the lab. We're
not far off though."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We got like, an hour into it
before we realized."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Will be ashile for Seas as well
but we're mostly going t to be lacking the Command points for awhile."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Morning Star is likely the
closest of the orgs that got shells out of that trip. Keep working at the
command points."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Awhile that is."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep because they've been in
business longer."
[General Communication] Klaus Stein transmits, "We have the command and combat,
just need about another 500 industry and exploration."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Oh, geeze, that's easy Klaus."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I am really hoping someone gets
the glowing nodules plant trait."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah that will be interesting."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "We could hybridize it with the
other charge trait that Cats has, and get a plant that really boosts charge."

[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, I am here."
Jewel the large violet glowing felo wanders out.
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Does anybody have a black pods
plant?"
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Sorry orange pods."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Kim, you guys were out of
the powerplants I need for the BAS on your spares ship. I'm waiting on Angel to
come put some on there for me."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Yep. I'm coming."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I've not heard of a plant with
orange pods before, Johann."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "You got one like that?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I know, I was just letting
Kim know."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "No idea what it does?"
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Not yet. I'll be able to get a
cutting in a day or so."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Neat."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Maybe it'll be the other
trickle-charge plant or something."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Nah, our trickle charge is
black pods."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Mmm, knew plants, I like
this."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "I think that's a new one as
well."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Maybe it'll be a plant that
increases rift sail speed."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Wouldn't that be nice?"
[General Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "I've been looking for one of
those."
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Always looking!"
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Or a life support plant."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Is life support a big problem?
Just bring fewer people."

crowds."

[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm yes probably on his ships let
me come over and put one out for you."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks. I figure I'll try
and get everyone in on this if I can, now that there's slightly more time since
the BAS dropped."

Shule,
I really appreciate this.
If it wouldn't be too much trouble, could you please add in two extra energy
dumps, since most of the beacons I do are on Damien's Phanta, and hell if that
thing doesn't always, and I mean always need energy.
I'll send a credit chip for 80 million, in hopes that you'll add in those extra
two.
Also, another question, I was talking to Damien about this, and he asked me to
ask when you and I were talking about this, if the toolset can be crafted. If
so, and how much you'd charge for it.
Thank you so much for all this.
Eve.

Shule,
I really appreciate this.
If it wouldn't be too much trouble, could you please add in two extra energy
dumps, since most of the beacons I do are on Damien's Phanta, and hell if that
thing doesn't always, and I mean always need energy.
I'll send a credit chip for 80 million, in hopes that you'll add in those extra
two.
Also, another question, I was talking to Damien about this, and he asked me to
ask when you and I were talking about this, if the toolset can be crafted. If
so, and how much you'd charge for it.
Thank you so much for all this.

You say, "Let's go."
Lily Kaise grins.
Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
5mT_GojU;WaskN]W5bE'vM/[]x@c*hb{tiDX_au<
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Hello
pilots, as you travel to the bubble or one of our two asteroid hauling stations,
remember to stay safe, keep a check on your charge and please have EAOS credits
on hand for the tolls."
Via general sector communication, a temporary space station transmits, "Current
riftflow conditions are 2009 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Southsouthwest and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's
sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.
