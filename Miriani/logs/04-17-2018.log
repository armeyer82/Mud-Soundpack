["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

07:36 A blast of icy air suddenly explodes from the ceiling vents, carrying with it a flurry of white snowesque frozen water crystals. The hapless frozen water vapor drifts slowly, but inevitably, to the deck plating, where it is immediately melted back into water, effectively ending its life as snow.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

15:21 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

15:21 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

15:21 A large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies freshens the room with the scent of Easter lilies.

15:21 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

15:21 The computer announces, "A star has been detected in the sector."

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and Mekensie the droid here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.
