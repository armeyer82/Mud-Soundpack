Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized
bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and
coral rocks, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, Purr
the humanoid service robot, a purple photocopier, a compact red refrigerator, a
clear plastic food storage container, an insulated green cooler, and Sassie the
large fuchsia felo here.
You can go south and out.

we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad. The hatch appears to be locked.

silver-colored maintenance drones move between the control boxes, directing
chunky, ceiling-mounted mechanical arms bristling with odd tools from ship to

l asteria
a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.

Your communicator reports that...
At least five recently active pilots are relaxing at Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot
Lounge.
What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an
alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny
station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the
Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.

keep a ship charged while traving through the rift."

cruiser."

vessels."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Gemini can only equip solar
panels or the flowmill, and neither is worth it."

Exploraiton ship either."

exploration upgrades on it."

will do."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But well, a gemini isn't really
cut out for huge distance travel. However, if you're so desperate to have a
gemini that can travel vast distances, you can always drop 50 golden taels on
adding solar panels to it."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Not sure you can put a blast
furnace on cruisers."

golden tails to get solar panels?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You use to be able to, I'm
pretty sure I had one on an older reincarnation of Condemnation."

feng wo collective."

you can get a blast furnace for the cruiser. You can't get an impeller, though."

work for long distances does it?"

so far."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You'll need solar
panels to make it truly viable, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Demarco Scott transmits, "And how do you trade
with the collecitve? And how do you get there? I honestly don't think I've been
out there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Take trade goods with
you, craft a lot of junk to trade. Some of the glyphmaker stuff usually sells
pretty well. Just hawk the stuff in the docking bay of one of their stations and
if you're lucky, someone may happen by who wants to buy whatever you're
presently hawking. If you've never been though, I'd advise you wait and go with
someone else so that you don't make a costly mistake that might reflect poorly
on everyone else."

for those trips. I can do GMG stuff as well. And I'll even load some tradesmen
stuff when it's time or close to time. The arrow can be found on Endimeon?"

Lily,
I understand you have goals and things you want to accomplish. All of us do.
Even me. Then again, some of mine are pretty lofty, but that's really not the
point.
I understand the social and financial background you grew up in and I very much
respect that. Having said that, in the two and a half years that you have been a
pilot, you've already accomplished so much more than even the ace pilots did in
the same time period.. You have more credits, more points in every category than
they did. They're still playing catch up to you. Therefore, I think there does
need to be a balance between work, socialising and cultivating relationships.
I wanted to spend quality time with you before you weren't around as often. It's
often difficult to hold long, meaningful conversations when you have to get up
every 5 minutes to rope an asteroid and while to you it may have felt like
waisting time, spending time with the one I love before I know they will be gone
or not around as much, isn't waisting time for me. It's a chance, at least for
me, to become closer and express how much I care about them before my time with
them is severely limited. 
I'm deeply sorry if you got the impression I didn't want to spend time with you.
In fact, it was the opposite. I especially didn't want to get into an argument
right before your time for work would be reduced. I'm sorry this happened and it
wasn't my intent.
Love,

[Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.

You sit up onto a black leather captain's chair.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Comet Surface.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at Asteroid Belt Management Station. The hatch appears to be locked.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole

[Starship "Starseekers' Defender"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "Starseekers' Defender"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and a black leather captain's chair here.

Greetings Starseekers,
This was already sent out as a notice to org communicators, but we'll post it
here too. We'd like to welcome our newest ship: the one-person Bastille
"Starseekers' Defender" to the organization's fleet of ships. A couple reminders
though. First and foremost, this ship does not have a wormhole drive. Therefore,
you will need to either tug it, or dock it in another ship to take it anywhere.
Second, and only slightly less important is that this ship can and often does
draw stronger fighters and corvettes and even escorts. Therefore, just be
forewarned of that. Other than that, have fun and happy fighting!
Regards,

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

[Starship "Starseekers' Defender"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "Aslan"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

Minor Change:
Some changes to beacon drop balance today. It's time to play "good news, bad
news, good news."
 - Base credit rewards for more difficult beacons (higher than standard),
bonuses for destroying larger ships, and bonuses for destroying more numerous
fleets have all been boosted slightly.
 - More difficult beacons will be downgraded to "standard" difficulty for the
purposes of credit and point rewards if any participating ship left the sector
at any point. This rule excludes wasps and rescue pods.
 - A hazard bonus is awarded for facing particularly dangerous weapons, which at
this point includes only long-range lasers.
The end result is that real toe-to-toe fighting on a beacon drop, particularly a
higher difficulty one, should now be more rewarding, while cheesing higher
difficulties will be significantly less rewarding. The new "hazard bonus" should
help to offset situations where leaving for repairs probably isn't optional.
We'll likely continue to tweak these things for a little while.

wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its

small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

[Starship "Aslan"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, and a large
leather couch here.
Ali Candan is lying down.

Recent Minor Changes:
-----
Inserted language into the profile submission system helping players keep track
of their word count, and warning them that longer profiles will take longer to
process.
   Posted 4 days, 4 hours, and 29 minutes ago
-----
Cola is no longer considered solid food.
   Posted 22 hours, 58 minutes, and 3 seconds ago

Some changes to beacon drop balance today. It's time to play "good news, bad
news, good news."
 - Base credit rewards for more difficult beacons (higher than standard),
bonuses for destroying larger ships, and bonuses for destroying more numerous
fleets have all been boosted slightly.
 - More difficult beacons will be downgraded to "standard" difficulty for the
purposes of credit and point rewards if any participating ship left the sector
at any point. This rule excludes wasps and rescue pods.
 - A hazard bonus is awarded for facing particularly dangerous weapons, which at
this point includes only long-range lasers.
The end result is that real toe-to-toe fighting on a beacon drop, particularly a
higher difficulty one, should now be more rewarding, while cheesing higher
difficulties will be significantly less rewarding. The new "hazard bonus" should
help to offset situations where leaving for repairs probably isn't optional.
We'll likely continue to tweak these things for a little while.

[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
n^ww1~e"MB*YN_}|_2$$68)PF~L(zyQSlp&PzXq>
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'RockIt!.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Comet Surface.

In order to free new earth, we have to first free Aenea. It's already most of
the way there.

Subject: Bolt Thrower Test Results
Author: Susie Dodds
Posted: 07:55  1 February 2311 GST

Hopefully this will prove useful to those with the bolt launcher adaptation on
their vessel.
With the assistance of Herrik's new Bolt Thrower and my Heavy Fighter we made
our way into gamma space and proceeded to record the results of this new weapon.
The first test was with the disabling bolt, which Herrik fired at my ship. The
results were that my Coalition drive speed of 5000 Km/s was reduced by 50
percent to 2500 Km/s. Obviously, this will prove very formidable against some of
the faster Outsider and IFS ships.
We then moved on to the disarming bolt, which first had me fire a single torpedo
at the two person Bolt Thrower 'Sharpshooter'.
Having fired a disarming bolt at me, I recorded five percent damage to launcher
one, and then I fired another torpedo. There was no significant change to the
impact of my damage.
Herrik then fired a second bolt, taking launcher one to twenty six percent and
launcher two to twelve percent.
When I returned fire with another torpedo, no damage was recorded.
A final disarming bolt gave me slight damage to a turret and again, another
wasted torpedo from me saw no damage to his ship.
This test was well worth the effort and I think that the Bolt Launcher will be
our own more adaptable chain during invasions, without the concern of being a
sitting duck, unlike the chains.
Overall, and I am no expert on weapons and other ships, however I feel that this
is a weapon which will even up the field during crisis, especially during times
where we have few pilots alert and there are a number of enemy ships to deal
with.
Respectful regards,
Susie Dodds.

Excellent report Dodds!
This is very good information and I think will provide further tactics for
dealing with enemy ships such as Poseidons and other high threat targets in a
more efficent manner than we had in sitatuions like the defense of the United
Stations of the Accord.

So that everyone knows from this point on, do not do beacons in Mutuality space.
You will not get Outsiders. If you got Outsiders it'd be really fucking bad.
Shooting at Tandem Pact ships is a great way to end our trade deals.

Subject: How to tackle a FAS (Forward Assault Station) without causing an
economic crisis for the AEU in the process.
Author: Space Defense Captain Arthur Cross
Posted: 06:03 11 January 2314 GST
--
Due to the catastrophic engagement against an IFS - FAS the 10th of January in
the year 2314, that resulted in the (unnecessary) destruction of a Gemini
Corvette, two Gunships, one Cruiser and a Mule Transport, it was suggested that
a post be made to provide guidelines on how to deal with such a threat without
wasting time and resources needlessly. Lets remember that we are here to protect
AEU interests and assets. That includes both personnel (the pilots) and
materials (our starships). And every mistake made puts both of those things at
risk. That simply won't do.
So first things first. What the heck is a FAS?
A FAS (or Forward Assault Station) is a mean heavy weapon platform launched by
an IFS starship designated Deployment Apollo, over a planet or in a sector they
are attacking. The FAS, like most of the IFS ships has powerful Long Range
Lasers (LRLs) and it will literally lay siege to the sector it's in until it's
taken out of commission. This cannot be done however, unless the station itself
is boarded by a ground combat team using an aerial fortress as insertion method
and subsequently destroyed from the inside via demo-charge. To make things more
complicated, the FAS will come with an entourage of powerful IFS starships that
will guard it zealously.
Now, even though it sounds like a suicide mission, it is not. As long as the
following three steps are followed, a coordinated, well executed attack by
civilian pilots can bring a FAS and it's support fleet down without any losses
whatsoever. 
Step 1: Intelligence -- Know your enemy. If the unfortunate pilot who stumbles
into a sector with a FAS is unable to relay workable data, and the FAS is
deployed in a sector that no Space Defense Captain can observe through an SDC
terminal, send in a single fighter to reconnoiter the threat. It is highly
probably that the FAS is supported by a cruiser class IFS starship with
designation Hades. It tends to be crewed by ace IFS personnel, and it will also
generate an interdiction field in the sector it's in. Making escape by wormhole
drive or leaving the sector impossible. So as to minimize loses, a single
fighter is all you should spare. Whichever the case, take note that IFS ships
are hard to identify as we don't know too much about them. The person who has
eyes on the targets needs scan each of the IFS ships and make note of the ship
classes as well as number designation. This alone is critical.
Step 2: Space Assault -- Clear the skies. Knowing what the threat is, prioritize
the targets. Crew and launch the appropriate number of ships to counter the
threat with the right amount of force. A combined assault of gunships and
cruisers works best to deal with the enemy vessels. Remember that it's highly
likely the area is interdicted by a Hades. It means that once you are in the
sector, you won't be able to get out until the field is down, and the whole as
you chase the Hades or other sources of interdiction, you will be under constant
fire from not only the enemy ships but the FAS as well. Strike fast, strike
true, and terminate each threat in order of priorities. If you don't have the
required crew and/or at the time it's impossible to launch a proper response due
to lack of available warships. DO NOT ENGAGE. Throwing ships in one at the time
may eventually win the battle, but it may cost us the entire war effort. Our
resources are not infinite, and we must deal more damage to the them than to
ourselves. Once the FAS stands alone. Jump out, prepare for Step 3.
Step 3: Ground Assault -- Fire in the hole! Same as step 2. Be sure to bring the
right team for the job. Minimum recommended team composition is of four Tier 5
suits. Minimum of one League suit and one AEU suit for repairs. Anything below
that puts the entire mission at risk, and as a consequence, the whole
engagement. 
Some of you might say, 'But we know this!' And to you I say, 'Good. Now make
everyone else also know this.' The results of todays confrontation with a FAS
left a lot to be desired, and now we must work our assess of to bring our
industry level above the red line before our competence is questioned. We made a
mess this time not due to lack of skill nor lack of weaponry. We simply failed
to protect our resources due to a severe lack of order, discipline and
efficiency. We can't let that happen again. Let's learn from this and do what we
are hired to do.

"Move Along" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "CMX-303-AS" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is faded and slightly scorched and painted a deep green color with
silver trim. Its laser turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in
silver. The bays of its torpedo launchers are oiled to perfection and painted
silver. Its landing struts are slightly rusty and painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo on the port side, a pair of plastic testicles on the forward
end, and a complicated anchor assembly on the underside.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers" and a
wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

This ship will allow you to move around temporary space station modules and
position them properly so that you can create a temporary space structure in the
sector of your choice. Despite being a light cruiser, this vessel does not have
a docking bay, replacing the dockin bay with the module bay. It can hold up to
28 temporary space station modules.
Two-Person Accord Space Module Scout 20,000,000.00 (AFW Command)
AFW SPACE MODULE SCOUT
Class: Scout
Requirements: 20 industry points        300 exploration points
Model number: AFW-071                   Designation: Accord Space Module Scout
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0

Class Modifications:

Max Cruising Speed: 110%
This ship, though smaller than its cousin and able to fit only seven temporary
space station modules has two hours more charge, and also has an exploration
point requirement. Even with this exploration point requirement however, it does
not seem like this ship has exploration-grade sensors, and cannot be fitted with
an impeller upgrade.
AC-2X SPACE CONSTRUCTOR 100,000,000.00 (Aenea)
Class: Light cruiser
Requirements: 2500 industry points
Model number: AC-2X                     Designation: Space Constructor
Turret hardpoints: 4                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 10000        Standard battery hours: 12
Docking bay size required: 225
This vessel is able to hold 28 temporary space station modules, just like the
module transport. However, this particular design which is currently only
available to the AEU, has the added benefits of not needing space lifters at all
for temporary station construction. This is because you can construct the
temporary stations from inside the docking bay, and thenjust push the station
itself out when you need to. It appears that you can have more than one
temporary station constructed and ready for deployment in the module bay at any
given time, but the modules used in the construction will still count towards
the module bay's total limit.

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.

A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal

[Starship "Chemeketa"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Endymion Spaceport; Landing Pad.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Subject: Bruises...a suggestion
Author: usfolks
Posted: Mon Aug  1 16:14:42 2016 UTC

So...In many ways SC attempts to make things quite realistic, offering us
showers (even though we don't get body odor...bummer!). This includes injuries.
Most injuries act the way that real-world injuries do. If a bone is broken, it's
hard to move the appendage. If you have a concussion you get a little wonky in
the head. However...in the real world, some injuries (like bruises) do heal
naturally on their own with absolutely no medical intervention. Almost 3 weeks
ago, my chraracter received a love tap from a friend's friendly little felo. The
bruise is still there. In the real world, this bruise would have changed by
now...faded at least, if not disappeared completely.
So, here is my suggestion. Food is dated in the code...day old food shows that
in the description. I would assume that given this technique is used for food
descriptions, it wouldn't be too terribly hard to figure out something for
bruises, where after a week (for example), it would begin to fade. Maybe I'm
oversimplifying it in my head, as I don't know much at all about MOOCode,
so...just curious then...how hard would this be to do?
As an aside, I wouldn't expect broken bones, concussions, or other injuries to
fade over time, often they get worse without medical intervention. The same can
be said for cuts and gashes. However, very rarely do bruises stay around for
such an extended period of time with no change.
Also, I admit that there may be a reason for this being coded the way it is, so
if so, I'm curious and would love to know.
Thanks for listening!

Actually, I have wanted to see changes to the medical system and am fairly sure
I've said so in the past in some way or other. Aside from bruises not healing
themselves, currently as far as I'm aware, there are no penalties when someone
operates a starship with any sort of injurry. That would definitely be something
I would want to see change. From additional roundtime in performing ship
commands, to being unable to do certain things at all.
I would also imagine this kind of thing to include battlesuit operations, as
well. Often times, and yes, I've been guilty of this before, I have gotten back
into a ground combat mission in the past without even bothering to heal, and
operated my battlesuit as normally as could be. That was probably my own poor
roleplay though, which I would like to think I have since refined.
Lastly, what I've always wanted to see are injurries to other body parts, as
well as different types of injurries. Right now, there are pretty much only
blunt force injurries, and injurries only to one's four limbs and head.
Of course, all of this will most likely require a full recoding of the medical
system, which is probably as old as the game itself. I'm sure that the hosts
have other more relevant things to do at the moment! So, it's probably low on
the priority list.

[New Earth Ship Sales; Salvage Recovery Tools]
As customers and curious tourists enter this store, they inevitably instantly
glance up to observe the massive life-sized salvage recovery grapple suspended
along the ceiling. In one corner of the room, a demonstration electromagnetic
manipulator holds a metal sphere suspended in the air. A few people try to break
the EMM's grip, but they are unable to even budge the sphere.
You can go north.

 You are wearing a casually loose-fitting black t-shirt with a bright red dragon
embroidered on the front, a pair of relaxed fit light khaki cargo pants, and a
pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a
pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of black socks. You are also wearing a
keychain, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a
gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator,
a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a backpack. You are concealing a
flight control scanner, a leather briefcase, a camera bag, an asteroid hauling
supply kit, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a black flightbag
with a red shooting star on the side, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a black
engineering tool case, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, and a
scorched metal thigh holster. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows,
both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
You are carrying nothing.

Even though this starship garage smells like machine oil and heavy lubricants,
it is spacious and well-lit. Massive hydraulic systems raise and lower starships
to and from the landing pad above, and technicians and mechanics in silvery gray
coveralls ensure that everything keeps running smoothly. A well-lit stairway
which leads to the pilot's lounge is here.

additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see

[Starship "Triple Trouble"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Triple Trouble"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

possessing a short, crooked tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
long, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with average, curved brown claws
visible. A violet, diamond nose sits below a pair of bright blue eyes with
horizontal pupils. A pair of vicious sabre-tooth fangs protrude from its mouth.

I suppose my character has never been injured enough (other than possibly once,
and that was when barely even a cadet) to have a situation where roundtime for
injuries he sustained would be relevant. I thought I had read there was
roundtime with broken bones and concussions, at least. What may have helped this
assumption along is another player's good RP when their character had a broken
arm...dropping things occasionally. I figured that was coded and I guess should
have given the player more credit. But...I didn't know.
That being said, I can see this being low on the priorities list, but would echo
what has been said. It would also be nice to, at some point, (something my
character has no problem with keeping up with himself), feel hunger pangs, etc.
Our eating can encourage roleplay, and I must admit, as a *very* new player, I
didn't see that right away.
Forgive me if I'm rambling, I literally just woke up within about 2 minutes of
writing this!...ok, so...what I wanted to add: I hesitated to suggest this, as I
can see it being abused somehow, but in theory, it would be nice for there to be
a penalty for not seeking medical attention for certain types of injures that
lasted past the time when you finally came to your senses and got into a creche.
For example, if you wait a week to treat a broken arm, that arm would always be
stiff and not quite work right. Because I admit that I know little about
MOOCode, I don't know how feasible this would be...also, I can see people using
it to really screw with their characters in a way that could be detrimental to
the game.
Keep an eye out for more things I've thought about, some that may or may not be
popular...we'll see. I enjoy SC thoroughly and want to be a asset to it to the
best of my ability, and...well...I think too much sometimes!

Oh, there are such penalties around, to be sure. You do drop stuff when you have
broken arms, and you do get roundtime when you walk around on a broken leg or
legs. That being said, my message was specifically geared towards starships and
battlesuits, not the penalties that already exist and should continue to exist.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee with a large neon purple dragon
appliqued on the front, a pair of faded blue jeans, and a pair of mystic purple
suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced
plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria',
and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder.
Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both
elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips,

uncovered.
