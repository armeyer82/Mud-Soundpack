00:02:27 Lily Kaise says, "Going out to haul a few. I'll be back in awhile to check if you're interested in doing anything."

00:02:31 Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it.

00:02:34 Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:02:36 Lily Kaise waves.

00:02:38 Lily Kaise glides out.

00:02:38 I don't see "lily" here.

01:02:52 [MTTS] Ulias: The association for clean airwaves PSA almost made me spit my drink out.

01:03:02 [MTTS] Ulias: Way to go.

01:03:07 [MTTS] usfolks: That's my favorite one I think.

01:03:21 [MTTS] Butchulla: That thing always cracks me up.

02:32:46 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]

02:32:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Docking Bay.
You see a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, Meow the little calico CatBot, a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a small purple trash bin here.
You can go south and out.

02:32:50 [Starship "Happy"; Airlock]

02:32:51 You see an early warning space defense device and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

You see a glossy midnight blue ceramic felo chow bowl and Shasta the big onyx soldier felo here.
You can go up.

02:35:58 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Main Deck]

02:35:58 You see a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing light blue and green aquatic life and coral rocks, a small bubbling neon blue-lit toroidal aquarium containing blue and red aquatic life and round rocks, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a robotic chef named Nellie, Mischief the large black felo, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

02:36:00 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]

02:36:00 You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, a red plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated blue cooler, a small white trash bin, Daizey the humanoid service robot, and an insulated pink cooler here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

02:36:05 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:37:34 Lily looks at you and says oh you decided to be sociable.

02:37:40 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:38:52 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:38:54 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:39:11 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:39:46 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:39:50 You say to Lily, "Hi love."

02:39:57 Lily Kaise says, "I could only find a few asteroids. I tried both methods and I salvaged a couple of loads of grade 80 comets and since you weren't interacting, I just decided to leave."

02:40:06 You say, "Awww, I'm sorry."

02:40:09 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it flashes past a viewport overhead.

02:40:09 Not much to see out there.

02:40:23 You say, "Yeah we had a hard time finding asteroids."

02:40:25 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't see the point in sticking around."

02:40:29 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:40:48 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:41:35 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:41:49 Lily Kaise asks, "Maybe later today we could try a couple of beacons?"

02:42:03 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:42:06 You say to Lily, "Sure."

02:43:21 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender.

02:43:38 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:44:32 Lily Kaise says, "I don't remember exactly how much time was left on our scoop too so I want to check that. I don't like letting it go offline for long."

02:45:48 You nod to Lily Kaise. "Yeah, that'd be a good thing to check."

02:45:52 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:45:58 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:46:03 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

02:46:16 Lily Kaise points at an insulated pink cooler.

02:46:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:46:46 an insulated pink cooler

02:46:46 With a lid on the top for easy access to the goodies within, this cooler is insulated to preserve all the food and drinks packed inside.
It is closed.

02:46:51 Lily Kaise says, "I grabbed a few things from the vending machine so help yourself. I'm not always sure what you like from there so hopefully there's something you'll eat hehe."

02:46:56 You open an insulated pink cooler and the light inside clicks on.

02:46:58 an insulated pink cooler

02:46:58 With a lid on the top for easy access to the goodies within, this cooler is insulated to preserve all the food and drinks packed inside.
It is open.
Inside it you see a wrapped Cuban sandwich, a wrapped Cuban sandwich, a wrapped bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich, a wrapped bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich, a wrapped kebab sandwich, a wrapped Cuban sandwich, a wrapped Cuban sandwich, a closed cup of beef stew, a wrapped kebab sandwich, a closed cup of ravioli, and a closed cup of ravioli.

02:47:01 Lily Kaise says, "They're in the pink cooler."

02:47:06 You grin.

02:47:08 You say, "Thanks."

02:47:12 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Sure!"

02:47:21 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

02:47:36 You remove a closed cup of ravioli from an insulated pink cooler.

02:47:41 Lily Kaise grins.

02:47:42 You close an insulated pink cooler.

02:47:50 You twist the bottom of a closed cup of ravioli upward, activating the internal self-heating mechanism.

02:48:00 The bottom of a closed cup of ravioli pops back out as its self-heating is completed.

02:48:45 You pull the lid off a hot cup of ravioli.

02:48:49 You retrieve a steaming forkful of pasta from a hot cup of ravioli and pop it into your mouth.

02:49:10 You take several bites of hot pasta from a hot cup of ravioli.

02:49:14 You look down into a hot cup of ravioli, retrieving more flavorful bites as you near the bottom of the cup.

02:49:17 You finish off a hot cup of ravioli, leaving just a cup of heavily-flavored pasta water.

02:49:22 A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

02:49:27 You put a foam cup in a small white trash bin.

02:50:17 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it flashes past a viewport overhead.

02:50:19 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:50:22 Lily Kaise

02:50:22 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly la
02:50:22 beled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

02:50:29 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:50:51 Shule places gentle kisses on your neck.

02:51:06 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

02:51:15 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

02:51:22 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

02:52:23 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Sure wish we had that flow at our back!"

02:52:28 You say, "Yeah."

02:52:31 You say, "Me too."

02:54:21 Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo wanders in from the airlock.

02:55:00 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:55:05 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:55:20 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist.

02:55:22 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

02:55:36 Lily gently rubs your back.

02:56:12 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:57:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:57:17 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

02:57:27 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

02:58:06 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

02:58:22 Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo wanders out.

02:58:25 You laugh into the PA microphone.

02:58:47 Lily Kaise says, "Be right back."

02:58:50 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

02:58:50 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:58:51 You nod.

02:59:22 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

02:59:46 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]

02:59:46 Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings. Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down. Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, a red plastic food storage container, a compact red refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated blue cooler, a small white trash bin, Daizey the humanoid service robot, and an insulated pink cooler here.
You can go south and out.

03:00:02 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

03:00:10 Lily Kaise puts an elegant crystal decanter on a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern.

03:00:15 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:00:32 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:00:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:03:15 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:04:13 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves.

She is carrying nothing.

03:04:42 Shule slips his hand down the back of your shipsuit and plays with your bra strap.

03:05:37 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:07:30 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

03:07:48 Shule runs his fingers through your hair.

03:08:14 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:08:35 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:08:41 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:08:45 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:08:50 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:09:13 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

03:09:24 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

03:09:29 Shule slips his hand back down the back of your shipsuit and goes back to playing with your bra strap.

03:09:42 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:10:16 You reach for Lily Kaise and tug insistently at a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit, indicating that you want to remove it from her.

03:10:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:13:37 [Short-range Communication] Joseph Riddle transmits, "For landing. Hopefully each perosn land as they need to? That sound good? IE, if the engaging bc needs to land, if three of us stay up, it should work. We just pass off?"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

03:14:37 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

03:14:43 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:14:45 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

03:15:11 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:15:16 Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo wanders in from the airlock.

03:15:16 I don't understand that.

03:15:18 You are carrying nothing.

03:16:14 You reach for Lily Kaise and tug insistently at a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit, indicating that you want to remove it from her.

03:16:19 You pull Lily Kaise's cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit off.

03:16:23 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:18:18 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back.

03:18:39 Lily rubs your back.

03:19:16 Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on Lily Kaise's leg, then rubs its head against her, purring softly.

03:20:16 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

03:20:26 You are carrying a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit in your right hand.

03:20:31 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:20:36 You put a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:20:40 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:20:47 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:21:05 I don't see "chest" here.

03:21:09 You kiss Lily Kaise on the smooth skin above her breasts.

03:22:01 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pair of soft lilac satin bikini panties and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einro
03:22:01 phone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

03:24:31 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:24:48 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:26:56 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:27:00 You kiss Lily Kaise on the smooth skin above her breasts.

03:27:10 Lily Kaise reaches for you and tugs insistently at a red shipsuit with white trim around the collar and cuffs, as if she wants to remove it from you.

03:27:10 Let her? [Enter `yes' or `no']

03:27:12 Lily Kaise pulls your red shipsuit with white trim around the collar and cuffs off.

03:27:16 You grin.

03:27:17 Blueberry the hefty violet feathered felo wanders south.

03:27:20 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:27:26 Lily Kaise puts a red shipsuit with white trim around the collar and cuffs on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:27:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:27:57 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:27:57 "Niple," hmm?  Well, better luck next time.

03:28:05 You kiss Lily Kaise on one nipple.

03:28:09 Lily Kaise says, "Maybe I should see if she wants to sleep."

03:28:14 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

03:28:19 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:28:24 Lily Kaise puts a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

03:29:03 Lily Kaise picks up an insulated blue cooler.

03:29:16 Shule kisses you on your other nipple.

03:29:41 Lily Kaise empties the contents of an insulated blue cooler into a small white trash bin.

03:29:54 Lily Kaise says, "That food has seen it's usefulness."

03:29:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:30:06 Lily Kaise puts an insulated blue cooler in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:30:12 Lily Kaise picks up an insulated pink cooler.

03:30:16 Lily Kaise puts down an insulated pink cooler.

03:30:19 Lily Kaise picks up a red plastic food storage container.

03:30:43 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:30:47 Lily Kaise empties the contents of a red plastic food storage container into a small white trash bin.

03:31:00 Lily Kaise gives you a red plastic food storage container.

03:31:10 Lily Kaise picks up a clear plastic food storage container.

03:31:22 Lily Kaise opens a clear plastic food storage container and the light inside clicks on.

03:31:25 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:31:48 Lily Kaise removes a week old  Danish filled with vanilla custard and topped with sweet white icing and flaked almonds from a clear plastic food storage container.

03:32:27 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:32:53 You say, "Yeah, those are getting a bit old."

03:32:56 Lily Kaise opens an insulated pink cooler and the light inside clicks on.

03:33:06 Lily Kaise empties the contents of a clear plastic food storage container into an insulated pink cooler.

03:33:10 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, a compact red refrigerator, 
03:33:10 a small white trash bin, Daizey the humanoid service robot, and an insulated pink cooler here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

03:33:14 Lily Kaise puts a clear plastic food storage container in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:33:17  You are wearing a green silk pajama top, a pair of red cotton pajama bottoms, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

03:33:17 You are carrying a red plastic food storage container in your right hand.

03:33:23 Lily Kaise closes an insulated pink cooler.

03:33:55 I don't understand that.

03:33:57 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:34:18 Lily says to you, "Are you going to sit down and stay awhile?"

03:34:22 I can't find "sofa."

03:34:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:34:24 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:34:26 You laugh.

03:34:30 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:34:34 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:34:40 "Tummy," hmm?  Well, better luck next time.

03:34:45 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the stomach.

03:35:22 Lily Kaise says, "That flow isn't budging."

03:35:29 You say, "Yeah, I see that."

03:35:49 Lily Kaise says, "Ah well at least we're almost halfway."

03:35:52 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:35:55 You nod.

03:36:16 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

03:36:30 You kiss Lily Kaise on the smooth skin above her breasts.

03:36:41 Lily Kaise leans close to you and kisses you softly on the chest.

03:36:50 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:36:56 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:37:10 Remove what?

03:37:18 You reach for Lily Kaise and tug insistently at a pair of soft lilac satin bikini panties, indicating that you want to remove it from her.

03:37:25 You slide off Lily Kaise's pair of soft lilac satin bikini panties.

03:37:30 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:37:34 You put a pair of soft lilac satin bikini panties on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:37:34 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:37:50 You say to Lily, "Mmmm, I miss seeing you like this."

03:38:49 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:38:55 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:39:36 Shule kisses his way down your chest to your tummy.

03:41:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:42:25 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:42:39 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:42:45 You kiss Lily Kaise on one nipple.

03:44:28 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

03:44:36 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:44:36 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

03:44:39 The computer announces, "Autoforward beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Home Beacon Alpha 271 in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:44:40 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Nuclear Message Beacon transmits, "Dock at the accelerator to charge, otherwise stand by to continue your journey."

03:44:42 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:44:44 There are no other ships in the sector.

03:44:46 Waypoint Rho 272 (Unclaimed) [Known Space] (Security: Delta-10)

03:44:46 Coordinate rundown:
Starships: Star Of Destiny (p) at (6, 7, 4)
Temporary Space Structures: (19, 1, 20), (20, 3, 20)


03:44:55 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:45:10 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:45:20 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:45:20 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:45:22 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:45:24 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist.

03:45:30 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

03:45:33 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:45:48 Shule kisses each of your breasts in turn.

03:46:17 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

03:47:43 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:47:48 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:48:03 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the neck.

03:48:26 Lily Kaise blushes.

03:48:33 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:48:39 Lily Kaise kisses you softly on the neck.

03:49:19 You kiss Lily Kaise on the smooth skin above her breasts.

03:49:34 Lily says to you, "If we could go to GMG next Weekend, it would be awesome. If you have time in your schedule that is."

03:49:40 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:49:43 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:50:00 You say, "It should work for me."

03:50:11 Lily Kaise says, "We'll take the carrier though and put up a decent recharging station."

03:50:31 Lily Kaise says, "That one out there sucks bigtime. I don't even know why they bother with it."

03:51:00 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:51:11 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Awesome!"

03:51:16 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:51:52 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:52:09 Shule caresses you everywhere.

03:52:21 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:52:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:53:02 Lily Kaise says, "Wow silly lizie is still awake."

03:53:14 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:53:30 Lily Kaise says, "Guess i'll let her roam. If she falls asleep in here, she'll be ok if and when we get back and she's asleep."

03:53:38 Lily Kaise removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

03:53:40 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:53:43 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

03:53:46 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:54:17 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

03:54:22 I don't understand that.

03:54:27 Lily Kaise is already comfortably seated.

03:54:38 Shule pulls you into his lap.

03:54:47 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

03:54:51 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

03:54:57 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:54:59 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:55:41 Shule licks your nipple.

03:56:34 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:57:57 You gently caress Lily Kaise's chest and tummy.

03:58:19 Lily Kaise gently caresses your chest and tummy.

03:58:24 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:58:28 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:00:00 Shule slips his hand between your legs and gently caresses you.

04:00:08 Lily Kaise smiles.

04:02:20 Shule continues to caress you between your legs.

04:02:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings. Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down. Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks, a compact red refrigerator, a small white trash bin, Daizey the humanoid service robot, an insulated pink cooler, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on Shule Elemmire's lap.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian co
04:06:17 ntoured couch.)

04:06:23 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:06:57 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:07:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:08:17 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

04:08:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

04:08:42 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:10:11 Shule continues to caress you between your legs.

04:15:22 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

04:15:33 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:15:56 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:16:26 Shule squeezes your butt.

04:16:45 Lily says to you, "I hop e I don't fall asleep here as I'm really sleepy. If I doze off, are you ok with getting us to New Earth from Campeche?"

04:16:56 You grin at Lily Kaise. "Of course."

04:17:02 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:20:28 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:20:32 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:21:19 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:23:09 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:23:39 You say to Lily, "Hmmm, would you let me paint you?"

04:23:45 Lily Kaise says, "Heh."

04:23:52 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Depends on what you would paint!"

04:24:11 You ask, "Or where I'd paint it?"

04:24:16 Lily Kaise says, "Uh yes."

04:24:17 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:24:17 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

04:25:07 You ask, "Ok, so where would I not be allowed to paint on you?"

04:25:22 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I guess my private parts!"

04:25:25 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:25:31 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

04:25:42 You say, "Ah, ok."

04:25:52 Lily Kaise says, "Or areas."

04:26:28 You say, "Ook."

04:26:32 You say, "Er, ok."

04:27:48 You ask, "So, not on your breasts... and such?"

04:28:57 Lily Kaise asks, "I guess but why would you paint with paint that you use on a starship?"

04:29:08 Lily Kaise says, "That seems rather toxic."

04:29:20 Lily Kaise says, "Body paint sure."

04:29:35 You say, "Well, if I could find some body paint..."

04:29:44 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I wouldn't mind."

04:30:00 Lily Kaise asks, "But that stuff in cans... uh you want to paint me with that?"

04:30:12 You say, "No, I wanted to find some body paint."

04:30:50 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah I've never seen any. I have a few colors of glitter though but I don't think you can paint with it. Now that might be kind of nice!"

04:30:59 You grin.

04:32:38 You say, "I don't really have any paint anyways. I was just asking for the future."

04:33:35 You say, "More as a matter of pinciple."

04:33:54 You say, "Principle."

04:33:56 Lily Kaise says, "Ah ok."

04:34:05 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:34:18 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

04:34:33 Lily Kaise says, "I think that would be fun! And to be able to paint free form almost like a tattoo but a tattoo is more permanent."

04:34:40 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:35:01 You say to Lily, "But still not any of your private pats."

04:35:44 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

04:36:18 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

04:36:58 The computer beeps and informs you that the ship is once again within communications range.

04:37:14 You say, "Erm private parts."

04:37:18 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh well our peace and silence ar gone!"

04:37:32 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:37:46 Lily Kaise says, "No I am not referring to my breasts but I think you know what I mean Love heh."

04:38:10 You nod. "Even if it's body paint? Ok."

04:38:25 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

04:38:37 Lily Kaise exclaims, "That trip did our org some good!"

04:39:06 You ask, "Wow, what?"

04:39:17 Lily Kaise says, "Look at our org stats."

04:39:34 You exclaim, "Nice!"

04:40:18 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

04:41:24 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:41:55 I don't see that here.

04:42:01 You say to Lily, "I lov eyou."

04:42:08 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:42:14 Lily says to you, "I love you Hun."

04:43:28 You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hello, here is my report for today. First of all, I would like to take a moment to welcome a few new cadets to the corps. Ishtarr Tiara and Guindalen Jones, I wish you both a warm welcome and a successful career as pilots ahead. Next, I have the state of the corps report as of Friday May 5th for you, which goes as follows. 17 days into the current term, the AEU had completed 10 out of 113 total completed decoy beacon drops (8.85%). The AEU is responsible for 0 out of 10 total destroyed rats nests (0.0%), and finally the AEU is responsible for 0 out of 0 total completed salvage operations. That concludes the state of the corps report. Finally, I will be headed out of communications range again shortly, but I have set up a transmitter station 1 sector south from Campeche which will reach us out there if you have questions, need help or just wanna chat. If any of you cadets want to join us out there, send us a message and we will see if someone can come pick you up. Details on the transmitter are on your message boards under general/exploration, in response to a final op note. This concludes my report for today, Fly safe everyone! Kim Saunders. [08:51  7 May 2317 GST]
89,564,049.28 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:00 10 May 2317 GST]

There are five board posts.

04:43:34 Lily Kaise says, "We only need 148 combat to get the org to 2000 combat now."

04:43:41 You grin.

04:44:18 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

04:44:25 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We took car of a little over half of what we needed before we left. We had 1689 then so yeah this was great!"

04:44:37 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:44:42 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:45:05 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:45:14 You cheer.

04:45:17 Lily Kaise grins.

04:45:28 Lily Kaise says, "That's not as critical though."

04:45:37 You nod.

04:45:45 Lily Kaise says, "That just means we can buy that Fusion battery."

04:45:50 You grin.

04:45:55 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:46:04 Lily says to you, "Thanks so much for helping."

04:46:10 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

04:46:10 "Of course!" You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:46:11 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:46:18 A medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grows still, then flips upside down and bobs to the top of the tank.

04:46:20 There appear to be about 13 pilots recently active.

04:46:22 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

04:46:24 You say, "Aww."

04:46:33 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

04:46:34 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah darn."

04:46:53 Lily Kaise says, "I love that one I guess it's about my favorite but I love other scenery too."

04:47:10 You say, "No, the fish that died."

04:47:24 Lily Kaise says, "Oh damn I didn't see."

04:47:46 Lily Kaise says, "Aww it was a snapper."

04:47:49 Lily Kaise sighs.

04:47:50 Lily Kaise stands up from your lap.

04:47:53 Lily Kaise opens a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks.

04:48:00 Lily Kaise removes a corpse of a medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws from a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks.

04:48:00 You nod.

04:48:08 Lily Kaise pats a corpse of a medium-sized thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws lightly.

04:48:14 Lily Kaise says, "Poor little snapper."

04:48:19 You nod.

04:48:21 Lily Kaise glides south.

04:49:02 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

04:49:12 Lily Kaise says, "I'm glad I didn't see it bob."

04:49:23 Lily Kaise says, "That always makes me sad."

04:49:35 Lily Kaise carefully removes a dark gray egg from a neon purple efficient round egg storage container.

04:49:38 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:49:48 Lily Kaise runs a small silver genetic tester slowly over a dark gray egg as the device blinks a light and beeps softly.

04:49:48 Lily Kaise studies a small screen on the device.

04:49:58 Lily Kaise removes a neon purple efficient round egg storage container from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

04:49:58 Lily Kaise puts a dark gray egg in a neon purple efficient round egg storage container.

04:50:14 Lily Kaise studies a small screen on the device.

04:50:18 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

04:50:23 Lily Kaise puts a dark gray egg in a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and amethyst aquatic life and coral rocks.

04:50:23 A dark gray egg wiggles for a moment, then a large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws emerges!

04:50:39 Lily Kaise says, "There we go now the other one has a new friend."

04:50:43 Lily Kaise closes a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

04:50:49 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

04:51:03 I don't understand that.

04:51:08 I don't understand that.

04:51:10 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:51:14 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:53:08 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:53:16 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:53:18 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the south.

04:53:23 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Prissy the big violet long-haired felo.

04:53:23 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

04:57:31 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:57:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

04:58:27 Shule gently caresses you everywhere.

04:59:16 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:59:45 Lily Kaise says, "Good our scoop is still up."

04:59:45 Shule runs his fingers though your hair.

04:59:51 You grin.

05:00:06 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]

05:00:06 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a compact red refrigerator, a sma
05:00:06 ll white trash bin, Daizey the humanoid service robot, an insulated pink cooler, Prissy the big violet long-haired felo, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on Shule Elemmire's lap.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.)

05:00:19 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

05:00:27 Lily Kaise says, "So is the asteroid processorin 285. Relieved as they would be bitching and complaining if it went down while we were still out there."

05:00:46 You grin.

05:00:51 Lily Kaise grins at you.

05:01:18 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

05:01:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:01:55 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:02:17 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:02:47 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:07:34 Lily Kaise says, "Nada."

05:07:39 You nod.

05:10:19 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

05:12:14 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:12:23 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:12:40 You say to Lily, "Sorry babe. I didn't mean to push too much affection when you're tired."

05:12:54 Lily Kaise says, "It's all right Love."

05:13:18 Lily Kaise says, "I'm jsut frustrated with myself that I'm not more awake."

05:13:28 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:13:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:14:03 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Don't me. More my fault and my weakness."

05:14:12 Lily Kaise says, "Aww not so."

05:14:18 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:14:43 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:15:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

05:16:09 Lily Kaise says, "Think I'll get her so she won't fall asleep in here."

05:16:11 Lily Kaise stands up from your lap.

05:16:13 Lily Kaise glides south.

05:16:17 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

05:16:22 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

05:16:24 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

05:16:25 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

05:16:31 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:16:31 Lily Kaise says, "Hey dude."

05:16:34 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:16:38 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:17:06 Lily Kaise says into the external PA microphone, "if you come in here, i'll stand my ground and shoot"

05:17:10 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:17:14 You chuckle.

05:17:48 Lily Kaise says into the external PA microphone, "and even if you only come in here with a bottleof tea and candy I'll still shoot"

05:17:53 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:17:57 You laugh.

05:18:37 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:19:00 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:19:04 Lily Kaise says, "There's 271."

05:19:21 You grin.

05:19:32 Lily Kaise grins.

05:20:24 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:20:29 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:21:09 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:22:44 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 260,972.94 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

05:24:19 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:24:26 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:25:09 Lily Kaise asks, "Ugh we have to move the pets and things back to Dove. I vote we just sleep in happy this morning and take care of it later?"

05:25:21 You nod to Lily Kaise.

05:25:26 You say, "I very much second that."

05:25:31 Lily Kaise grins at you.

05:25:35 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:25:48 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:25:55 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:26:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:26:08 Lily Kaise says, "Woo almost there."

05:26:13 You nod.

05:26:15 You grin.

05:26:31 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:26:31 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

05:26:34 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AEU Rift Accelerating Solar Autonav Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

05:26:34 Via general sector communication, AEU Beaconed Stealth Nuclear Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic North."

05:26:36 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

05:26:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:26:39 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

05:26:42 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

05:26:48 Lily Kaise glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

05:26:48 The starship transitions into another sector.

05:26:51 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

05:26:51 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Green 8" has jumped into the sector.

05:26:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:26:52 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

05:26:52 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Yellow 9" has jumped into the sector.

05:26:53 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Orange 6" has jumped into the sector.

05:26:56 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

05:26:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:26:57 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Green 8" has jumped out of the sector.

05:26:57 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

05:26:57 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Yellow 9" has jumped out of the sector.

05:26:59 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Orange 6" has jumped out of the sector.

05:27:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:27:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:27:03 There are no other ships in the sector.

05:27:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:27:03 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:27:05 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

05:27:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:27:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:27:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:27:09 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

05:27:12 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Star Of Destiny! Welcome to home space!"

05:27:14 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

05:27:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

05:27:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:27:37 You smile.

05:27:41 Lily Kaise smiles.

05:27:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:27:44 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

05:27:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Star Of Destiny. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

05:27:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

05:27:53 I don't understand that.

05:27:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

05:27:59 You are credited with 29,361,624.26 AEU credits of bounty.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire has automatically contributed 1,468,081.21 AEU credits.

05:28:05 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

05:28:16 Lily Kaise says, "Wow bounty."

05:28:19 You grin at Lily Kaise.

05:28:19 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

05:28:20 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

05:28:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

05:28:26 Lily Kaise exclaims, "That was a lot!"

05:28:33 You nod.

05:28:56 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a shiny round deep amethyst table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a compact red refrigerator, a small wh

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

19:34:22 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:34:38 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:34:38 You begin the docking sequence.

19:34:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

19:34:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:34:53 You peer out...

[Asteroid Belt Management Station]
This is an asteroid belt management station. Through large transparisteel windows, you can see the asteroid stations themselves glittering amongst the tumbling asteroids of the belt. The station managers need never actually visit these stations, however, instead conducting their business via a number of terminals.
The four-person mule "Liberator", the scout "Pathseeker", the vostok-class capsule "Bolt", and the vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" are parked here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go nowhere.

19:34:55 You scramble to your feet.

19:34:55 You exit the capsule.

19:36:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:36:22 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:36:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:36:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:36:26 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:36:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:36:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:36:30 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:36:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

19:36:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:36:35 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:36:37 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Shooting Star! Welcome to home space!"

19:37:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:37:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

19:37:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Shooting Star. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

19:37:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:37:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:37:28 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:37:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:37:30 You exit the capsule.

19:37:30 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
The vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

19:37:32 Your ship 'Shooting Star' has been automatically moved into a garage.

19:37:32 You key in a transport of William Dove to your location.

19:37:32 The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

19:37:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

19:37:35 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

19:37:38 Board what?

19:37:39 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

19:37:39 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

19:39:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, we should."

19:39:58 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sure."

19:40:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What does that entail?"

19:40:31 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

19:40:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It entails launching a beacon to draw outsiders and then destroying their ships."

19:40:39 Lily Kaise kisses you.

19:40:43 You kiss Lily Kaise.

19:40:50 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Hi babe."

19:41:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's great for credits and points."

19:41:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, we take a combat ship, fly it into uncharted, launch this beacon, wait a few minutes and then destroy the outsiders that show up."

19:41:11 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

19:41:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That sounds awesome."

19:41:47 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

19:41:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, it is definitely good work that is rewarded decently."

19:42:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And good luck with the pod Vernos, doing them in pairs is more fun than solo."

19:42:22 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

19:42:29 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

19:42:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am down for the beacon after."

19:42:41 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

19:42:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hello Everyone."

19:42:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hello."

19:46:38 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

19:47:59 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Boobs are nice."

19:48:01 You kiss Lily Kaise.

19:48:09 Lily Kaise kisses you.

19:48:14 [General Communication] Jacob Smitt transmits, "You tell her, I'm not going to take a chance at getting hit."

19:48:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not if they're keepin him from Vernos and the promised pod at SVP."

19:48:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs. "Doubt she'd hitcha."

19:48:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wait."

19:48:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Better be safe."

19:48:54 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

19:49:53 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I love you."

19:50:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "How nice!"

19:51:10 You chuckle.

19:51:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I have not flown these in what, uh, 4 months?"

19:51:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "About as long as I have."

19:51:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles. "I guess I have been drafted then."

19:51:38 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

19:51:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Or perhaps, I should say have not?"

19:51:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

19:51:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yep, you've been volunteered."

19:52:38 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

19:53:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Fear not, Asteria has promised that she'll take over if necessary."

19:53:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, I will better get some beacons then."

19:54:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, yeah. Guess I should get some of those one of these days if I want to run my own."

19:54:32 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist.

19:54:43 You say to Lily, "You up for beacons some time soon?"

19:55:01 Lily Kaise says, "I ohly have about an hour and then won't be at work for a couple of hours."

19:55:05 Lily Kaise says, "Only."

19:55:12 You say, "Oh, ok."

19:55:37 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

19:56:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well,should we run one while we're waiting for Vernos?"

19:56:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do wonder, should we do a high pulsar, or maybe take a gunship?"

19:56:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Up to you."

19:56:38 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

19:57:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I suggest we wait. Vernos has had some gunning practivce, not sure on Constantine."

19:57:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah, good idea."

19:57:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, in that case, I'd recommend a gunship. But that's just me."

19:57:56 Lily Kaise says, "Not offering mine."

19:57:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I think so too."

19:58:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "One of these days I want to try flying."

19:58:02 You say, "Nope."

19:58:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "We can help you with that."

19:59:00 You say to Lily, "Nah, she can use hers."

19:59:07 You say, "Not offering mine either."

19:59:09 Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

19:59:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I suggest practicing in the Sim over on Accord."

19:59:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And you could talk to Ather about flying lessons."

21:26:18 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

21:30:30 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

21:30:30 Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people. The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.

[Starship "The Wolves Have Claws"; Weapons Room Three]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
Vernos Bailey is standing here.

21:39:12 You nod to Kim Saunders.

21:39:24 You say, "Neither am I."

21:39:24 The starship transitions into another sector.

21:39:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:39:27 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "A few minutes in a cruiser."

22:02:18 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Istanbul in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:02:21 Via general sector communication, Istanbul transmits, "Hello there, The Wolves Have Claws! Welcome to home space!"

22:02:24 Bryan Stout says into the PA microphone, "Back to the old standby, spinwards and minis and get this thing back on track to kick ass and take names."

22:02:27 Bryan Stout presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

22:02:27 Bryan Stout trips over Vernos Bailey as he attempts to work with a nearby control panel.

22:02:27 Vernos Bailey says, "My fill of excitement for the day is done."

22:02:30 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Istanbul.

22:05:26 
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-47", the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-68", and the six-person pincer "The Wolves Have Claws" are landed here.

See you soon hopefully,
Eve.

22:09:15 You crumple up a sheet of white paper and throw it in a nearby garbage can.

22:09:18 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

22:09:18 You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

22:09:45 You hear a soft ringing sound on the line.

22:09:51 You hear a soft ringing sound on the line.

22:09:51 The ringing stops as the other end is picked up.

22:09:55 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Well hi you."

22:10:01 You say, "Well, hey sexy."

22:10:10 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "I thought this might be a good idea."

22:10:23 You say, "Yeah, I was going to send you a letter asking for yours."

22:10:35 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Well, I got to it first. I am in the directory though."

22:10:49 You say, "I see that. Well, thanks for giving me your number."

22:11:13 You say, "Awesome."

22:11:23 You ask, "So, what are you up to?"

22:11:37 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "All of nothing. Relaxing at home."

22:11:47 You ask, "Nice! And where is home?"

22:11:59 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "An apartment on Chetumal."

22:12:19 You say, "Nice! I have one on Residential structure."

22:12:43 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Damn. Here I was hoping you had one of those gorgeous ones on new earth. They are simply amazing."

22:12:54 You say, "It wouldn't be hard for me to get one."

22:13:15 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Oh? But you'd probably get found out, then have your insides ripped out."

22:13:24 You say, "Yeah, exactly."

22:14:12 You ask, "Pretty please?"

22:14:22 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah ask, "Where might you be hiding?"

22:14:43 You say, "In one of my ships on New Earth, but Residential Structure might be better."

22:15:19 You place a metallic gold touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

22:15:21 [Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]

22:15:21 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a large leather couch, and a polished rosewood bar here.
You can go south and out.

22:15:36 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go out.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:15:38 You sit down.

22:15:38 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

22:15:39 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:15:39 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:15:40 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:15:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Shooting Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:15:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:15:46 The ship is already moving.

22:15:54 The ship is already moving.

22:15:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:15:55 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Calm. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:15:55 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:15:56 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

22:15:59 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:15:59 The motion of the ship throws your body from side to side, but your seatbelt holds you in place.

22:16:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:16:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:16:02 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:16:03 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Calm."

22:16:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:16:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:16:07 The sensors tell you that this area of space is remarkably clear and free of hazards.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Residential Structure in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:16:10 Via general sector communication, Residential Structure transmits, "Greetings, Shooting Star! Welcome to The Calm!"

22:16:13 There are no other ships in the sector.

22:16:37 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:16:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:16:52 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

22:16:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Shooting Star. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

22:16:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:17:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:17:12 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:17:41 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:17:41 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:17:43 You scramble to your feet.

22:17:43 You exit the capsule.
[Residential Structure; Docking Bay]
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 597" and the vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" are landed here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

22:17:43 You can't go that way.

22:17:48 The vostok-class capsule "Shooting Star" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

22:17:52 [Residential Structure; Docking Bay]

22:17:52 This docking bay is relatively quiet compared to most other similar facilities. As with other EAOS docking bays, the entire structure appears open to space, yet no air escapes. Signs indicate that the lobby is on the level above, and Spaceport facilities are below.
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 597" is landed here.

22:18:40 Evenia Callseah grins at you.

22:18:40 You hug Evenia Callseah.

22:18:45 Evenia Callseah hugs you.

22:18:45 You hold Evenia Callseah's hand, taking her into your group.

22:18:50 You can't go that way.

22:18:54 You open the door to Apartment 4003.

22:18:54 [Residential Structure; Apartment 4003]
You see a mahogany coffee table, a padded rocking chair, a faux oak entertainment center, a polished rosewood bar, a grand piano with a white finish, a padded black stool, and an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and out.
Evenia Callseah followed you.
You close the door.

22:19:02 I don't understand that.

22:19:07 You add Evenia Callseah as a resident.

22:19:11 Evenia Callseah beams at you.

22:19:15 You beam at Evenia Callseah.

22:19:20 You say to Evenia, "Hi sexy."

22:19:23 You kiss Evenia Callseah.

22:19:30 Evenia Callseah says, "Hi you gorgeous thing you."

22:19:32 Evenia Callseah kisses you.

22:19:51 You sit down on an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric.

22:19:55 Evenia Callseah sits down on your lap.

22:20:01 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

22:20:06 Evenia Callseah wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

22:20:11 You beam.

22:20:35 Evenia Callseah says, "I do have to wonder what in fuck took us so long to figure this out."

22:20:38 Shule leans down and places a gentle kiss on your lips.

22:20:42 You laugh at Evenia Callseah.

22:20:44 You say, "Me too."

22:21:14 Evenia looks adoringly into your eyes and tenderly kisses your lips.

22:21:54 While caressing your back, Shule places more gentle kisses on your neck.

22:21:57 Evenia Callseah

22:21:57 She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her abdomen is muscular and punctuated by a small navel. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her close-cropped, bristly hair is indigo and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces her right upper ear, a small bloodstone stud with a matching spider charm pierces her belly button, a thick gold ring pierces her right lower lip, and a thick gold ring pierces her left lower lip.
 She is wearing a finely crafted choker of polished rounded squares of blue and gold dichroic glass, an indigo leather jacket trimmed with steel studs, an indigo silk cropped top, a pair of heavy black leather forearm bands with eleven rows of ve
22:21:57 ry long darkly gleaming steel spiked studs, a pair of silky black pants, and a pair of black leather boots with medium heels and steel buckles up the sides. She is also wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic glass dolphin, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a glossy obsidian wrist-mounted chronometer, a metallic gold messenger bag, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a delicately carved red stone firefly ring, a metallic gold flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side, a teal battle hummingbird stamp, and a Tardick lizard named Zeus perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, abdomen, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

22:22:37 Evenia snuggles in closer to you, quickly removing her choker so you can have better access to her neck and blushing a little at what you see there.

22:22:40 Evenia Callseah unfastens a finely crafted choker of polished rounded squares of blue and gold dichroic glass and pulls it from her neck.

22:22:45 Evenia Callseah opens a small black leather zip pouch for a moment.

22:23:46 You squeeze Evenia Callseah affectionately.

22:23:49 Evenia Callseah says into her glossy obsidian metachannel FTL communicator, "Oh, that's um. That's near farport. That's the first GMG beacon thing."

22:24:01 Evenia Callseah squeezes you affectionately.

22:24:17 Evenia Callseah asks, "You know, you're one of only 4 people that's ever seen me without a choker?"

22:24:33 You say, "Oh really? I feel privilaged."

22:24:49 "I am ashamed of that scar." Evenia Callseah nods. "I never show it."

22:25:37 You say, "Awww, I'm sorry. It must have been... traumatic whatever happened. I wont' press you to know what happened, but your secrets are always safe with me."

22:26:26 You say, OOCly, "Need a couple."

22:26:32 Evenia Callseah nods to you.

22:27:02 Evenia Callseah says into her glossy obsidian metachannel FTL communicator, "That's true. But Johann. You could take him in and at least explain how it all works."

22:27:25 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Evenia Callseah's neck.

22:27:57 Evenia Callseah says into her glossy obsidian metachannel FTL communicator, "I am. I wanna start all the plants, and all the things. And and and..."

22:28:01 Keying her glossy obsidian metachannel FTL communicator, Evenia Callseah laughs.

22:29:11 You gently caress Evenia Callseah's back and waist.

22:29:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "How many more beacons did I miss?"

22:29:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

22:29:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Just one aboard Bryan's pincer."

22:29:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok."

22:30:04 I don't know which "lily" you mean.

22:30:19 Evenia softly kisses your neck, gently running her hands down your sides.

22:30:42 You whisper to Evenia Callseah.

22:31:10 Evenia blushes slightly and murmurs into your ear, "Do you really want the truth?"

22:31:29 Shule smiles and whispers back, "Of course."

22:31:55 [Tactical Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "What tier?"

22:33:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah I was up there going oh my god."

22:33:27 "So?" You grin at Evenia Callseah.

22:33:32 Evenia Callseah says, "When I first met you, I thought you were like...The hottest guy in the galaxy. But Lily wasn't around at that time so I thought you were single. Then I figured out that you weren't, and spent months being like, burning damn jealous that she had you. I've pretty much wanted you since the start. That's why every chance I got, I'd go on beacons. Every chance I could, just to see you."

22:33:59 You say, "Awww."

22:34:01 You blush.

22:34:16 You say, "Thanks for the compliment."

22:34:23 You say, "I thought everyone wanted Cesar."

22:34:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I can not believe I flew that."

22:34:42 Evenia Callseah snorts. "I'd rather fuck a felo."

22:34:50 You chuckle.

22:34:52 You exclaim, "Wow!"

22:35:13 Evenia Callseah says, "Cesar is an arrogant fucking dickhead. I never wanted Cesar."

22:35:23 Evenia Callseah says, "He wanted me though. Well, he wanted my body."

22:35:29 Shule continues to caresses your back and arms, kissing his way down your neck.

22:35:34 You say, OOCly, "Oops."

22:35:47 You say to Evenia, "I'm not surprised."

22:36:01 Evenia Callseah blushes.

22:36:02 You say, "He wanted anything that had two boobs and a slit and two loegs."

22:36:06 You say, "Legs."

22:36:36 Evenia Callseah says, "Well, I have boobs I think. Though Joel calls them cannons."

22:36:40 Evenia Callseah grins.

22:36:41 You laugh.

22:37:01 You say, "Cesar wanted anything female."

22:37:18 You say, "And yes, I agree. He was rather arrogant."

22:37:46 Evenia Callseah says, "Cesar would take a cadet on a cruiser in like their first week, and make them fly a high."

22:37:53 You say, "Yeah, I now."

22:37:55 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Evenia Callseah's shoulder.

22:37:56 You say, "Know."

22:38:10 Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her abdomen is muscular and punctuated by a small navel. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin.

Her close-cropped, bristly hair is indigo and shaven down to stubble except for a spikey mohawk. She has long painted metallic gold fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair. She has a past injury on her throat.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces her right upper ear, a small bloodstone stud with a matching spider charm pierces her belly button, a thick gold ring pierces her right lower lip, and a thick gold ring pierces her left lower lip.

Her head, face, both eyes, neck, abdomen, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

22:38:17 Evenia Callseah says, "So does Zeus apparently."

22:38:35 You reach for Evenia Callseah and tug insistently at an indigo leather jacket trimmed with steel studs, indicating that you want to remove it from her.

22:38:41 You pull Evenia Callseah's  indigo leather jacket trimmed with steel studs off.

22:38:48 You put down an indigo leather jacket trimmed with steel studs.

22:38:52 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

22:38:55 Evenia Callseah grins at you.

22:39:30 Evenia winks at you and softly runs the very tip of her tongue down your neck.

22:40:13 Shule smiles and caresses your back with one hand while letting the other caress your chest and tummyy.

22:40:19 Evenia says to you, "Mind if I let Zeus nap while we cuddle? I don't like snuggling with him on my shoulder."

22:40:23 You say, "Nope."

22:40:26 You say, "Go for it."

22:40:31 Evenia Callseah carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Zeus from her shoulder.

22:40:33 Evenia Callseah puts down a Tardick lizard named Zeus.

22:40:56 A Tardick lizard named Zeus settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

22:41:01 You look at a Tardick lizard named Zeus and smile.

22:41:05 Evenia Callseah grins at a Tardick lizard named Zeus.

22:41:12 Evenia says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus, "If you could, all you'd do is sleep."

22:41:18 You chuckle. "Probably."

22:41:30 Evenia Callseah says, "Or eat."

22:41:35 You say, "Eat and sleep."

22:41:40 Evenia Callseah nods.

22:41:43 You say, "Such a tough life."

22:41:50 Evenia Callseah says, "I tend to have him more than Melinda does."

22:41:56 You say, "I see that."

22:42:28 "She knows how much I adore him, so she just lets me enjoy him." Evenia Callseah nods. "If there's anything at all I want as a pilot, it's a lizard. I'd sell everything I own just to have one."

22:42:47 Shule slips his hand slowly down the front of your crop top and caresses your chest, "Me too. I want a lizard."

22:43:23 Evenia grins at you and softly runs one hand down your chest. "Well, there's no lizard there, but there are cannons."

22:43:30 You grin.

22:43:58 Remove what?

22:44:02 You reach for Evenia Callseah and tug insistently at an indigo silk cropped top, indicating that you want to remove it from her.

22:44:12 You pull Evenia Callseah's  indigo silk cropped top off over her head.

22:44:18 You put down an indigo silk cropped top.

22:44:22 Evenia Callseah says, "And well. You already have your own lizard. Of sorts."

22:44:25 Evenia Callseah winks at you.

22:44:29 You grin.

22:44:45 You kiss Evenia Callseah on one of her breasts.

22:44:56 Evenia Callseah shakes her slightly larger than average firm breasts tipped with large dark brown nipples. Both nipples are pierced with a shiny gold ring.

22:45:03 Evenia Callseah asks, "Don't you just love them?"

22:45:03 You grin.

22:45:09 You say, "I do."

22:45:17 You gently cup Evenia Callseah's breasts with your hands and massage them softly.

22:46:56 Smiling, Shule kisses each of your breasts in turn.

22:47:17 Evenia gently presses her breasts into your hands and gently tugs at your polo.

22:47:24 Evenia Callseah reaches for you and tugs insistently at a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, as if she wants to remove it from you.

22:47:25 Let her? [Enter `yes' or `no']

22:47:27 Evenia Callseah pulls your soft Bahama blue cotton polo off over his head.

22:47:31 Evenia Callseah puts down a soft Bahama blue cotton polo.

22:47:55 Shule wraps his arms around you andd presses his face into your breasts.

22:48:38 Evenia smiles and presses her breasts into your face, gently holding your head there with her hand.

22:48:51 You cuddle up to Evenia Callseah.

22:49:06 Evenia Callseah cuddles up to you.

22:49:17 Evenia Callseah asks, "Imagine trying to fly with these in your face?"

22:49:47 You say, "Ummm, I think I'd be so distracted I'd forget to move the ship."

22:49:54 Evenia Callseah giggles.

22:49:58 You chuckle.

22:50:10 Evenia softly runs her fingers through your hair.

22:50:31 Shule runs his tongue gently around each of your nipples.

22:51:08 Evenia moans softly and shivers.

22:52:17 Shule begins to kiss and lick a trail down the front of your body.

22:52:49 Evenia leans back slightly to give you better access, her eyes half closing with pleasure.

22:53:58 Shule continues to kiss his way down across your tummy, then placing his hands on either side  of your waist, he tugs gently on your pants.

22:54:10 You reach for Evenia Callseah and tug insistently at a pair of silky black pants, indicating that you want to remove it from her.

22:54:21 You tug Evenia Callseah's pair of silky black pants off over her legs.

22:55:54 Moving his hands to your shoulders, Shule gently turns you and pushes you back on to the sofa.

22:56:17 Evenia sighs contentedly and lays back on the sofa.

22:56:19 Evenia Callseah lies down on an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric.

22:56:22 You stand up from an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric.

22:56:26 You sit down.

22:57:10 Shule brushes his fingers lover your chest and tummy then, with his tongue, lifts the waistband of your panties.

22:58:01 Evenia gasps and squirms, arching her hips slightly toward you.

22:59:03 Smiling lustfully at you, Shule continues to make eye contact as he kisses his way over your panties to between your legs.

23:00:32 Evenia's hot stair burns deeply into your eyes as she nods slightly at you. "Whatever you want, do it. My body is yours to enjoy however you wish."

23:01:28 Shule grins up  at you as he gently spreads your legs and runs first his fingers, then his tongue along the underside of your panties.

23:02:30 Evenia moans deeply, one hand coming down to tangle gently in your hair.

23:03:24 Shule looks up at you with blaing desire before burying his face between your legs and kissing the inside of each leg then your sex.

23:04:53 Shule begins to repeatedly caress the underside of your panties with his tongue.

23:04:58 Evenia gasps, arching her hips up toward you and parting her legs further.

23:05:40 Moving hsi hands to your waist, Shule tugs down on your panties and whispers, "These are in my way."

23:06:01 You slide off Evenia Callseah's pair of sexy red silk g-string panties.

23:06:08 You put down a pair of sexy red silk g-string panties.

23:06:39 Shule leans down and ever so gently runs his tongue the full length of your slit.

23:07:42 Evenia moans deeply, arching her hips up toward you and pressing her sex against your lips. "Damn it, stop teasing and eat me. I want you."

23:09:09 I don't understand that.

23:09:47 You hear him softly chuckle, then Shule begins to ravish your sex, sucking and licking your clit. Soon he slips a finger inside and rubs your clit with his thumb.

23:12:09 As he feels you get more and more wet, Shule slips a second finger inside you, and you feel him press up against your g-spot. All the while, he continues to lick and suck your clit.

23:13:30 Evenia moans loudly, rapping her legs up around your neck, pressing your face only harder against her.

23:17:43 Evenia groans, "Fuck, keep that up, and Imma cover your face in my juices." Then she tightens her fingers in your hair.

23:18:28 Shule is unrelenting in his oral assault of your sex.

23:20:38 Shule occasionally removes his fingers and slips his tongue inside you, driving it deep and exploring vigorously with it.

23:21:16 Evenia lets out a high moan/shriek as her whole body tenses and shudders. Her hips thrust upward and a virtual torrent of sweet juice flows out of her and over your tongue and face, as she climaxes hard. As this happens, she almost unintentionally pulls hard on your hair.

23:22:29 Shule licks up the juices as they flow from you and squeees you gently, then pulling back, he looks up at you and smiles, "Was  that good?"

23:23:37 Evenia sighs, her eyes mostly closed and murmurs, "Oh sanity yes. Damn yes. You're amazing."

23:24:02 Shule licks and lips, "MMMM, you taste delicious!"

23:25:52 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

23:26:19 Evenia molds her body to yours, pressing up with her hips and smiling as she feels your rock hardness against her.

23:27:15 Shule lifts  his hips briefly and  slipping hand hand between both of you, he places the head of his sex at your entrance.

23:27:25 You say, OOCly, "Ugh, I can't type. So sorry."

23:28:23 Evenia arches up slightly, parting her legs more and pressing up, inviting you inside her.

23:29:02 Shule pushes his hips forward and in one smooth motion, penetrates you to the hilt.

23:29:52 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "Bus always go where it must."

23:30:06 Shule begins to move his hips  rhythmically, slow at first, but gradually increasing his pace.

23:32:44 Evenia moans, "Oh fuck yes." as she slips her ankles around your neck and locks them together, her body urging yours to move harder and deeper.

23:36:06 Shule's caresses your back, waist and butt. Then gently but firmly, he gives you a pat on your butt.

23:37:32 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Beacons?"

23:37:45 Evenia groans in deep pleasure as she feels the slap on her butt. She arches up hard, demanding everything from you.

23:39:03 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Hello new AEU cadet."

23:39:13 Evenia groans. "I fucking love that. Pound me, slap me, just...Oh fuck." and she bites almost firmly at your neck, all control gone with the pleasure you're giving her.

23:40:19 Shule gives you another slap on the butt, harder this time as he continues to pound into you, "Oh god, I'm going to cum soon!".

23:41:59 Evenia tilts her head back, letting out long moans of pleasure. "Fuck yes, fill me babe, fill me with those beautiful hot juices."

23:44:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

23:44:49 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Smarter, Active AEU corps is coming, be prepared!"

23:44:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Huh."

23:45:19 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh responding to Pierre and Johann."

23:45:28 Shule collapses on top of you, his breaths coming in short, heavy gasps.

23:45:57 Evenia slowly brings her legs down and holds you close. Softly playing tender kisses over your face.

23:46:10 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Pierre said the AEU hordes were coming."

23:46:30 Shule smiles at you, returning the kisses with ones of his own and wrapping you tight in his arms.

23:49:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Especially if you're carrying around modules."

23:49:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Looks like the GMG stuff."

23:49:36 Evenia smiles softly at you, continuing to hold you warmly.

23:49:44 You kiss Evenia Callseah on the lips.

23:49:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It would be useful though when we're guilding stations out of comms though. If there's no intermediate charger along the way, then there are limitations obviously."

23:50:00 Evenia Callseah kisses you on the lips.

23:50:46 You say to Evenia, "I should warn you, I do have a bit of a kinky side to me. That maybe a bit surprising."

23:51:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "From what the store said about it, it can construct stations inside of the bay."

23:51:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep."

23:51:41 Evenia grins wickedly at you. "If it manages to be as kinky as mine, we're gonna get along fine. What is it that gets you hot?"

23:51:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I like the idea of being able to have them built so you can just get in and shove it out hte bay and get out."

23:51:57 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Sorry SSn, I did not know a glittering toilet was a lovely item, they just started."

23:52:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

23:52:11 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I think it's a crappy item!"

23:52:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Course it is."

23:52:29 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "No, its the other word, item."

23:52:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you had folks ready to go, you could even use it for rapid watchtower deployment, couuld be pretty useful."

23:52:49 Shule grins and laughs, "Well, I've been in threesomes, played with spanking and even whips.... I think you get the picture?

23:52:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No, a toilet is definitely not an item. More like a widget."

23:52:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes indeed."

23:53:11 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "A curiouisly molded widget?"

23:53:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Maybe."

23:53:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'm building an asteroid processor as we speak."

23:53:43 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Temporary Station in Outpost M-724.

23:54:16 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Hey, its only 2999.99."

23:54:19 You say to Evenia, "I've played with most of the stuff that can be purchased at... Oh where's that place on Chet. The other city that I can never remember the name."

23:55:01 "I'm not into sharing." Evenia Callseah grins at you. "But everything else, damn fuckin' right. Are you more dominant?"

23:55:11 You say, "Ixtapa, yeaht that's what it's called. I've played with most of the stuff there."

23:55:34 You say, "Well, the sharing was because the girl asked for it. It wasn't my idea."

23:55:43 You nod to Evenia Callseah. "I am."

23:55:48 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "There, its gone, guess I was thinking it started, oh haha it I turned it on just before it ended, no wonder I thought they just began."

23:56:17 [General Communication] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "Hey, bat wings, odd."

23:56:30 Evenia Callseah says, "Mmm, the idea of completely submitting to you is...Holy fuck."

23:56:38 Shule grins wickedly.

23:56:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Love, where did you disappear to?"

23:56:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not at all."

23:57:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hey, just running some errands."

23:57:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew sighs.

23:57:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ah no problem, know how that is."

23:57:21 Evenia sighs sadly. "Time for me to make my exit, I suppose?"

23:57:28 I don't see that here.

23:57:52 "Sorry, I should go soon." You smile at Evenia Callseah. "Lily is asking about me."

23:57:57 You wrap your arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

23:58:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I jsut put the asteroid processor for 285 together. I have to look at the timing for when it's going offline. May need your assistance but we'll see."

23:58:15 You whisper to Evenia Callseah.

23:58:28 Evenia Callseah sighs. "This being the other woman thing is gonna be hard."

23:58:36 Evenia Callseah smiles at you. "It really was."

23:58:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, ok. I'd be happy to help where I can."

23:59:03 You say to Evenia, "I'm sorry. I knew it might be."

23:59:29 Evenia Callseah shrugs. "I just gotta take what I can get I guess."

23:59:37 You squeeze Evenia Callseah affectionately.

23:59:42 You kiss Evenia Callseah on the lips.

23:59:51 Evenia doesn't meet your eyes as she quickly gets dressed.
