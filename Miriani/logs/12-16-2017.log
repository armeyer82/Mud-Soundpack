00:39 A letter

Kitty,
I realized that I had a bit more to say. I've had time to think about your letter and such. First of all, I'm not saying we shouldn't have sex as friends, because I don't find you still attractive or don't still care about you. The opposite is true.
I would love to just jump into your arms, strip you, ravish you, and make passionate love to you. I have undressed you in my mind countless times the last couple of days. I just seriously wonder about long-term emotional effects. 
For example, what if other females make advances on me. I'm not saying that I'd want to sleep with every one of them. Actually, most  likely very few of them and it won't even probably be an issue as most females don't even flirt with me. However, what if I or you want to spend some time with someone of the opposite sex? Even if it's just give them hugs, or even cuddling up to them a little bit? Is one of us going to get jealous? I would think that we might. Especially if we're sexually involved with one another.
However, if you are truly willing to try to work through these concerns, I'm willing to consider this kind of arrangement. If I didn't honestly care about you, I'd just agree and not worry how you'd feel or anything. Truth is, I do and I still and always will think of you as a very sexy woman.
So let's talk. I don't think it's right for me to say I love you while I'm asking for just friendship. You're an amazing woman and I still 
00:39 cherish every moment we have together.
So again, let's discuss things and hopefully we can come to an agreement. 
Tibo

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kalista the droid here.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.

01:24 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

01:24 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

01:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

01:25 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."
You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

01:25 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:25 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

01:25 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

01:25 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

01:25 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

01:25 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

01:25 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

01:25 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

01:25 The five-person transverser "Ikezuki" has jumped into the sector.

01:25 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:25 The ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion" has jumped into the sector.

01:25 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

01:25 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

01:25 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

01:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

01:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:25 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "Let's just take this one day at a time ok?"

01:40 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "And I truly appreciate that. Like I said, I just don't want you to get hurt or jealous again if I overly flirt with another female. Honestly, even if I flirt, or whatever. I'm not going to have sex with every girl I flirt with. I'd just like to avoid jealousy issues if we can. I mean, I know they will be there probably, but maybe we can work through them."

   (6:25 p.m.) [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "Let's just take this one day at a time ok?"
   (6:27 p.m.) [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "I appreciate your understanding where I was coming from with respect to amore and I'm glad she is being sincere. It just seems she has been very focused upon you and I just felt it would be an entree for her to be all sympathetic and take over. That does happen. Anyway, I understand and accept what you've said about her."
   (6:30 p.m.) [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "I believe we can work through this and come to some terms at least. My thought is that had we never been involved before, then no, I wouldn't likely want any other involvement. As I say, Let's take this as it comes. I just so miss you."
   (6:31 p.m.) [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "I mean if we had never been involved intimately before then it would be different, that's all."

01:49 [Private | Kitty Mars] You transmit, "Like I said in the letter, it has nothing to do with whether or not I'm attracted to you. So, I guess the question is, should we move forward as just friends, but be willing to be intimate?"

01:50 #$#soundpack_pong

01:50 #$#soundpack_lag 108

01:50 [Private | Kitty Mars] Kitty Mars transmits, "I've said before, I really don't mind it if you flirt or hug or are friendly. What I do mind is your having an affair and it creating separation and especially if I am unaware of what is driving you away or what is getting between us. I'm not as likely as you are to be over-affectionate towards other men. As I have said, I'll kiss Matt on the cheek and hug him but that doesn't mean we're going to be more intimate as we never have been. I believe Matt and I are like brother and sister."

Dear Miriam,
I have spent the last couple days thinking deeply about my situation and what I did to get me here. I firmly believe that I am not at the time in my life where I can be in a truly committed relationship. Too many things are causing turmoil right now for me and I don't want to hurt anyone anymore.
Therefore, I am just going to stay single for now. I told Kitty the same thing so I promise I'm not just saying this to be with her. She didn't take it very well either.
I care so much about you and still think you are such an amazing person despite what anyone else says. I cherish every moment we spent together. I can understand if you hate me for my decision. However, I will not leave our baby. I will visit you and the baby as much as I possibly can.
I still have and will have very very affectionate thoughts about you and I understand if you are not comfortable with very much affection from me. Just know that I still find you very attractive and sexy! I know I know. It's probably not very appropriate to write that here, but I'm trying to be truthful with you.
Just so you know, I will be leaving again with Kitty to go rescue her ship as a friend. It was my fault that the ship got stranded out there in the first place so I feel that I owe her at least that much. Please, if you can find it in your heart not to hate me, I would love to see you as often as I can to see how the baby is doing. Take care.

02:22 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:22 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

02:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:22 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:22 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

I am both an eviscerator and battlecruiser pilot, and I have fought thousands of praelor ships over my career. Until recently, we could only fight the standard combat drones using our simulators. this left us with an inaccurate representation of how real battles with Praelor ships would feel on all but the smallest of ship types. Now that we have updated software that allows the addition of up to ten different custom drone configurations, I have come up with what I believe to be accurate drone configurations to simulate Praelor ships using our simulators. It is important that we get an accurate feel for how things will be if we are going to practice for the day we have our own ships, whatever the types we might choose to use to defend our space from the Praelor Ontanka faction, and to strike aggressively at them. to that end, here is my list of drone names and configuration settings for many of the Praelor ship types. If anyone believes my settings to be in error, I invite them to come up with changes. It is important that pilots of all alliances work together.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kali

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kali
10:37 sta the droid here.
You can go south and out.

10:37 You peer out and see...

10:37 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

10:37 You must stand up first.

10:37 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

10:37 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

10:38 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the five-person transverser "Defying Gravity", the ten-person battlecruiser "Temporal Incursion", the eight-person gunship "Blue Star", and the one-person flitter "Hello World" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Lia the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid,

The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kalista the droid here.
You can go south and out.

10:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."
The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

10:53 The ship is already in space.

10:53 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

10:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

10:53 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

10:53 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

10:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

10:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

10:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

10:54 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

10:54 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming 
11:05 red security drone, Kalista the droid, and a jet black box with a glowing snowflake on top here.
You can go south and out.

11:05 You don't see that here.

11:05 You pick a jet black box with a glowing snowflake on top up off of the ground.

11:05 You discretely interface a jet black box with a glowing snowflake on top with the ship's life support system, bypassing a number of safety and security restrictions in the process.

11:05 The computer announces, "Resetting atmospheric controls to NPS..."

11:05 I don't understand that.

11:05 You carefully replace a heavy panel back on the wall, concealing the exposed equipment.

["Intergalactic Battle Taxi" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a tapestry depicting an orange dog lying on the sofa with a bone hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. The blast door leading south is closed. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an elegant dark blue water sofa with several pillows scattered across it, a heart-shaped light blue glass coffee table with a blue violet pillar candle sitting on top of it, an internal stun turret, a yellow trash can, a large soft lemon yellow pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an enormous aqua beanbag chair, and a decorative glass fountain with a stream of water flowing from the upright lance of a cavalryman here.

["Intergalactic Battle Taxi" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. You see a tapestry depicting an orange dog lying on the sofa with a bone hanging on the wall. A panel has been removed from the wall, revealing a vast assortment of wiring and other equipment. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. The blast door leading south is closed. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an elegant dark blue water sofa with several pillows scattered across it, a heart-shaped light blue glass coffee table with a blue violet pillar candle sitting on top of it, an internal stun turret, a yellow trash can, a large soft lemon yellow pet bed with turquoise blankets inside it, an enormous aqua beanbag chair, and a decorative glass fountain with a stream of water flowing from the upright lance of a cavalryman here.

Dear Tibo,
I read your lore file and it breaks my heart, again. I was almost sure that we would start over again, that we will have a family, that our child will grow up with its dad by its side. I thought you still love me, the day we spent together showed me that, well, I thought it did. And now you tell me that, and you tell me that you told kitty the same thing, that means that she thinks she has a chance again, one day, maybe you told her the affectionate feelings stuff too, and who knows what else. I don't know how I shall feel now. I feel rage and emtpiness and all I want to do is cry and be alone. I think it was stupid to think that I could have found love again, the love of my life. All i know is, I have nothing if I don't have you.

16:36 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kalista the droid here.
You can go south and out.

16:36 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet 
16:36 medical drone, a compact black security drone, Am the droid, a sleek black hovercraft, a transparent blue security drone, a transparent pink medical drone, Kara the droid, Katherine the droid, Mekensie the droid, Kitty the droid, Ham the droid, and Lamb the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.

16:36 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

16:36 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Alpha."

16:37 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

16:37 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.
A gentle computerized voice announces, "The one-person expediter "Dolphin" has been cleared for relocation to Docking Bay Gamma."

18:52 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

18:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:14 A youthful priestess smiles and says, "Dear friends, we are gathered to honor and witness the love between Moiraine Soto and Erik Yobi, and to join them in bonded bliss. Be not mistaken friends, love is not to possess or imprison, nor to lose one's self in another. Love is to join and separate, to walk alone and together, to find a laughing freedom that lonely isolation does not permit. Love only endures when it moves like waves, receding and returning gently or passionately, or moving lovingly like the tide in the moon's own predictable harmony, because finally, despite scars or fears, they are openly free to be who they really are - and always secretly were. This is what we celebrate today."

19:14 A youthful priestess turns to Moiraine and says solemnly, "Moiraine Soto, will you take vows here before all of us which symbolize the manifested vows you have already made and will continue to make to each other throughout your lives?"

19:28 Jack Mason says, "I would like to be bonded."

19:28 A youthful priestess smiles and says, "Dear friends, we are gathered to honor and witness the love between Jack Mason and Dora West, and to join them in bonded bliss. Be not mistaken friends, love is not to possess or imprison, nor to lose one's self in another. Love is to join and separate, to walk alone and together, to find a laughing freedom that lonely isolation does not permit. Love only endures when it moves like waves, receding and returning gently or passionately, or moving lovingly like the tide in the moon's own predictable harmony, because finally, despite scars or fears, they are openly free to be who they really are - and always secretly were. This is what we celebrate today."

20:54 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

20:54 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."
You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

20:54 There are no ships here.

20:54 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

20:54 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

20:54 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

20:54 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

20:54 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

21:33 Jenaia the droid

21:33 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is also wearing a shiny gold metal star keychain.
She is carrying an old oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen in her left hand.
