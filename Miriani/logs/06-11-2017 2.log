00:00:04 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:00:05 Morris Corlew looks at Vernos Bailey and shrugs. "Go on up there."

00:00:05 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

00:00:20 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, you won't be in the way if there's only the two of you."

00:00:25 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

00:00:26 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

00:00:26 Vernos Bailey strolls south.

00:00:27 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

00:00:29 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

00:00:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:00:34 Eli Grey says, "Not sure how many can actually stand in there until it becomes a problem."

00:00:40 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

00:00:40 Ather Jammoa says, "2."

00:00:55 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

00:00:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "No problem that an elbow to the gut cannot fix."

00:01:02 Ather Jammoa grins.

00:01:07 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:01:09 Morris Corlew chuckles.

00:01:13 Lily Kaise says, "Others can also stand but if anybody moves..."

00:01:14 Emily Ford asks, "AD?"

00:01:14 Eli Grey says, "But that control room up there has that little half-deck observation area to stand in, should be able to fit more than two in that particular room."

00:01:19 Morris Corlew looks at Emily Ford and shrugs.

00:01:20 Eli Grey shrugs.

00:01:26 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

00:01:27 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec shrugs helplessly.

00:01:37 Luja Garland takes a few more spoonfuls of a hot cup of chicken noodle soup.

00:01:37 Ather Jammoa says, "It doesn't. Be disheartened."

00:01:42 Lily Kaise says, "You'd certainly think so."

00:01:50 Emily Ford says, "Admiral, adjustment to appearance."

00:01:55 Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

00:02:01 Eli Grey glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:02:16 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

00:02:19 Ather Jammoa glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:02:23 Morris Corlew says, "Added."

00:02:40 Luja Garland glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:02:45 Emily Ford asks, "Additional?"

00:02:59 Ather says to Emily, "What I was thinking too."

00:03:17 Emily Ford says, "All his extras he came back from that venture with."

00:03:29 Emily Ford says, "I just thought his whistling robot control was cool."

00:03:37 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

00:03:42 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:03:47 Emily Ford says, "Added."

00:03:52 A gust of wind catches the island, sending it off in a new direction.

00:03:52 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

00:04:07 "Whistling robot control?" Morris Corlew looks at Emily Ford thoughtfully.

00:04:16 Morris Corlew asks, "Like...like Anfisa and the warbling?"

00:04:17 Emily stops pacing for a moment.

00:04:23 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

00:04:30 Aisling the Fox looks at Morris Corlew thoughtfully.

00:04:37 Emily Ford says, "He whistled to make his robot do stuff."

00:04:58 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

00:05:00 Morris Corlew nods. "Similar then."

00:05:18 Emily rubs the back of her neck.

00:06:15 A gust of wind catches the island, sending it off in a new direction.

00:06:15 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

00:06:19 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

00:06:27 The outcropping veers suddenly.

00:06:28 Eli Grey says, "Just about there."

00:06:44 A gust of wind catches the island, sending it off in a new direction.

00:06:45 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

00:06:52 Ather Jammoa says, "Wow, steper elevation than we thought."

00:07:01 Ather Jammoa says, "There we go, should get him in."

00:07:05 Anfisa of Marzore asks, "What did you say about me?"

00:07:10 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

00:07:11 A pair of stars orbit together here around their combined center of mass. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Planets in binary systems are generally not large and are in unstable orbits, but a few small rocky planets may exist.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

00:07:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Interesting enough."

00:07:26 Morris says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Just...mentioned the warbling thing...when they mentioned James whistling to his robot."

00:07:29 Eli says to Anfisa of Marzore, "The only thing I said, was "Anfisa is good with laser!""

00:07:40 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

00:07:47 Emily Ford glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

00:07:47 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

00:07:55 Anfisa of Marzore says, "It is a perfectly normal way of communication."

00:07:59 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings stares in apparent awe at a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

00:08:03 Eli Grey smiles.

00:08:06 Ather says to Nissi, "Should we start charging? Or wait until the probe is out."

00:08:09 Eli Grey says, "Science time."

00:08:11 Eli Grey roams south.

00:08:16 Ather Jammoa says, "Probably wait for the probe."

00:08:18 Ather Jammoa says, "Woo probe."

00:08:23 Morris nods slowly to Anfisa of Marzore.

00:08:26 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:08:32 Emily Ford says, "I don't think they activated the planetary scan."

00:08:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Can't see that from here."

00:08:45 Emily Ford says, "Oh."

00:08:45 Morris Corlew says, "Nope."

00:08:48 Emily Ford nods.

00:08:49 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

00:08:50 Nissi Valdaire says, "Get all the probes out."

00:08:50 Nissi Valdaire presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

00:08:57 Nissi Valdaire stands up from a white leather sofa.

00:09:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Mass probing."

02:53:46 You hear a solid thud as a ship sets down in the docking bay.

02:55:22 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:56:50 Emily Ford's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was asking if you wanted the ship sent off on a different heading."

02:57:00 Emily Ford's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Or as we were."

02:57:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Seems we are gonna look for the hot gas of a pre-stellar."

02:57:20 Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

02:57:28 Ather Jammoa sits down on a white leather sofa.

02:58:03 Lily Kaise nods.

02:58:07 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

02:58:17 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the south.

02:58:25 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

02:58:32 Melinda Michaels taps Nissi Valdaire. "Ford wants to know if you wish to change headings."

02:58:34 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:58:36 Morris says to Melinda, "Howdy."

02:58:39 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm getting all the action!"

02:58:43 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Woo."

02:58:44 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:58:44 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:58:44 The blast chamber shuts down, as the ship is no longer in a sector.

02:58:46 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

02:58:46 The starship has left a unique area of space.

02:58:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Guess she doens't now."

02:58:50 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Why would we change headings?"

02:58:54 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

02:58:57 Melinda Michaels says, "I dunno, she asked."

02:58:59 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:59:00 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

02:59:05 Emily Ford's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And decent speed."

02:59:09 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We might be too close to the dread Downward Clan."

02:59:10 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:59:15 I don't see that here.

02:59:15 Morris Corlew laughs.

02:59:18 I don't see that here.

02:59:20 Ather Jammoa grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

02:59:29 I don't see that here.

02:59:39 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Up to 28 charge now so good to go until we stop again."

03:00:02 Lily Kaise nods.

03:00:06 You nod.

03:00:13 Lily Kaise says, "It stopped when we left the sector."

03:00:15 Eli Grey roams in from the south.

03:00:18 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:00:29 Emily Ford asks, "Controversy?"

03:00:29 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:00:34 Lily Kaise says, "Naa."

03:01:01 Eli Grey says to Emily, "That's what I said."

03:01:01 Aisling the Fox glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

03:01:03 Lily Kaise says, "Just go with whatever."

03:01:10 Eli Grey says, "That last bit doesn't really make sense to me at all."

03:01:37 Eli says to Morris, "Oh.. here I forgot to bring this back."

03:01:39 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:01:39 Eli Grey removes a green bar of mint-scented soap from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

03:01:42 Eli Grey gives a green bar of mint-scented soap to Morris Corlew.

03:01:45 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey.

03:01:55 Morris says to Eli, "You won't need it for the rest of the trip?"

03:01:57 Eli says to Morris, "Thanks."

03:02:09 Eli Grey asks, "Well. I might, but don't you need it?"

03:02:10 Morris Corlew gives a green bar of mint-scented soap to Eli Grey.

03:02:12 Morris Corlew says, "Nah."

03:02:16 Eli Grey sniffs at Morris Corlew. You can only wonder what's so interesting.

03:02:17 Morris Corlew says, "It's a bar that never been used."

03:02:22 Eli Grey puts a green bar of mint-scented soap in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

03:02:22 Morris Corlew says, "I have a couple packed."

03:02:24 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:02:25 Nissi Valdaire sniffs at herself.

03:02:25 Lily Kaise glides south.

03:02:29 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

03:02:34 Eli Grey sniffs at Ather Jammoa. You can only wonder what's so interesting.

03:02:46 Emily Ford says, "I'm going for a shower now."

03:02:50 Emily Ford slinks south.

03:02:52 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.

03:02:55 You take a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards White Zinfandel.

03:13:13 Emily says to Eli, "Yeah, it was what I wore at one of the Cats anniversary parties."

03:13:16 Rogue Romano examines a small hot chocolate dispenser robot for a moment.

03:13:18 Rogue Romano presses a shiny red button on a small hot chocolate dispenser robot and helps herself to a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

03:13:28 Melinda Michaels says, "All the chocolate."

03:13:31 Morris Corlew finishes off a deluxe double vanilla milkshake in a tall glass.

03:13:36 Rogue Romano says, "Mmhmm."

03:13:36 Morris Corlew gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:13:39 Emily Ford says, "I served drinks at that one."

03:13:52 Rogue Romano sits down on a large dark purple and pale yellow flowered floor pillow.

03:13:54 Eli says to Emily, "Lookin good, although I think I kinda liked the shipsuit look better."

03:13:58 Eli Grey grins.

03:14:03 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

03:14:20 Emily says to Eli, "I need to wash the shipsuit before I can wear it again, it's all sooty."

03:14:28 Emily Ford smiles.

03:14:34 Emily Ford takes a bite of a B.L.T. sandwich.

03:14:37 Eli Grey nods to Emily Ford.

03:14:48 Rogue Romano asks, "Speakin' of which. Is there a wash and dry on the ship?"

03:14:50 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

03:14:50 A Tardick lizard named Thor turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:14:58 Emily Ford says, "There's one back in the docking bay."

03:15:04 Rogue Romano says, "Oh okay."

03:15:46 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:15:47 Morris Corlew lopes south.

03:15:54 Emily Ford takes a bite of a B.L.T. sandwich.

03:16:11 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

03:16:12 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:20:48 Jason Rat jogs in from the south.

03:20:53 Morris Corlew waves to Jason Rat.

03:20:56 Jason Rat waves.

03:21:11 Jason Rat asks, "How many planets were there?"

03:21:15 Morris Corlew says, "3."

03:21:22 Jason Rat nods.

03:21:50 Aisling the Fox stands up from a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

03:21:53 Aisling the Fox wraps her arms around Jason Rat, pulling him close.

03:21:55 Aisling the Fox kisses Jason Rat.

03:21:57 Jason Rat wraps his arms around Aisling the Fox, pulling her close.

03:21:59 Jason Rat kisses Aisling the Fox.

03:22:02 Jason Rat sits down on a white leather sofa.

03:22:04 Jason Rat exclaims, "Hi hi!"

03:22:28 Jason says to Aisling, "How are you?"

03:22:49 Aisling the Fox says, "Tired."

03:22:54 Jason Rat says, "Awh."

03:22:54 Aisling the Fox says, "I hate shoveling."

03:23:05 Jason Rat says, "It does suck, yes."

03:23:28 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

03:23:33 Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:24:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We did not wait for full charge, too many exciting things await."

03:24:42 Rogue Romano grins.

03:25:56 Jason Rat asks, "How much did we charge?"

03:25:59 Emily Ford says, "Order a fleet of shovelbots."

03:26:04 Morris Corlew asks, "20% maybe?"

03:26:10 Emily Ford says, "Just over a quarter."

03:26:13 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

03:26:50 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

03:26:51 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:28:45 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

03:32:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Speed is of flow is rather high."

03:32:31 Morris Corlew nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec.

03:32:43 Aisling the Fox says, "Zoom."

03:34:54 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

03:36:09 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines curls one of its triangular arms briefly, then subsides.

03:38:21 A Tardick lizard named Thor turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:39:21 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:40:30 Aisling the Fox carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Thor from her shoulder.

03:40:31 Aisling the Fox puts down a Tardick lizard named Thor.

03:40:42 Jason Rat strokes a Tardick lizard named Thor's warm scaly skin.

03:41:05 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:41:22 Aisling the Fox sits down on a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

03:43:59 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:45:41 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

03:47:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Speeding away to the next planets."

03:47:16 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

03:47:51 A Tardick lizard named Thor settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

03:48:35 Aisling the Fox nods.

03:49:39 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:49:40 Morris Corlew lopes west.

03:49:43 Morris Corlew lopes in from the west.

03:49:45 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:49:55 Morris Corlew puts down a traditional ouija board.

03:50:09 Morris Corlew glances at everyone in the room.

03:50:36 Jason Rat says, "Na. I'll go back to bed if you start playing with that thing."

03:50:40 Morris Corlew laughs.

03:50:43 Morris Corlew says, "Come on."

03:50:50 Rogue Romano asks, "Erm, what is that?"

03:51:00 Jason shakes his head. "No."

03:51:10 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

03:51:21 Morris Corlew glances around nervously and, uh, doesn't push the pointer of a traditional ouija board even a little. Really. It spells out "JASON PLAY WITH ME."

03:51:40 Morris says to Rogue, "Ouija board."

03:51:46 Jason Rat stands up from a white leather sofa.

03:51:49 Jason Rat jogs south.

03:51:51 Morris says to Rogue, "To uh..."

03:51:53 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

03:51:54 Rogue Romano says, "Okay? I got that much."

03:51:56 Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings.

03:52:07 Morris Corlew asks, "Is he...?"

03:52:26 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

03:52:38 Melinda Michaels glances around nervously and, uh, doesn't push the pointer of a traditional ouija board even a little. Really. It spells out "crying over the Rat man."

03:52:44 Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:52:45 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:53:08 Morris Corlew begins using a traditional ouija board. The pointer rapidly moves across the board before coming to rest on 4.

03:53:19 Morris Corlew begins using a traditional ouija board. The pointer rapidly moves across the board before coming to rest on M.

03:53:22 Melinda Michaels asks, "These are supposed to bring bad spirits or something?"

03:53:26 Morris Corlew asks, "4M...it givin a time?"

03:53:30 Morris says to Melinda, "Nah. Just a game."

03:53:35 Rogue Romano asks, "Bad spirits?"

03:53:37 Melinda says to Morris, "Supposedly."

03:53:39 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:53:42 Morris says to Melinda, "Well..."

03:53:44 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

03:53:49 Morris Corlew says, "Depends on whatcha believe I guess."

03:53:53 Melinda Michaels says, "I guess."

03:54:18 Morris Corlew says, "But...it's just a game. thought it might be fun to play with in the rift though. When I took Davion James out, we had a ton of fun with it."

03:54:44 Melinda Michaels asks, "Who?"

03:54:49 Morris Corlew says, "Tac platform."

03:54:53 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

03:55:01 Aisling the Fox frowns at a traditional ouija board.

03:55:11 Morris Corlew looks at Aisling the Fox thoughtfully.

03:55:19 Morris Corlew glances around nervously and, uh, doesn't push the pointer of a traditional ouija board even a little. Really. It spells out "What's wrong Aisling?."

03:55:58 Aisling the Fox says, "You should not toy with things that are not toys."

03:56:02 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

03:56:35 Morris says to Aisling, "It's just a silly game. Although, I could see a rift entity usin it to communicate somehow if they had no other way."

03:56:38 Morris Corlew shrugs.

03:56:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh god, now it will."

03:56:51 Melinda Michaels says, "Thanks a lot."

03:56:58 Morris Corlew asks, "Would that be a bad thing?"

03:57:01 Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

03:57:12 Melinda taps her stomach, "maybe."

03:57:16 Morris Corlew says, "Oh...well..."

03:57:18 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:57:23 Morris Corlew says, "Maybe if they coulda told us why..."

03:57:34 Morris Corlew says, "Communication is good."

03:57:43 Melinda Michaels begins using a traditional ouija board. The pointer rapidly moves across the board before coming to rest on YES.

03:57:48 Morris Corlew asks, "See?"

03:57:49 Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:57:51 Melinda Michaels says, "It is."

03:57:52 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:57:57 Aisling the Fox says, "It is if you take it seriously."

03:58:04 Morris Corlew says, "First contact kit for rift faeries."

03:58:04 Aisling the Fox says, "This is making joke of it."

03:58:11 Aisling the Fox says, "You are making joke of it."

03:58:25 Morris says to Aisling, "The game itself is, but...if used under the right circumstances...but generally it's jsut a game."

03:58:27 Melinda Michaels says, "I've heard old stories about those boards."

03:58:37 Melinda Michaels says, "I am assuming Jason has too."

03:58:51 Morris says to Melinda, "I have too, but...used to play with one as a kid and never had anything freaky happen my friends didn't cause."

03:58:56 Aisling the Fox says, "Stories are usually founded upon some fact."

03:59:03 Melinda Michaels nods to Morris Corlew.

03:59:20 Melinda Michaels says, "My brother used to play with one but I was never into it."

03:59:30 Morris Corlew says, "Lights flickerin turned out to be the guy that went to get drinks reachin around and flickin the switch when he thought nobody was payin attention."

03:59:36 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:59:43 Melinda Michaels says, "He and his friends."

03:59:43 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

03:59:53 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

03:59:54 Morris says to Melinda, "The one ya used to chase with your friend's snake?"

03:59:55 Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.

04:00:15 "So my best friend and I scared them with it." Melinda Michaels grins. "They ran off and we could smoke our cigarettes in peace."

04:00:21 Morris Corlew laughs.

04:00:27 Morris says to Melinda, "You were a bit of a rebel eh?"

04:00:31 Melinda says to Morris, "Yes, we were mean to him."

04:00:49 Morris says to Melinda, "Just...don't chase me with ants. You can smoke, drink, whatever. I ain't stoppin nobody."

04:00:50 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:00:52 Melinda Michaels says, "He was the little brother that you wanted out of your hair."

04:01:06 Morris says to Melinda, "Ah...not sure why...I just kinda figured he was an older brother."

04:01:19 Melinda Michaels says, "Rarely drink."

04:01:24 Morris Corlew nods.

04:01:59 "Guess I feel just 'cause I don't do somethin don't mean others shouldn't." Morris Corlew shrugs. "I don't drink often, don't smoke, but hey, if you wanna, be my guest."

04:02:09 Melinda Michaels says, "I haven't smoked in 3 years."

04:02:09 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:02:15 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

04:02:27 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:02:40 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:02:44 Morris Corlew considers a traditional ouija board thoughtfully.

04:02:46 Lily Kaise gives a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:02:48 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:02:49 Morris Corlew sighs.

04:02:51 Morris Corlew picks up a traditional ouija board.

04:02:51 Morris Corlew lopes west.

04:02:55 Aisling the Fox says into the PA microphone, "He has put it away."

04:02:58 Morris Corlew lopes in from the west.

04:03:01 Morris Corlew sits down on a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:03:04 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "It's gone Rat."

04:03:21 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:03:32 Aisling the Fox stands up from a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

04:03:37 Aisling the Fox prances east.

04:03:37 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

04:03:41 Aisling the Fox prances in from the east.

04:03:41 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

04:03:46 Aisling the Fox puts a serving of hot chicken-flavored ramen in a small bowl on an ancient moss-covered tree stump.

04:04:09 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

04:04:41 Aisling the Fox says something in a language that you cannot understand.

04:04:51 Aisling the Fox nods to an ancient moss-covered tree stump for some reason.

04:04:55 Melinda says to Aisling, "What?"

04:04:57 Melinda Michaels grins.

04:05:00 Aisling the Fox sits down on a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap.

04:05:10 Aisling the Fox says, "I apologized and gave offering."

04:05:14 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

04:05:18 Morris Corlew blinks.

04:05:21 Morris Corlew asks, "Apologized?"

04:05:29 Aisling the Fox says, "For your toy."

04:05:36 Morris Corlew squints.

04:05:49 Morris Corlew asks, "For what?"

04:06:04 Aisling the Fox says, "If they were offended."

04:06:08 Morris Corlew says, "If."

04:06:16 Morris Corlew asks, "And by what?"

04:06:19 Aisling the Fox stares at Morris Corlew.

04:06:23 Morris Corlew stares at Aisling the Fox.

04:06:30 Aisling the Fox says, "By not taking them seriously."

04:06:31 Melinda Michaels stares at Nissi Valdaire.

04:06:55 Morris says to Aisling, "Since when did I not take them seriously? I said it could potentially be a good way to communicate."

04:07:05 Morris says to Aisling, "How is that not taking anything seriously?"

04:07:27 Aisling the Fox frowns.

04:07:38 Morris maintains eye contact with Aisling.

04:07:53 Aisling the Fox says, "It is a toy and you were intending to be silly."

04:08:05 Morris says to Aisling, "Is that not one does with a toy?"

04:08:09 A large yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:08:17 Aisling the Fox says, "So we agree on intent."

04:08:22 Morris says to Aisling, "However, toys can be used for serious things as well."

04:08:34 Morris says to Aisling, "There's not one thing wrong with being silly. Gotta have fun sometimes."

04:10:04 Aisling frowns further but doesn't say anything else.

04:10:09 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and violet split wings presses its tiny hands to the glass, its mouth working without purpose.

04:10:14 Morris Corlew shakes his head and sighs.

04:12:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Well."

04:12:24 Melinda Michaels stands up from a white leather sofa.

04:12:25 Melinda Michaels strolls east.

04:12:31 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:12:35 Melinda Michaels strolls in from the east.

04:12:37 Melinda Michaels sits down on a white leather sofa.

04:12:38 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:12:39 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

04:12:59 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

04:13:37 Rogue Romano takes a sip of a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

04:13:38 Morris rests one elbow on his thigh and puts his chin in his hand.

04:13:51 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

04:22:19 Melinda Michaels says to Morris, "Come with me."

04:22:26 Morris Corlew asks, "I am I...in trouble?"

04:22:26 Melinda Michaels says to Morris, "Up, now."

04:22:28 Morris Corlew glances at Aisling the Fox.

04:22:30 Melinda Michaels grins.

04:22:43 Morris nods slowly.

04:22:44 Morris Corlew stands up from a large sage red and slate blue paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:22:51 Melinda Michaels holds Morris Corlew's hand, taking him into her group.

04:22:57 Morris Corlew glares.

04:23:01 Melinda Michaels's group strolls south.

04:23:01 Aisling the Fox furrows her brow.

04:23:12 Rogue Romano shrugs.

04:23:15 Lily Kaise says, "Hey that was... ugly of him."

04:23:27 Aisling the Fox shrugs.

04:23:32 Lily Kaise nods to Aisling the Fox.

04:27:51 Eli Grey says, "Hmm."

04:28:27 Eli Grey says, "Can't imagine why he would be upset. I'd probably be pretty happy if melinda drug me off like that."

04:28:31 Eli Grey snickers.

04:28:39 Eli Grey asks, "Is everything ok though, for real?"

04:28:42 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

04:28:59 Rogue Romano shrugs. "No clue."

04:29:07 Rogue Romano finishes off a small cup of rich hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon.

04:29:15 Rogue Romano gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:29:44 A soldier pops above the trench and fires a few rounds from his rifle before ducking back as the enemy returns fire.

04:30:09 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:32:10 A tiny startlingly humanoid creature with green skin and cerulean split wings stares out of the tank with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.

04:34:09 A small yellow creature in the shape of a three-pointed star with short spines pays absolutely no attention to a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:36:10 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:36:53 Rogue Romano stretches and yawns, completely relaxed.

04:40:14 A soldier pops above the trench and fires a few rounds from his rifle before ducking back as the enemy returns fire.

04:40:36 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:41:00 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:44:10 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with purple petals.

04:47:03 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "We shall find the things."

04:47:22 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Things are important."

04:48:15 The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.

04:49:38 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "What's wrong anyway?"

04:50:10 A medium-length orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light blue sea fern.

04:50:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Everything is always wrong."

04:50:55 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yep maybe."

04:51:36 Eli Grey says, "Let's see how these fuckers like sonic tech."

04:51:38 Eli Grey removes a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

04:51:47 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "What fuckers!"

04:51:52 Eli pops his head up and fires a stream from a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer.

04:51:56 Rogue Romano says, "Woo, big bad Eli."

04:52:03 Eli hunkers back down.

04:52:08 Eli Grey puts a sonic ship cleanliness enforcer in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

04:52:24 Eli Grey says, "I... actualy don't know what the fuckers are.. but I have to assume they're against us."

04:52:29 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:52:50 Eli Grey says, "I hope I dazzled them with some tech from the future."

04:53:55 Eli Grey says, "I'm pretty sure i've seen pictures like this in history books.. I think this is one of the really bad wars from Old Earth's ancient history."

04:54:36 Eli Grey asks, "Any of you Leguers know which one?"

04:55:24 Shule stifles a big yawn.

04:55:31 Lily Kaise nods to you.

04:55:39 Rogue Romano gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

04:55:40 Eli turns to one of the soldiers in the trench and says, "Hey buddy, what war is this?"

04:55:48 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I think it's time for us to go catch some zzzzzs."

04:55:54 Lily Kaise grins.

04:55:55 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

04:55:55 You grin.

04:56:13 Eli Grey smirks.

04:56:13 Rogue Romano smirks.

04:56:15 Eli Grey says, "Goodngiht."

04:56:19 Eli Grey says, "Er.. goodnight."

04:56:20 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Sleep well!"

04:56:21 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:56:22 Eli clears his throat.

04:56:31 Lily Kaise waves and waves and grins.

04:56:32 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Good nugget!"

04:56:38 You say, "Night."

04:56:40 Eli Grey chortles at Cheri Lindbergh.

04:56:46 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Nugget to you all!"

04:56:49 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:56:53 You chuckle.

04:56:53 Lily Kaise glides south.

04:56:54 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:57:06 You can't go that way.

04:57:07 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

04:57:08 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]

04:57:08 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, and an insulated green cooler here.
You can go east.

04:57:10 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

04:57:15 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes off of her feet.

04:57:18 Lily Kaise puts down a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes.

04:57:21 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:57:39 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:57:52 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:58:26 Shule places several gentle kisses on your neck before giving you a lingering kiss on the lips.

04:58:43 An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left leg is soaked in blood.

05:03:15 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

05:03:25 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

05:09:44 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:14:42 You hear a wet tearing sound.

05:15:39 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:15:54 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:16:15 Lily says to you, "I love you Hun."

05:18:25 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:20:08 Shule runs his fingers through your hair.

05:25:21 Shule idly plays with your hair.

05:26:00 Lily gently rubs your back and strokes your hair.

05:27:02 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist..

05:28:36 You kiss Lily Kaise on the smooth skin above her breasts.

05:33:16 Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

05:34:54 Lily says to you, "Nite I love you. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:35:24 You say to Lily, "I love you too. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:36:03 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:37:57 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:38:11 The stage lights flicker briefly.

05:48:40 A high-pitched whine fills your senses.

05:59:14 You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.

06:01:15 The stage lights flicker briefly.

06:05:20 The curtains close, to no applause.

06:05:30 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

06:26:52 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

06:37:21 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

06:47:07 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well pierre."

06:47:09 Rogue Romano's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Bob."

06:47:45 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

06:54:00 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

07:04:42 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

07:05:15 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Goodnight Morris."

07:05:21 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night Eli."

07:07:55 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

07:08:05 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

07:09:33 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Dooooooomed."

07:29:44 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

07:39:58 The ship drifts by a number of bodies lying in a vile, thick slush.

07:50:35 The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle impotently.

08:00:51 The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight with each other.

08:08:35 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

08:08:45 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

08:10:40 The room grows a bit more chill.

08:38:36 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

08:48:56 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

08:59:49 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

09:09:58 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

09:10:01 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

09:10:11 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

09:40:03 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

09:49:42 [MTTS] Ulias: Random idea, you guys should totally add a phone psychic.. or maybe phone horoscopes hehe.

09:50:09 [MTTS] Butchulla: I'd run.

09:50:19 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

09:50:59 [MTTS] davetaylor: I'd prefer things like a shopping network where we could find where to buy things, if we're adding things to the phone, like the directory search but for shops.

09:51:25 [MTTS] Ulias: Phone psychics would surely see civilian pilots as perfect marks heh.

09:51:51 [MTTS] Butchulla: That would be awesome. Specially with inactive pilots and the books we rely on for that not being available.

09:51:57 [MTTS] Ulias: That'll be a million credits for the first minute and five hundred thousand each additional minute.

10:01:10 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

10:11:46 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

10:11:56 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

10:41:47 Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.

10:49:10 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

10:59:23 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

11:09:44 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

11:14:05 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

11:14:15 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

11:39:41 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

11:50:05 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

12:00:25 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

12:11:09 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

12:11:09 Lily Kaise lies back in a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

12:12:10 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

12:15:49 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

12:16:00 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

12:43:18 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

12:53:37 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

12:58:35 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

13:03:56 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

13:14:10 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

13:16:27 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

13:16:37 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

13:46:28 On the shore, a number of bodies are stretched out on burning sand as fire falls from the sky.

13:57:00 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

14:07:34 On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from scored bark and snapped branches.

14:10:12 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

14:10:16 Lily Kaise kisses you.

14:10:19 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes onto her feet.

14:10:23 Lily Kaise glides east.

14:17:42 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

14:17:53 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

14:20:42 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

14:20:49 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes off of her feet.

14:20:52 Lily Kaise puts down a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes.

14:21:00 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

14:33:19 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

14:47:43 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

14:53:26 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

15:03:48 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

15:07:51 You kiss Lily Kaise.

15:14:14 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

15:15:48 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

15:19:41 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

15:19:50 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

15:42:44 You hear a wet tearing sound.

15:53:10 A high-pitched whine fills your senses.

16:04:07 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

16:14:33 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

16:15:33 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

16:22:56 The curtains close, to no applause.

16:23:05 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

16:35:29 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Living Quarters Seven]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a compact red refrigerator, an insulated purple cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated green cooler, a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.

16:50:07 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

16:52:43 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

16:52:50 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

16:52:53 You kiss Lily Kaise.

16:52:58 Lily Kaise kisses you.

16:53:27 You say to Lily, "Hi love."

16:53:47 Lily says to you, "Good day Love."

16:53:50 Lily Kaise smiles.

16:53:53 You smile.

16:54:43 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

16:55:55 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

16:59:28 Not much to see out there.

17:00:22 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

17:09:21 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

17:09:24 I don't understand that.

17:09:28 I don't understand that.

17:09:31 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

17:10:41 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

17:21:00 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

17:24:37 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

17:24:47 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

17:28:28 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

17:54:39 The hoverfreeway goes dark. Only reflectors on the surface below act as guides to your driver.

18:04:55 A hovercar spends several minutes overtaking you. Smooth, cycloptic faces peer out its windows at you.

18:07:16 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

18:09:31 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

18:20:11 A massive sphere looms ahead of the hovertruck, soon becoming evident as a slow-rolling ball of tentacles. The truck moves around it smoothly.

18:22:42 Minor Change: Mess halls and lounge menus now have a maximum length.

18:23:27 [MTTS] something: What I think might be cool and a lot less spammy is letting people devide them by category. So if you wanted drinks you'd only look at drinks and so on.

18:23:37 [MTTS] lunarfang: Does this mean no 300 or more item menus that cut themselves off when you're still trying to read them?

18:23:44 [MTTS] something: No clue how hard that would be to implament.

18:24:01 [MTTS] Squidmind: Orgs get four plus double the number of members.

18:24:29 [MTTS] Squidmind: Menus over that length cannot be purchased from, so now is the time to decide what you want, what you really really want, which we all know is the zig-a-zig-aah.

18:24:39 [MTTS] lunarfang: So an org with 5 members would only be allowed 14 items? Or did I miss read that.

18:24:51 [MTTS] Squidmind: Correct.

18:25:08 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

18:25:35 [MTTS] lunarfang: That's fair. Though I can bet some people will complain. Though that's still quite fair.

18:26:06 [MTTS] Squidmind: It basically means that every member gets to add one food and drink to the menu.

18:26:54 [MTTS] something: Sorry I may have missed this but what about the current menus. Have they all been cleared?

18:27:21 [MTTS] Squidmind: No. It's up to the orgs to decide what they want to keep.

18:28:00 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

18:28:10 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

18:32:51 [MTTS] Ulias: Whatcha whatcha whatcha want?

18:44:23 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

18:45:13 Lily Kaise kisses you.

18:45:23 Lily Kaise glides east.

18:52:37 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

18:55:44 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I had magellan feed all of the fish."

18:56:06 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I had no idea it went into quarters."

18:56:13 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That is if your aquarium isn't on the deck."

18:56:22 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is rather."

18:56:32 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup he does."

18:59:22 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I plan to borrow that from you after my sandwich."

19:03:12 Many people march by on the shore, whipped and tormented by demons.

19:09:42 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I got rid of the extra."

19:09:54 Lily Kaise glides east.

19:10:24 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Luja I am moving my load to the dryer."

19:13:46 Howling, infuriated people inexplicably roll massive weights at each other, tortured bodies straining with the effort.

19:24:09 On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from scored bark and snapped branches.

19:28:54 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

19:29:05 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

You can go east, south, and west.

19:44:23 You sit down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:44:25 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of barbed red tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

19:45:30 Rogue Romano slinks in from the south.

19:45:54 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles/General.

19:46:03 Rogue Romano navigates her metallic yellow touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

19:46:07 You wave to Rogue Romano.

19:46:37 Rogue Romano switches a metallic yellow touch einrophone off.

19:48:01 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is rift drive fixed?"

19:48:05 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes."

19:48:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

19:48:17 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just watching charge go up a little."

19:48:28 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Fascinating, the charge."

19:48:33 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:48:43 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

19:48:44 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:48:44 The blast chamber shuts down, as the ship is no longer in a sector.

19:48:50 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "18 percent now we'll live another day!"

19:48:53 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

19:48:57 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

19:49:07 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

19:49:12 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:49:23 Rogue Romano says, "Woo, off we go again."

19:49:24 You grin at Lily Kaise.

19:49:26 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

19:49:30 Lily Kaise grins at you.

19:49:54 I don't understand that.

19:49:57 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

19:50:05 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

19:51:00 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec moves in from the south.

19:51:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec sits down on a white leather sofa.

19:53:50 Vernos Bailey yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

19:56:35 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:56:41 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

19:56:41 A readout shows Pre-Stellar Object 9372-6769 about 16.8 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northeast and Very Slightly Down.

19:57:08 Aisling the Fox says, "Rift Cat provides."

19:57:20 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "There's that pre-stellar."

19:57:23 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Hmmm."

19:57:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Rift cat only provides poop. It's all about the riftcockroach."

19:57:39 Lily Kaise removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

19:57:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says, "Is true we already got hold full of methane and hydrogen, but still."

19:57:52 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec puts a manual zero-point energy receptacle charger in a small black leather backpack.

19:57:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec puts a hyperspanner in a small black leather backpack.

19:58:00 Aisling says to Ather, "Asked Rift Cat for pre-stellar, and we got pre-stellar."

19:58:00 Lily Kaise puts a hyperspanner in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

19:58:05 Lily Kaise puts a manual zero-point energy receptacle charger in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

19:58:19 You are carrying nothing.

19:58:21  You are wearing a dark blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

19:58:21 You are carrying nothing.

19:58:26 Ather says to Aisling, "Because the riftcat beseeched the riftcockroach on your behalf to provide it."

19:59:19 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Want me to bring us in? I'm just down here shoveling."

19:59:28 Ather Jammoa says into the PA microphone, "You look like a shovel."

19:59:43 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "A shovel? Try The shovel."

19:59:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says into the PA microphone, "Sure?"

19:59:47 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:59:57 Lily Kaise glides south.

20:00:39 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Yeah better stuff unless we're just going to go with what we already have?"

20:00:51 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

20:00:52 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

20:26:51 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

20:26:51 A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startingly like a single unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

20:27:16 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

20:30:17 [Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Engineering Room]

20:30:17 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

20:47:57 
[Starship "Someday We Will Foresee Obstacles"; Shower]
This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the collar and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a s
