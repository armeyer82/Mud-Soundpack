01:40 ["Passionate Blaze" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a sparkly gold frame containing a canvas titled "Immortal Guiding Star" and a small flat disc containing the image of Brianna, Doraleigh, and Ray hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa, a pale cream granite coffee table, a comfortable dark blue recliner with a sleek electronic device balanced on one arm, a wide black air hockey table, an indoor gold fountain with a stream of water flowing from an angel's halo, and three glossy pink security drones here.
You see Alexander West (dozing) (sitting on a royal blue star-patterned cedarwood L-shaped sofa) here.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that 
01:41 the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. The blast door leading south is open. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
A game of Assault is in progress.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall.

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green stat

She has a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her left earlobe and a blazing red star ruby blooming rose in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with sparkly snow white eyeshadow. She is wearing sparkly snow white lip dye on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted creamy white with thorny black roses and adorned with silver crystal feathers and the nails on her right hand are painted creamy white with thorny black roses and adorned with silver crystal feathers.
She is wearing a blood red skimpy velvet nightdress with grinning skulls embroidered along the hem.  She is wearing a pair of soft white horse slippers with built in foot warmers on her feet. She is wearing an eye-catching sapphire blue rose gold belly chain adorned with tiny dangling white glass lilies around her waist. She is also wearing a high-capacity sparkly Lore computer, a spacious cerulean blue rabbit fur diaper bag with a dangling silver angel charm on the zipper, a small well-crafted harp hanging from a golden chain, a moonstone studded gold digital wristwatch with an angel-shaped liquid crystal face, a sky blue reinforced alligator skin leather tote bag with a heraldic cross design stamped on the front and a clasp shaped like a crown, a yellow beaded velvet garment bag with priceless gems lining the openings, an antique white gold engagement ring

["Passionate Blaze" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on an antique white animal fur sectional sofa with reclining seats)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a round mirror with a gold frame, a white angel shaped picture frame containing a white card with a heart border, a wide gold frame containing a heavy textured sheet of paper with "outposts" printed at the top, a tapestry depicting a calico cat lying in a window, a poster depicting a calico cat placing a piece of duct tape on an engineering console, a small flat disc containing the image of a lazy pink hippopotamus, an elegant gold mahogany grandfather clock with diamond-studded numerals, a bright coal painting of a little flop-eared puppy with light brown fur chasing after a blue butterfly, and a small flat disc containing the image of Angel Haven Estate; Wedding Chapel hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that th
