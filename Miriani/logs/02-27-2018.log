00:02 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a dark blue suede co-captain's chair) here, sleeping.
You can go south.

00:02 You peer out and see...

00:02 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the west looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter B has been painted on its eastern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northwest and southwest. An open doorway leads into an enormous steel building to the east.
You see the ten-person battlecruiser "Solidus" and the six-person destroyer "Hexanity" landed here.
You see Bee the droid, Cassy the droid, Weep the droid, Tammi the droid, Mechatron the droid, Chitter the droid, Tayah the droid, Sami the droid, Rollins the droid, Geraldine the droid, Beta the droid, Alphy the droid, Mjolnir the droid, Strike the droid, Sinister the droid, Jenaia the droid, Ham the droid, and Lamb the droid here.
You can go northwest, east, and southwest.

02:13 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a dark blue suede co-captain's chair) here.

02:53 ["Dark Desires" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a well-kept Hale flag depicting a gleaming three dimensional metallic gray crescent moon set against a blank backdrop of steel blue hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.

Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a well-kept Hale flag depicting a gleaming three dimensional metallic gray crescent moon set against a blank backdrop of steel blue hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here.

03:09 ["Dark Desires" Weapons Room 1] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a well-kept Hale flag depicting a gleaming three dimensional metallic gray crescent moon set against a blank backdrop of steel blue hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Delta.
You see an internal stun turret and a black leather crewman chair here.
You can go southeast.

03:26 ["Dark Desires" Weapons Room 1] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a soft golden light throughout the room. You see a well-kept Hale flag depicting a gleaming three dimensional metallic gray crescent moon set against a blank backdrop of steel blue hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a black leather crewman chair here.
You can go southeast.

["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.

12:45 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.

19:25 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south.

20:40 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south.

22:33 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go south.

22:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

22:44 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

22:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

22:44 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 3, 3, 4."

22:44 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

22:44 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

22:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

22:44 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

22:44 You begin the landing sequence.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

22:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

22:44 You release the buckle of your seatbelt, causing it to retract back into the chair.

22:44 You stand up.

22:44 You peer out and see...

22:44 [Shadius; Docking Bay]
This dingy, run-down docking bay looks as if it should have been decommissioned years ago. Some kind of brown sludge has taken up residence here over the years, slowly trickling down the walls and collecting in pools on the floor. Puffs of smoke intermittently roll out of the ventilation system, momentarily filling the room with the acrid scent of burned wires and hot metal. Above you, light streams in from the now permanently open docking doors, providing enough illumination to reveal the areas of the docking bay that have been rusted by lack of care and excess rain. The scent of death and decay occasionally wafts in from the north.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a point vendor, Nya the droid, Goon the droid, Briana the droid, Foxeater the droid, Whynot the droid, Kid the droid, Flappy the droid, Sneak the droid, Mylina the droid, Karina the droid, and Suphara the droid here.
You can go north and south.

23:02 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener, a metallic silver starship simulator, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and Mekensie the droid here.

23:18 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [Lore Tracker]
Via the TransLink network, the LoreTech device "Kitty" reports current location pinpointed at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon.

23:18 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:18 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

23:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sea Turtle, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:18 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

23:19 A clear volcanic glass dolphin-shaped Desolian Sunshine scented air freshener freshens the room with the scent of Desolian Sunshine.

23:19 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:19 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:19 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:19 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:19 > (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The six-person dart "Sea Turtle" has left the sector.

23:19 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

23:19 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:19 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

23:19 Current coordinates: 20, 18, 17

23:19 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

23:19 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

23:19 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

23:19 You can't go that way.

23:19 You can't go that way.

23:19 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:19 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

23:19 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:19 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

23:19 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

23:19 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:19 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:19 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:19 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
