00:36 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:36 There are no damaged components.

00:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Jellyfish, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:36 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

00:36 You will now be able to use non-numeric manual navigation commands. Please see HELP ALTERNATIVE MANUAL NAVIGATION for information about potential pitfalls.

00:36 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:37 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: 6, 12, 2.

00:37 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

00:37 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

00:37 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

00:37 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

00:37 The starship is already moving.

00:37 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

00:37 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:37 A voice comes over the radio and says, "High Guard Command wishes you luck on your mission."
The computer announces, "Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."
You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

00:37 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:37 You press a large yellow button.

00:37 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

00:37 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:37 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:37 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the east looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous delta character has been painted on its western face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and southeast. There is a medical center to the west. The front of the building is made of a simulated brick which has been painted white. A pair of thick glass doors leads inside.

01:55 You peer out and see...

01:55 [Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Gamma]
Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the north looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous gamma character has been painted on its southern face. Wide walkways slant off to the northeast and northwest.
You see the four-person surveyor "Ools Storage" powered down here.
You see the one-person fighter "Will of Fire" and the one-person fighter "Iron Madman" landed here.
You see Gee the droid, Larry the droid, Yelp the droid, Cyrax the droid, Cylinder the droid, Torri the droid, Ketemmex the droid, Ramzi the droid, Angela the droid, Gamma the droid, Nia the droid, Jade the droid, and Shade the droid here.
You see Aaron Dixon here.

01:56 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

01:56 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:56 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:56 You peer northwest and see...

01:56 ["Finish Them" Engineering Room]
Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a soft royal silver woven engineer's chair here.
You see Melissa Castillo (sitting on a soft royal silver woven engineer's chair) and Katrianne Beauchene here.
You can go northwest, north, northeast, southeast, south, and southwest.

01:56 ["Finish Them" Weapons Room 4] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret and a comfortable rich silver leather combat chair here.
You can go northwest.

01:56 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:56 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:56 A loud klaxon sounds as red lights flash overhead.

01:56 You hear a gentle hum as the weapons power up.

01:56 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from red to yellow.

01:56 You hear the gentle hum begin to fade as the weapons power down.

01:56 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:56 Storm of Torment: 7, 12, 1

01:56 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Zander to Bellerophon flight control, somebody's shooting out there."

01:56 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

01:56 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:56 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:56 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:56 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:57 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

Situated on the uppermost level of the spaceport, this enormous docking bay is open to the sky above. A thick shimmering forcefield encloses the entire area including the tall metal gate which separates the bay from a sixty foot drop to the ground below. A troop of uniformed guards patrols between the hulking starships, directing both space and pedestrian traffic with military efficiency. To the south looms the enormous gleaming steel dome of the starship garage. An enormous letter A has been painted on its northern face. Wide walkways slant off to the southeast and southwest.
You see the one-person fighter "Quack Attack", the ten-person battlecruiser "Oblivion", the eight-person gunship "Insurrection", and the six-person dart "Sea Turtle" landed here.

Aparently no one but you has problems with friendly fire. Or maybe one of your many wives, sisters or other family members, well, there's no big difference. If they have problems, they can go deal with them by themselves, because you are not a big help to anyone, the opposite actually, you're a pain in the ass of a lot of people. Instead of making the effort to write messages no one cares about, continue 'pulsing' your wives, as long as you can, and until someone really castrates you. And according to all these messages no one, that also includes me, would ever have some friendly fire with you. Someone should destroy or decontaminate all of your ships, put you somewhere you can't escape, ant beat/stun the crap that your brain produces out of you, so that you stop harassing and manipulating women. Next time your brain needs to shit, go to the toilet please. Thanks.

I honestly think friendly fire shouldn't be directed at a smaller or non combat ship just because, and specially not when the said ship is landing from, or going to something important like a mission, or hauling/atmo. Whatever the word friendly fire might say I still think it's a not so good trick. It's up to every person how they do or what they do, but I thought I would just give my feelings on the matter. We are here to work, and do the best we can.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

12:33 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:33 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

12:33 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

12:33 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

12:33 The computer announces, "A starship and two planets have been detected in the sector."

12:33 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

12:33 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

12:33 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:33 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

12:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

12:37 ["Twist of Fate" Weapons Room 2] (indoors)
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The room is bathed in dull blue light emanating from the wormhole outside. A large blue freestanding fan is emanating a cool breeze throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a hologram of a nighttime cityscape set beneath a panel of clear crystal. You see an emerald-studded square picture frame containing a picture of a spotted leopard crouching in some tall grass hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is traveling through a jumpgate.
You see an internal stun turret, three fuzzy blue security drones, a square heavy glass side table, a black suede recliner with sapphires in the arms, a thick Bear skin area rug, a large blue freestanding fan, and a duck-shaped gold cotton blossom air freshener here.
You can go northwest, southwest, and west.

12:37 Ariela Marin's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "weeeeeee"

12:37 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

12:37 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. A glass candle with a soft golden light inside is casting a warm soft golden light throughout the room. A large blue freestanding fan is emanating a cool breeze throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a hologram of a nighttime cityscape set beneath a panel of clear crystal. You see an emerald-studded square picture frame containing a picture of a spotted leopard crouching in some tall grass hanging on the wall. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the blue tinted window, you see the ship is in space.
You see an internal stun turret, three fuzzy blue security drones, a square heavy glass side table, a black suede recliner with sapphires in the arms, a thick Bear skin area rug, a large blue freestanding fan, and a duck-shaped gold cotton blossom air freshener here.

Four smaller holes are placed at even intervals around the drone's body, presumably used for firing stun or counterstun shots. There is no evident sensory system, though a panel at the top of the drone seems to be used for the loading or unloading of ammunition.

12:51 A chime is piped through a nearby speaker, indicating that somebody has entered the airlock.

12:51 Aaron Blade slinks in from the southwest.

12:51 A fuzzy blue security drone, a fuzzy blue medical drone, Fix the droid, and Mend the droid arrive behind Aaron Blade.

12:51 Aaron Blade slinks west.

12:51 A fuzzy blue security drone, a fuzzy blue medical drone, Fix the droid, and Mend the droid leave the area behind Aaron Blade.

12:51 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

12:51 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Two planets have been detected in the sector."

12:51 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

12:51 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

12:51 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

12:51 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

12:51 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

12:52 #$#soundpack_pong

12:52 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

12:52 Ariela Marin's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "waiting on subwarp"

12:52 I don't understand that.

12:52 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

12:52 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.
You have 461,594,315.16 credits.

12:52 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

12:52 You access a silver portable point unit and note you have 8890.84 license points and 6866.18 combat points.

12:52 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

12:52 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

12:52 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

12:52 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

12:52 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

12:52 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Movement aborted."

12:52 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

12:52 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

12:52 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

12:53 #$#soundpack_pong

12:53 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

12:53 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

14:56 Ashley Valleris
She appears to be a newborn.
This baby girl has delicate, almost doll-like features. She is about 20 inches long. Dark brown curly hair caps her head, the tips of the silky tresses barely touching the tops of her little round ears. Her expressive cherubic face is heart-shaped and set with perfectly arched eyebrows above striking almond-shaped blue-green eyes which are framed by thick and curly dark brown eyelashes. Her chubby cheeks are rosy and dimpled, her chin is slightly cleft. She is graced with a snub nose above full rosebud lips that occasionally part to reveal soft pink gums. Her tiny body is slim, though not without its baby fat. The pudgy arms and legs of this newborn baby girl end in fat little hands and feet, the fingers and toes long and slender. Her dark, silky-soft skin has a hint of sparkle to it and is free of any bumps or blemishes.
She is wearing a long sleeve rosy red velvet romper with a pair of lily white fleece pants and the words "Mommy's little princess" printed in rose gold letters on the front.
She has a white woolen sheep-print blanket snuggly wrapped around her.
She has a warm pink wool bonnet printed with lambs on the front on her head.
On her feet she is wearing a pair of white wool booties.
She is holding a cuddly stuffed woolly lamb with a golden bell around its neck.
In her mouth she has a light pink soft rubber pacifier.
She is also wearing a rose gold double-strand double heart dia
14:56 mond anklet.

Asteroid Hauling
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction:
Now that you've progressed a bit in the game, you may be looking into alternative sources of income and points. Asteroid hauling is one of those sources!
In this guide, commands that you type will be in italics. Variable parts of a command will be enclosed in <less-than and greater-than signs>. So, for example, if I write "move <coordinates>", you would type "move" and then a set of coordinates, such as "move 1, 1, 1".
  What it is:
Asteroid hauling, or "'roid hauling", is the process of seeking asteroids and hauling them back to space stations for points and credits. This is accomplished by landing on the asteroid and attaching anchors to the north, south, east and west of the ship, and connecting the anchors with lines. Then re-entering the ship and deploying the ship's anchor, and choosing a space station to haul the asteroid back to.
  What you need:
To haul asteroids, you will need a few pieces of equipment. You will need:
- An asteroid hauling ship. Purchase one at your local starship store. You'll need a minimum of 10 points and 10 million credits to purchase one.
- An asteroid hauling supply kit. This holds your anchors and lines. This will cost 5,000,000.0 credits.
- A spacesuit. You will need a spacesuit to survive while you attach the anchors and lines to the surface of the asteroid.
Remember to buy a full set, which includes a top, bottom, helmet, gloves and boots. This will cost 1,000,000.0 credits total.
  How to haul:
Now that you have your supplies, you can find an asteroid to haul! You will need to go out into uncharted space to locate an asteroid. You could start your trip from any sector, but it would take an extremely long time to bring the asteroid back to a station that will accept it. Therefore, it is advisable to start from one of the sectors listed at the end of this file.
Take the jumpgates to the sector that you'll be starting from. Once in that sector, move to its edge by typing "move <coordinates>" (this can be shortened to "m"). It doesn't matter which edge you start from, but it is usually easier to start from 1, 1, 1.
At the edge of the sector, switch the ship into manual control by typing "manual" (this can be shortened to "man"). Now move out of the sector by pressing a number on the numpad that corresponds with the direction leading out of the sector. For example, at 1, 1, 1, to go north out of the sector, type "8". You are now in uncharted space.
First, switch the ship back into autopilot by typing "autopilot" (this can be shortened to "auto"). Scan the sector by typing "starmap" (this can be shortened to "sm"). If you do not see any asteroids in this sector, move on to the next sector the same way you exited your starting sector.
Keep moving from sector to sector and eventually, you should encounter an aster
15:11 oid! At this point you'll want to SCAN the asteroid and make sure it's not enormous. Enormous asteroids cannot be hauled. Making sure the ship is in autopilot, move to the asteroid and land on it. Welcome to your first asteroid!
Make sure that your spacesuit is on and you have your hauling kit handy (you can wear that, by the way). Enter the airlock. Now type "cycle" to cycle the airlock's atmosphere to match the atmosphere on the asteroid. Exit the ship.
Your first task now that you're on the asteroid is to attach the anchors and lines to the surface. First, go north of your ship and type "get anchor from kit" and "get line from kit". Now type "use anchor" to attach the anchor to the asteroid. Once it has attached itself, type "use line" to attach the line to the anchor.
Return to the ship and go south of it. Type "get anchor from kit" again, and use it again. Use the same line again. You've now completed one set!
Repeat this for the east-west directions from the ship, and then enter your ship again. Once you are inside the control room, type "anchor" to drive the ship's anchor into the asteroid. Here comes the fun part!
If your ship does not let you anchor, you probably anchored the asteroid incorrectly. Leave the ship, and walk to all the anchors and type USE ANCHOR, this will cause the anchor and line to detach from the surface so you can set it up properly!
Now that the asteroid is secured, you can type "haul" to begin hauling the 'roid! It will bring up a list of sectors. Choose the one you started from, as it will be the closest.
WARNING: While on the asteroid, your starmap will be distorted and full of interference. This is normal.
The ship's computer will inform you of your distance to the space station. If you accidentally chose the wrong one, you can type "stop" to stop the ship, and choose a better sector to haul it to. Soon enough, you will reach the space station and will receive credits and points for all of your hard work! How much you make is variable depending on the asteroid.
DO NOT FORGET to retrieve your asteroid hauling equipment and put it back in your kit! Your anchors and lines will be on the landing pad of the station. Anyone can come along and steal them, so if you forget them, you may have to buy a whole new kit. There are two ways to do this. The first is to manually type GET ANCHOR, PUT ANCHOR IN KIT, GET LINE, PUT LINE IN KIT, etc. But the more convenient way is to simply type USE KIT. This will cause your asteroid hauling kit to attempt to refill itself using any anchors and lines that may be sitting on the ground. Note, however, that your kit will only take what it needs to fill itself. If you have spare lines and spare anchors, you should store them elsewhere, as they will complete your kit and it will not attempt to retrieve anything.
Happy hauling!
WARNING: If you are not inside your ship when the asteroid is hauled into the station, you will NOT be credited.

15:15 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Mercury; Surface Landing Site.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, a hologram of a tropical island projected on one wall, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a metallic silver starship simulator, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, a smiling nanny, Mekensie the droid, Jenaia the droid, and a blue trash can here.

You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:32 You stand up.

15:32 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:32 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

15:32 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:32 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:32 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

15:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

15:32 You peer out and see...
[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see the AIE evacuation ship "Fortuna", the ten-person battlecruiser "Retribution", the five-person transverser "Defying Gravity", the three-person heliogaster "Keoko", and the three-person voyager "Explorer Two" landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, Renamed the Droid, Ess the droid, Anton the droid, Abbey the droid, Bozo the droid, Frosting the droid, Arial the droid, Brantley the droid, Tabby the droid, Ley the droid, Lucipher the droid, Princess the droid, Michael the droid, Tanner the droid,

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room.

15:55 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

15:55 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

15:55 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

15:55 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:55 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

15:55 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.
You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

15:55 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

15:55 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

15:55 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

15:55 The computer announces, "Autopilot disengaged."

15:56 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

15:56 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

15:56 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:56 The ship must be in AUTO mode.

15:56 The computer announces, "Autopilot engaged."

15:56 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 1, 1, 9."

15:56 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

15:56 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

15:56 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

15:56 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

15:56 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

15:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

15:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:56 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:56 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

[Partarirya; Landing Pad]
The large slab of metal which serves as this planet's landing pad has been set in the middle of a tiled plaza. Surrounding the busy landing area, the garishly colored tiles sparkle with an unnatural brightness. High railings and a steep set of stairs lead down from the metal platform, the sides of which have been buried in bobbing balloons in every color imaginable. A sprawling city spreads out from here, and decorating each light post and street corner are flamboyant party decorations to suit nearly any occasion.
You see the one-person cargo hauler "Lack of Greed" powered down here.
You see balloons with happy faces on them tied to various light posts and Rico the droid here.

16:25 Beacons
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  BEACONS [distance | range | nearby | nearest]
Description:
  The beacons command with no arguments will allow you to see sectors, what direction the sectors are from you, how far away the sectors are, and what the coordinates of that sector are.
  Beacons distance will allow you to input two sets of galactic coordinates to get the distance between them.
  Beacons near will tell you the closest sector to your current position.
  Beacons nearest will allow you to specify a set of galactic coordinates and the ship will tell you which numbered sector is closest to those coordinates.

  The beacons command with no arguments will allow you to see sectors, what direction the sectors are from you, how far away the sectors are, and what the coordinates of that sector are.
  Beacons distance will allow you to input two sets of galactic coordinates to get the distance between them.
  Beacons near will tell you the closest sector to your current position.
  Beacons nearest will allow you to specify a set of galactic coordinates and the ship will tell you which numbered sector is closest to those coordinates.

17:02 You hear a gentle pulsing sound as the starship begins an intrasector wavewarp.

17:02 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

17:02 The starship shudders beneath your feet as it continues propelling itself forward.

17:02 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector wavewarp. The pulsing sound stops as the wavewarp drive powers down.

17:02 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

17:21 [Remote Outpost 12; Docking Bay]
This is one of dozens, actually one of approximately 6.4 dozen, remote outpost stations scattered throughout Miriani Space. This particular station is located on the very fringe of the Local Space bubble around Sector 6, and pilots can literally haul asteroids from beyond Local Space to this collection location. The bulkheads of the landing bay are painstakingly painted in a smooth dark grey paint that seems to have an internal luminescence. The landing deck shows recent scuffs and scrapes from remote asteroid handlers as testament to the installation of an automated asteroid collection bay. In a corner off to the side, someone painted the face of an ancient dial clock with the hour and minute hands pointed straight up.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a deep lilac silk-lined all-terrain single stroller patterned with stars, a smiling nanny, Jenaia the droid, and Mekensie the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Remote Outpost 12; Docking Bay. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.

20:20 [Remote Outpost 12; Docking Bay]
This is one of dozens, actually one of approximately 6.4 dozen, remote outpost stations scattered throughout Miriani Space. This particular station is located on the very fringe of the Local Space bubble around Sector 6, and pilots can literally haul asteroids from beyond Local Space to this collection location. The bulkheads of the landing bay are painstakingly painted in a smooth dark grey paint that seems to have an internal luminescence. The landing deck shows recent scuffs and scrapes from remote asteroid handlers as testament to the installation of an automated asteroid collection bay. In a corner off to the side, someone painted the face of an ancient dial clock with the hour and minute hands pointed straight up.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see Remotix the droid here.
You can go northwest.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.

21:56 Starship Retrofit Facility
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
A starship retrofit facility is a permanent structure that allows upgrades to be installed on a starship from the asteroid's surface. This file assumes you've already constructed a retrofit facility. If that's not the case, please see HELP STARSHIP RETROFIT CONSTRUCTION FACILITY.
  Commands
USE: Allows you to begin/abort a retrofit, view available, upgrades, and enable/disable the landing beacon.
STATUS <RETROFIT>: Displays status information, including what ship is being upgraded, what upgrade is being installed, when the installation began, and a rough estimate of how long it will take to complete the upgrade under ideal circumstances.
  Procedure
USE the RETROFIT facility and choose the option to retrofit a starship. The ship you want to retrofit must be landed at the same coordinates as the facility.
  Miscellaneous Notes
 * The starship being upgraded will be put into "maintenance mode", meaning most ship functions will be offline for the duration of the upgrade.
 * If the upgrade should fail or be aborted, the upgrade will be lost.

Stretching out for acres, the field that serves as a landing pad is scorched beyond recognition. Red dirt, heated to extreme temperatures from the nearby sun crunches dryly under foot as people mill about and rush to and from their starships. Every time a starship comes in to land or begins to lift off, huge, billowing clouds of dust and debris are kicked up, making the sky above nearly impossible to see. On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.
