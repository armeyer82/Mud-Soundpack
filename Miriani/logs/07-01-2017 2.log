00:01:32 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

03:33:28 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

03:58:42 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh be right back... dammit one more thing to do!"

03:58:45 Lily Kaise sighs.

03:58:47 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:02:49 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

04:03:04 Lily Kaise asks, "Read the post on the board?"

04:03:12 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:03:17 You ask, "No, I don't think he did. Maybe it let me nominate myself since I already hold an office?"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

07:01:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

07:01:45 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs. "It's true, I was."

07:03:14 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

07:07:14 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo bats at a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker.

07:09:58 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Is there anyway to reassign your NDB?"

07:10:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."

07:10:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:10:36 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sucky, so I guess my sightseer is just stuck with two torus NDBs."

07:10:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Actually, that can be helpful."

07:11:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They give ya two different measurements."

07:11:14 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

07:11:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And ya don't have to account for a spatial discrepancy."

07:12:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I still haven't managed to work out what you need to get the extra long NDB."

07:12:09 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Who are you?"

07:12:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Exploration or expedition-grade sensors, Ted."

07:12:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You ok Caleb?"

07:12:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's why then."

07:13:01 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "My name's The Dragonfly,  sir, and who are you?"

07:13:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Goss's old carrier had one though, that's why I've always been confused."

07:13:03 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Damn it-t."

07:13:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No idea."

07:13:34 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You sure it did just have the short range Torus NDB?"

07:13:52 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It definitely had both, I'll never forget the trip I did in it."

07:14:17 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm interesting."

07:14:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wonder if it's possible they've made changes to the sensor systems that make it so things aren't compatible anymore?"

07:14:54 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Maybe, that's all I can think."

07:16:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

07:17:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "There are times we could really do with the long range on a carrier too, we've nothing else with range like that that we can dock ships in."

07:26:00 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Thinking about stop."

07:26:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm?"

07:26:19 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "What now?"

07:26:32 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't remember what I was going to say."

07:27:19 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Anyone willing and able to me a deep sensing array if Iprovide the parts?"

07:27:29 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh my god I just can't talk right today."

07:27:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yell for Ather."

07:27:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That would be Ather and Ather only."

07:27:52 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "Ather Provides."

07:27:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Also you could try asking Ather."

07:28:08 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, why did I ever give up my blueprint."

07:28:09 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And maybe you could write to Ather."

07:28:38 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Do you guys think that maybe Ather could make one?"

07:28:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Somethin ever happens to Ather, there won't be any new deep sensin arrays."

07:28:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Maybe if you pay his charges."

07:28:58 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "Legends has it."

07:28:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hey, he takes tael."

07:29:10 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I get discounts for being in invaders."

07:29:15 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "He will Eli."

07:29:24 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "There's an idea, I need tael, pity I can't make anything exclusive like that."

07:29:31 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Or I will bite him."

07:29:36 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I need to get one of those too. And so many other things."

07:29:57 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Damn Aisling, way to make Ather not make things."

07:30:01 [General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.

07:30:09 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Can I just not get the array and just watch you bite him instead?"

07:30:33 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Maybe."

07:35:14 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

07:41:55 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Morning all."

07:49:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I had no idea there was a broadcast down there. Wonder who put that up and what for. Huh."

07:49:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's been there for ages, but no idea."

07:49:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We haven't had one up since the ops."

07:49:38 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yes we have."

07:50:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Who's buildin it, any idea? When I put up the 270 chain a month ago it wasn't there."

07:50:31 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Not sure to be honest, I just know I've seen it there."

07:50:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We just recently did it."

07:50:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, we do put one up from time to time, but there's not always one there."

07:50:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "As in. We did the chain last. If that's what you mean."

07:51:14 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo bats at a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker.

07:51:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, I heard that. I let Goss know when the chain goes down because he's the next one responsible for it. That just confused me when I heard it go on emergency power 'cause I thought it was the chain."

07:51:59 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh cool. Sorry, I was confused about what was going down and why."

07:52:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah. I thought the chain was goin down like three days early. Didn't realize there was a transmitter out there."

07:52:44 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Does the chain still end where the op stations were?"

07:52:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes."

07:52:53 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah."

07:59:10 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh,  it's earlier than I thought.. damn I should have tried to go to the graves or something."

08:43:06 [MTTS] andawn: Ah, I see.

08:43:23 [MTTS] Ulias: It is not the period of the manatee.

08:43:31 [MTTS] usfolks: Yes. Previous proteges were assigned to mentors for 14 days. Now it lasts for 30 days.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:12:12 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

21:27:30 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

21:27:31 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

21:27:34 Lily Kaise removes a plain white spacesuit helmet from her head.

21:28:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit 
21:28:22 aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a compact white refrigerator, a clear plastic food storage container, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.
