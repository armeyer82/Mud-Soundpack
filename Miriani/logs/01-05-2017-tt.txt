it. I don't see another one on the temporary stations list."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Is there a spesific command to fill a
sample container with maxwell brain fluid? I can see maxwells in the room, but
filling it normally just gives me water."

up."

then. Probably why I missed it."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Just thought I'd check, in case it was a

Hello,
As you are probably aware, we have a vacant industrial whip position. This is
why I make this call to any pilot of our corps who isn't already in an office to
volunteer to fill this post. Please write me a letter before midnight on
saturday December 17th, that is the entire saturday included, if you are
interested. If there are more than 1 candidates I will put up a vote, otherwise
I will send the name of the candidate to the liaison.
The liaison has made it clear to me that they would really see all offices
filled. Thank you in advance for your cooperation and for stepping forward.
With kind regards,
Kim Saunders

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, an insulated purple cooler, a small purple
trash bin, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and
red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the
humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

[Miriani] [General Communication] Jack Mason transmits, "Anton smells."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "We were left off of
the asteroid station in 288 again. Maybe they thought they were using parts from
starseekers for which we were vassalized but I almost feel it was anan
underhanded thing but you know we can't prove it."

[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Xenological Debris-Burning Temporary
Station from the two-person medium transport "The Cat's Meow". The organization
has earned 807,505.80 credits.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

[Miriani] #$#hjelp
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not in much of a working mode today."
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
