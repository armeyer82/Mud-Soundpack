You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.
You can go southeast.

15:37 #$#hjelp

15:37 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: Type, holding, to make sure you have the key in your hand. If you do, try just put key on keyring.

15:40 [Newbie] Paul Yiobo: How can I hold the keyring? If I use wear it says I am allreading wearing it.

15:40 [Newbie] Anny Rain: Remove key ring.

15:42 [Newbie] Paul Yiobo: Ok, ii just did and I tried put key on keyring and it says that I have to put only keys on it. I typed put shipname on key and it says that I am not olding that.

15:43 [Newbie] Bridget Thompson: Put key on 2.key might work.

15:43 [Newbie] Bridget Thompson: Or put key on keyring.

15:44 [Newbie] Paul Yiobo: I allready typed but it says that I can only put keys on keyrings.

15:44 #$#hjelp

15:44 [Newbie] Bridget Thompson: Did you rid of the one you where wearing.

15:45 [Newbie] Paul Yiobo: Yes I removed it, because it was saying that I am not holding that.

15:45 [Newbie] Bridget Thompson: It might have ben matching.

15:46 [Newbie] Paul Yiobo: Don't know how to solve it.

15:46 [Newbie] Bridget Thompson: Go to a starship supplies store an buy another an wear it an then putkey on keyring.

15:47 #$#hjelp

15:50 [Newbie] Paul Yiobo: I bought an other but it keep saying that I have to put keys on keyrings.

15:50 [Newbie] Bridget Thompson: I just tried it and all you have to do is put key on key.

15:51 #$#hjelp

15:51 [Newbie] Michael Calaway: Try looking at the items to make sure you're matching correctly, if put key on key doesn't work, try put 2.key on key and so on it might just be a matching issue.

15:52 [Newbie] Paul Yiobo: If I type put 2.key on key it says that I am not olding if I do vice versa it says that I can only put keys on keyrings.

17:43 ["Starlight Express" Living Quarters 1] (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows)
You see nothing special. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy blue carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Asteroid Surface.
You see an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows, a small white oak wood bedside table, a high white oak wood nightstand, and a compact silver Lore computer here.
You see Miriam Valleris (lying on an oak wood king-size water bed with a white down coverlet and soft pillows) here, sleeping.
You can go southeast.
