[PA] Chase Marshall: "We have lots of torps now, time to torp 'em all!"
[PA] Bryan Stout: "Holy mother fuck."
[PA] Bryan Stout: "We were down to one reload of chainguns. Let's not repeat
this."
Bryan Stout ambles in from the south.
Bryan Stout ambles north.
The starship transitions into another sector.
[PA] Chase Marshall: "I'd like to see lasers and torps on this ship to see how
it'd work."
[PA] Bryan Stout: "It's been done."
[PA] Bryan Stout: "Room 3 grids out in 3 volleys."
[PA] Chase Marshall: "Probably good."
The starship transitions into another sector.
[PA] Chase Marshall: "Oh."
[PA] Bryan Stout: "8 lasers at once is just too much."
The starship transitions into another sector.
[PA] Ted Warburton: "Depends which ones you use, but yeah, this ship isn't ideal
for lasers."
[PA] Chase Marshall: "So many rats."
[PA] Bryan Stout: "The spinward chainguns worked nice on it."
[PA] Chase Marshall: "Also, maybe weapon room 3 could like fire much more
slower?"
[PA] Ted Warburton: "Do you want them dead?"
[PA] Bryan Stout: "This ship actually has more light weapons than the pincer."
The starship transitions into another sector.
[PA] Sean Sloan: "Its to bad each room can't have different chains."
[PA] Bryan Stout: "The lasers don't do any more damage than the chainguns."
[PA] Ted Warburton: "And I like these chains against anything quick, I get so
many shots in compared to any other weapon."
The starship transitions into another sector.
[PA] Ted Warburton: "Heavy would, but I prefer chains."
[PA] Bryan Stout: "Getting shots in doesn't mean it smacks them as hard as one
shot from a volley of spinwards though."
[PA] Chase Marshall: "High out."
[PA] Ted Warburton: "It does if you don't get any in from spinwards though, that
extra second can really help."
[PA] Chase Marshall: "Feel free to torp anything except adapas, I think we have
enough ammo to pull that sorta thing."
[PA] Bryan Stout: "Remember the spinwards have hull bonus as well as more acurit
in general. 3 hits from your vulcans up there equals one from spinward if not
less. But vulcans are nice against the bolt throwers and escorts."
Bryan Stout ambles in from the north.
Bryan Stout ambles south.
Bryan Stout ambles in from the south.
Bryan Stout ambles north.
[PA] Ted Warburton: "Yeah, which is why I'd pick them for a pirate fighting
ship, Spinwards are good for most beacons."
A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.
[PA] Bryan Stout: "My pincer with the spinwards is just smashing things. Add the
chaingun plant oh no what is this?"
