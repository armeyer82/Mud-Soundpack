  * Fixed a bug where ferries would sometimes get stuck forever.
  * Grouped room poses now support object matching (similar in syntax to normal room poses). Couple of caveats in board post 88151.
  * Similarly, droid components also have what they need to be constructed.
  * Added appropriate supply and demand to produce relativity drives in trading centers.
  * Buying things with no supply in trading centers now fails outright instead of trying to buy 0 units.
  * Fixed a bug where trading centers would allow you to purchase more than their supply.
