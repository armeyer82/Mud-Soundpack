Combat Flying: Concepts and Tips
By Lauren Pittaway
This file assumes that you have read the file (which can also be found on toastsoft.net if you're using a screen reader and can view it more easily that way)on toastsoft.net regarding manual piloting. If you have not read it or do not grasp the concepts in the file, read it until you do. It was written to help both blind and sighted pilots. This file is merely a supplement.
The Basics
1. Choose a center.
Choose a set of coordinates you will base your flying around. You want to lure the ships to a set of coordinates you feel comfortable orbiting. If you chase after ships, you will be performing more complicated maneuvers than are actually necisary. The concrete way we pilots have chosen to prevent chasing after ships is to orbit around a center. It's also helpful for gunners. Many gunners come to recognize certain sets of coordinates as being in range of a center. And if they see you get out of range, they will know when you are moving back into range and have a better idea of what to aim at. (Range is a term adopted among combat pilots that will be discussed later.) It's worked for us and it will work for you, so just do it. Your whole strategy of flying should be based upon these coordinates, even if the good pilot always has more than one strategy. This will make more sense as you read on.
2. Know how to work with 3,3,3, 4,4,4, and 5,5,5. The good thing about 3,3,3 
01:11 is that it's probably the easiest for gunners to lock onto. The downside of 3,3,3 for some people is that maneuvering around those coordinates can make them feel a bit cramped. And sometimes, they'll wind up at the edge of the sector unexpectedly and take damage trying to get out of that corner. 4,4,4 is nice because it gives you more room to fly around without being out of range. You can use coordinates that are common to the 4,4,4 movement such as 6,4,4, 4,5,4, 4,6,4, and 4,2,4, but you can also get away with 2,3,4, 2,4,4, 3,3,4, and 3,4,4 without being out of range. Change the ending number in the above coords to 3 (meaning change your z to 3) and you've got some acceptable 3,3,3 movements. The downside of 4,4,4 is that some people get so carried away with maneuvering around ships that they find themselves really far out on the x or y. You might see something like 7,4,4 or even 7,9,4. You should not be that far out of range. 5,5,5 also gives you a lot of room for maneuvering, but most gunners hate it. Typing out coords that would be acceptable for a 5,5,5 orbit are killer when you're typing using the number row. You should still know 5,5,5 for diffs in case you're blocked too much using 3,3,3 or 4,4,4. It's also excelent for invasions which usually involve killing quite a lot of ships. Don't bother with 2,2,2. If you think 3,3,3 is cramped, 2,2,2 is just awful.
3. Find and use a pattern.
So you've got your center (eithe
01:11 r 3,3,3, 4,4,4, or 5,5,5). your next goal is to make three or four moves that will accomplish the following: move you one unit away from your center at all times (rather than two or three), never bring you back to coords where you just were, and bring you back to your center by the third or fourth move. Some ptterns that have worked for us are 2,6,8,4, 8,6,2,4, 9,3,1,7, 8,4,3 3,4,8, 2,6,7, and 7,6,2. The patterns that require four movements make a box or square shape. The fourth movement brings you back to your center. The patterns with three moves make a right triangle. In other words, you make have a square and then move one unit diagonally to return to your center. Take 2,6,7 for instance, which happens to be my personal favorite. Hitting 2 from 3,3,3 brings you to 3,4,3. Hitting 6 from that space brings you to 4,4,3. 7, which is a diagonal movement moves you one number less on both x and y, thus bringing you back to 3,3,3, which is a possible center.
4. Stay in range of your center.
Generally, we combat pilots consider being more than two units away from your center as being out of range of that center. Beginning pilots may end up three units away from their center if they are one unit away from the ship, but it is better to be three units away in a diagonal direction if you must. That way, any maneuver you make to get back into range will be a movement both on the x and y. Generally, we have found that not using diagonals makes it harder to get back into range. In basic terms, being out of range means you are too far away from your center, and your strategy will lose its effectiveness. Being out of range also makes it harder for gunners to gun depending on how hard it is to type the coordinates of ships using the number row.
5. Orbit ships, yet stay in range of your center.
So, you're flying using one of the above patterns, or perhaps another you favor, and you hear the good old "space is occupied" sound. It's time to orbit a ship. How is this done, you may ask. I find the best way to orbit around ships is to picture them as targets that are not moving. Well, if you think about it, for the moment, they aren't. The other thing I find helpful is treating these ships as another center. Just as you orbit 3,3,3, 4,4,4, or 5,5,5, you want to orbit these other centers of sorts. Obviously, this is done in a different way, because you cannot use one of the above patterns to orbit a ship. So let's go into another description of the word center. Think of the ship as a square with eight other squares surrounding it. One thing you can do is move to all of the surrounding squares and come back to where you started when you're done orbiting around this square (or other center). Another thing you can do is use a combination of straight and diagonal movements to complete this task. Some people use only diagonals. This basically involves touching the sides of a ship but no corners. I love this pattern, but it can be a bit disorienting. Sometimes, you cannot complete the orbit pattern you have in mind. You then have one of two choices. One is to try a different movement without goign back to the coordinate you just came from. The other is to start orbiting the other ship you have just come into contact with. Here is where the pilot's judgement comes into play. Can you orbit this other ship and still be in range of your center? Is it really worth doing so? Can you think of a movement that will still keep you in orbit of the first ship? Of course, we know that ships are moving targets. If a ship does move, which it will, you can choose to orbit it if it is still in range or choose another ship to orbit depending on which is nearer or better for you in your circumstances.
6. Never go back to the set of coordinates you just came from.
Praelor use lasers. As anyone who uses lasers knows, you don't need a confirmed target to fire them, but they also take more time to use than cannons. So, say you're at 3,3,3 and you move to 3,4,3. And say that while you're at 3,4,3, a praelor fires at 3,3,3. With just your luck, the moment you move back to 3,3,3 will be the exact moment that the praelor's laser has hit 3,3,3, thus causing damage to your ship. So, doing such a maneuver is an extremely bad idea.
7. Never stay still for more than a second.
What this really means is if you've sta
01:11 yed still for a second or more, you are staying still too long. I'm mainly directing this at pilots who are doing more than just flying. Staying still can really hurt pilots who are also gunning or pilots doing solos. They're too busy plotting their next move--whether it be the next direction they're going to fly or the next set of coordinates they'll lock onto--that they forget to keep flying. Ships have less of a chance of hitting you while you're moving and more of a chance of giving you damage if you're not. So, always have your next move in mind and another just in case your first doesn't work. Perhaps even having a third move in mind will also help you. But I direct this specifically at the group of pilots mentioned above because it's easier to be a good pilot in combat if flying is all you have to focus on.
Some Useful Techniques
1. If they box you in, change the z.
So you keep getting blocked everywhere you go, and none of your patterns are working out. You're getting hit left and right, and you think you might have to abort the mission. Well, you should be on a dif if this is happening. Mods are generally no problem for the experienced pilot.  Anyhow, if you find yourself feeling this way, most likely, you haven't tried "changing the z". Isn't it great that you're familiar with 3,3,3, 4,4,4, and 5,5,5? Then you'll have no problem going up or down the z and adapting to the pros and cons of each of those centers.
2. Change the z, but keep your pattern.
Say you're doing 2,6,8,4 and you need to change your z. Most people are hesitant to change the z because they feel too much stress comes with adapting a new center. For instance, some pilots fly 3,3,3 and feel too uncomfortable with 4,4,4. Well, you can always try something like, 2,6,8,4, +2,6,8,4 2,-6,8,4 2,6,+8,4... Okay, that probably took a little while for you to break down in your head, but basically the 3,3,3 pilot is now making use of 3,3,2, 3,3,4, or even 3,3,5 without changing the pattern. Or the 4,4,4 pilot is making use of 4,4,3, 4,4,5, or possibly 4,4,2. The pilot flies around a new yet temporary center that is constantly changing. Your actual pattern stays the same. The only thing that changes is when that person chooses to move up or down and what direction they actually move.
3. Use temporary centers.
The advantage of this type of center is that you can use the patterns you know and love while keeping away from a crowded z. For example, if you feel too crowded at 3,3,3 you would move to either 3,3,4 or 3,3,2 instead of moving to 4,4,4. The key is to keep the x and y of the center where you feel comfortable and only change the z. Other examples of temporary centers include 4,4,5 or 4,4,3 instead of 4,4,4 or 5,5,6 or 5,5,4 instead of 5,5,5. 
4. Use temporary starting points.
Here, we don't change our z at all. Instead we resort to temporarily starting our pattern at 
01:11 a different x and y depending on the scenario. I use the term starting point instead of center because we return to our permenant or temporary center after our starting point has served its purpose. For instance, let's say you want to orbit a ship at 5,3,3 but are using a center of 3,3,3. If you do a 3,4,8 pattern starting at 4,3,3, you can easily stay within one unit of your 5,3,3 ship, provided that there are no other ships blocking you. When you have killed the ship, or the ship has moved, you may then return to using 3,3,3 as your center. The key to remember with temporary starting points is to base your pattern around where the ship is situated. Another good example of reasons to use a temporary starting point is when orbiting 2,4,3. In this situation, it is impossible to use 3,3,3 as a starting point and always stay within one unit of this ship, so you are forced to choose a different starting point. I favor a starting point of 2,3,3 and a 1,8,6 pattern. A 3,8,4 pattern would also work here. In our third example, we use a 3,4,8 pattern to orbit a ship at 4,2,3 and a starting point of 3,2,3. Again, we are faced with the impossiblity of finding a suitable pattern to orbit this ship from 3,3,3. We used 3,2,3 as an alternative.
5. Using multiple patterns.
I've seen some pilots--including myself in my early days--only use one pattern. You make some unrelated movements when blocked (most of which you don't even remember la
01:11 ter) and return to your pattern as soon as possible. More advanced pilots try to get away from this strategy, and one way to do this is by using multiple patterns. If you get blocked when you try to hit the 3 in 3,4,8, do a 2 instead and start a 2,9,4 pattern. If you see a ship at 2,2,4, you can do a 4,8,3 pattern instead and still keep a 3,3,3 starting point. If you see a ship at 4,2,4, you can do a 1,6,8 pattern with a 3,3,3 starting point. Using multiple matterns makes your flying more effective. But this might seem a bit alarming for you. You might say, it's too much to remember what patterns are the best for specific scenarios. The best advice I can give in response to these thoughts is to start using one different pattern every time you've mastered the last. Let's say you know that you can't do a 3,4,8 pattern and effectively stay near 3,3,3. Now, my favorite pattern for this scenario is 4,2,9, but you haven't thought of using that pattern or a similar one yet. So you think to yourself, what pattern can I use that will start at 3,3,3 and constantly keep me in range of 2,4,4. A number of different patterns pop into your mind: 4,2,9, 2,4,9, 1,8,6, 1,6,8, etc. So, you pick the one that feels the best to you and use it the next time you see a ship at 2,4,4. Once you've mastered that scenario, ask yourself what you're going to do to tackle orbiting 4,2,4. FInd the pattern that feels the best to you, and then use it. If you keep doing this, you will have a number of scenarios and patterns in your head and will be better able to deal with tough situations as a pilot.
6. Move aim, move fire.
Pilots who are ready to fly and gun or do solo missions are very familiar with flying and scanning, so we'll assume you are too. Well, you know the coordinates you want to fire at and you're staying in range of those coords. You get round time while you're firing your ship's weapons, but you can still do things while your ship is moving. While your ship is moving, you'll have time to lock on to your desired coords. Move again, and then fire your weapons. Sometimes you can pull off locking and firing within one piloting move and not stay still, but generally that won't happen. SO a good thing to remember is to move, lock onto the coords you want to fire at, move again, and then fire your weapons.
7. Mimimal engeneering.
This only applies to solos or pilots who multiroom. If you are a good pilot, you can basically leave your damage alone. If you have time to repair it, go ahead. And a good old rep h or rep sen never hurt anyone once in awhile. But engeneering should definitely not be the first thing on your mind. It's okay to make sure you don't have too much damage, but you can leave eng alone for the most part.
Miscelanious Tips
1. Time verses damage.
As a pilot, you need to decide which is more important to you. Is it more important that you get faste
01:11 r mission times and more damage? Or perhaps you'd rather take more time and have less damage. Neither choice is right or wrong, but each will effect your overall strategy as a pilot. But I'd like you to keep the following point in mind. Many pilots get themselves into sticky situations for one of two reasons. New pilots will often panic when being boxed in or when faced with more ships than they expect. And sometimes, more experienced pilots get overconfident and rush, making costly decisions. Otherwise, they miss the chance to carry out a move that is better than the one they actually perform.
2. Don't forget to salvage!
That "space is occupied" sound isn't necisarily a ship you're trying to orbit. So even when you don't think you need to scan, at least make sure you have no debris in your way either by scanning or even just by typing "sal" once in awhile. Besides, the worth of debris in normal space has gone down from 0.2 to 0.3 points per piece to 0.1 to 0.2 points per piece. Mission debris is almost always 0.3 points for debris. So you'll really want to salvage that mission debris. If you find you have trigger happy gunners, the best thing to do is type sal as much as you can. You might even consider buying an extra salvaging line. But any way you slice it, mission debris is easy points. And remember, only the person who salvages the debris gets the points. So if someone else transfers the debris you salvage, no one gets the points.
3. Scanning verses starmap.
Scanning is better than using the starmap when missioning using a screen reader in general. Any good sound pack you're using with monkey term usually comes with an XML that allows for you to hear the coordinates of the ship you're scanning only a split second after selecting the number of the ship you want to scan. If you're using vipmud and don't have the gag in your script file that allows for the instant reading of coords, pressing control-3 will read your coordinates. Control-2 will read the distance of the ship from you. Just make sure not to wait too long before pressing either keystroke. Using the starmap usually causes a screen reader to report back unnecisary information. Or, you might hear information about a number of ships before you actually find a good target. BY the time you've aimed at that target, it has already moved. Scanning is also useful to a pilot because it gives you a general idea of what your gunners are firing at. You can usually tell what your gunners are shooting at based on the hull and component damage of the ships. Above all, those damage numbers serve as an indication of how your mission is progressing and how your gunners are doing in terms of skill.
4. Using focus.
Typing focus from a cr, wr, or eng room will bring up a menu of ships in your current sector. After selecting the number of a desired ship, typing focus will reveal its coordinates every time the command is entered. Using focus makes for faster blind gunners, but it also means easier flying for both blind and sighted pilots alike. Focus is extremely useful when chasing after ships. (But let's remember not to go too far, shal we?)
5. (for blind pilots only) What happens when you lose your sensors? The short answer is that you can no longer scan ships. This is not the ideal situation for a crew full of blind pilots. However, a mission can still be done. The gunners will have to use the starmap, which is not so bad. I used the starmap for a long time. As the person flying the mission though, you won't have access to the starmap. That's when using your sound pack really comes into play. You'll have to fly based upon the "space is occupied" sounds that you hear. You'll have to assume that any "space is occupied" sound" means a ship is in that space. However, if you're flying a solo, just abort. It's really not worth the struggle, damage, or time it will take to complete the mission.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical d
18:25 rone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a commodity listing here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

18:25 You're already standing. But you lazily stretch to make your foolish mistake less obvious.

18:25 The computer announces, "Undocking from an unknown starship."

18:25 You hear a satisfying click as the ship's docking ring is retracted from the docked ship's hull.

18:25 The computer announces, "Undocking complete."

18:25 You flick a switch to disable condensed autopilot and debris display modes.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras

You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Jenaia the droid, Mekensie the droid, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (staring into space) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.
