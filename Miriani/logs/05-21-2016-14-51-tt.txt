Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small seashell pink trash can, a glossy dark
violet ceramic felo chow bowl, a turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and
a glass-covered top, and a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug
here.

another one or so.
"I gave the robot in Kalliste another bag of chow," you say, "but I should
probably give it another one or so."
"So for tomorrow's trip," says Lily, "I will load this with some trade goods as
we'll have 3 days of charge at least and the chamber is full which should be
more than enough to get us to Hall of Pain and then we'll recharge out there
anyway and then onto Andy's, etc."
"If you want to provide parts I can craft an artifact detector for you to try to
trade on Andy's as well as a compressor if you like," Lily says.

'That'd be cool
You say, "That'd be cool."
"Will be glad to," says Lily. "You have enough force multipliers to craft a few
of those compressors anyway."

So you do want to just walk out forever like that. I can't tell you how hurt and
sad this is for me as all along I felt you truly cared and that you would work
with me if we had issues to resolve. This is not the first time that you have
been so callous over our relationship. I shouldn't be in denial anymore as if
things don't go Shule's way he drops you like a throw away toy. I should have
realized that I was so expendable to you. As for asking questions of you, well i
have and sorry that my assumptions ruffled your feathers but you yourself have
been prone to whining over our alliance that day when you didn't want to go to
Ather's party and said just because you're having a bad day for everyone to know
and to sympathize with you. That made me feel that you might not keep our
interactions good or bad between us as two adults should do. It's painful for me
to delete your key Shule and you know it. So throw in a little more salt on my
wounded heart as I truly feel betrayed now. I learned to trust you and I fell in
love with you only for you to discard everything I've worked to attain away.
I'll get over this in time I hope Shule. You still have the opportunity to show
up in good faith as an adult man and work through this. Otherwise, good by my
love.

    This is a debris-burning fusion blast chamber. It can provide a good amount
of power for a significant length of time. However, it must be kept supplied
with raw material. This model is much more energy efficient than its larger
cousin, but it also has a smaller furnace capacity due to its size.
