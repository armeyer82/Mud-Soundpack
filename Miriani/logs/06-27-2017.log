00:57 [Newbie] Jhonas Andromidas: Can someone help me, please? I am new.

00:57 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: What kind of assistance do you need? Have you read any of the getting started help files?

00:58 [Newbie] Jhonas Andromidas: I'm trying to figure out which organization I should join.

00:59 [Newbie] Lance Martellato: Read each room description, and go with whatever you think your character will do best roleplaying in. It is possible to switch alliances later down the road if you feel like you made the wrong choice, but for the early stages of the game, it doesn't matter a whole lot.

01:00 #$#hjelp

01:00 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: The best I can tell you is to explore the room for each of your options. Short descriptions are given for each alliance that you may choose. You can read also about the history for the alliances on the website, if that's important to you, but as Lance says, you may switch later if you feel you made the wrong choice. The most important part for now is to pick the one that you feel you will roleplay best.

01:02 [Newbie] Jhonas Andromidas: Alright. Thank you. Another question. What's the ruling on consent? Can someone just come up and stab me for my smokes, so to say?

01:03 #$#hjelp

01:05 [Newbie] Lance Martellato: If by consent you mean sexually, policy 2, Harassment, Discrimination, and Threats, should answer any questions / fears you might have about roleplay in that regard. Otherwise I'm not sure what you mean exactly.

01:06 [Newbie] Jhonas Andromidas: Ah, so this isn't some sort of open-PK game.

01:07 #$#hjelp

01:08 [Newbie] Marielle Minnillo: You should really read all the policies and familiarize yourself with the game that way.

13:09 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.
You see a shiny white starship simulator, a dark blue suede captain's chair, a dark blue suede co-captain's chair, and a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end here.
You can go south, down, and out.

14:03 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub.

14:08 [Newbie] Justice Smith: What is a salvage container and how do I get one?

14:08 [Newbie] Marcus Henderson: A salvage container is given to you if your ship is destroyed. You can't get one any other way.

14:09 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: A salvage container happens when something gets destroyed. Apartment, ship, etc. You only get one in those instances. If you mean how to pick it up, ust get salvage or, something that will match to the container. If it was your ship, for example, since your ship name would be part of the name of the container, you could type get shipname.

14:10 #$#hjelp

14:10 [Newbie] Justice Smith: Is there any situation where I wouldnt get one? My ship got destroyed a while ago and I don't remember getting a container?

14:11 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: Did you have anything in the ship? I mean, a chair, internal stun turrets, table, something you dropped on the floor?

14:12 [Newbie] Justice Smith: Yes.

14:12 [Newbie] Erik Yobi: Did you try to pick up the salvage container?

14:12 [Newbie] Justice Smith: Where would it be?

14:12 [Newbie] Erik Yobi: On the ground.

14:13 [Newbie] Marcus Henderson: Most likely on the landing pad you ended up on.

14:13 #$#hjelp

14:13 [Newbie] Erik Yobi: Anyone can pick it up though, so if this is a long time ago, then it's probably gone by now.

14:13 [Newbie] Moiraine Soto: So when your ship gets destroyed, you, along with anyone on the ship and its contents in the salvage container, are chucked into an escape pod and sent to the home planet. If you did not pick up the container in the pod, then it would have been dumped on the spaceport where your pod left you. But someone else could easily have picked it up if you didn't, in which case, I can't help you. Usually, if a ship gets destroyed, the best thing to do is pick up the container immediately while you're still in the pod so that this doesn't happen.

14:14 [Newbie] Justice Smith: Oh, hmm, think someone might have stole it then since I didn't check. Guess I'll go look.

The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun. Worn smooth by the constant movement of pilots and personnel, it features several large metallic landing sites marked by a bright red X and surrounded by safety railings. These are lowered to the garage below as starships are transferred to and from this busy landing site. Five decoratively carved archways lead off from here, and a smaller one to the south covers a staircase leading down to the level below.

23:44 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise.
