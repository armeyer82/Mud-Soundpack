00:11 LoreTech Personal Lore Computer - [File: Final Good-bye]

Kitty,
What in creation? Seriously? I fabricated that whole escape thing? Are you absolutely crazy?
I had to stare and this is what I come back to? More false accusations? I thought we were done with all of this! I guess I was wrong.
I'm sorry Kitty, this wasn't just about you giving me a second chance. It was about us giving it a second chance. Now I see that was a big mistake! I cannot handle going through this again. I have moved my stuff out of the station. I'm not coming back. I cannot and will not tolerate this kind of vindictiveness.
If it will make you feel better, Go strand and stun Miriam, take out your vengeance on both of us if you want, but know that if you harm her in any way, you will be harming an innocent child that did you no wrong. Yes, Miriam is pregnant. Yes, we did talk. She wanted to know why I broke up with her which she had a right to know. Just like you wanted to know the first time I broke up with you. Well, now you know why this time. Good-bye Kitty.

00:12 #$#soundpack environment starship landed | unpowered | safe | light | indoors
["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kalista the droid here.
You can go south and out.
00:12 

00:12 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:12 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Apartment 26860; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kalista the droid here.
You can go south and out.

00:28 [Private | Alayna Wells] You transmit, "I made a stupid newbie mistake. We had just surveyed and salvaged a marine planet and we went to a star in the same sector and I went into the engineering room to shut off main power for the night. I didn't check to see if Kitty had her force field back on. She didn't. She was sent home in an escape pod. So, I grabbed everything I could and followed."

00:31 (Alliance High Guard Command; Garage) Tristina Cantrell slinks in from the northeast.

You can go south and out.

06:23 You press a small button on an independently powered garage control device.

06:23 You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

06:23 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

06:23 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

06:23 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

06:23 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

06:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

06:23 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

06:23 You sit down on a dark blue suede sofa.

06:23 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

06:23 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

06:23 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

06:23 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

06:23 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

06:23 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

06:23 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

06:23 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 12, 8, 3."

06:23 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

06:23 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

06:23 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

06:23 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

06:23 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

06:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

06:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

06:24 #$#soundpack_pong

06:24 #$#soundpack_lag 105

06:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

06:24 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

06:24 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

06:24 You must stand up first.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede sofa)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, and Kalista the

11:52 You can't launch from here.

11:52 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

11:52 I don't understand that.

11:53 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

11:53 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

11:53 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

11:53 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

11:53 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

11:53 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

11:53 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

11:53 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

11:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to land."

11:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.

11:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

11:53 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

11:53 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

11:54 You remove a droid remote titled "Mekensie" from a sleek black leather carrying case.

11:54 You can't put that in there.

11:54 You gently slide a droid remote titled "Mekensie" into a slot on the side of a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen. With a soft click, the remote snaps into place and the screen is filled with a live broadcast of Garage.

11:55 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone
12:21 , and Kalista the droid here.
You can go south and out.

You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim

You can go south and out.

["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, a transparent architectural design simulator, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, Jenaia the droid, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone
23:51 , and Kalista the droid here.
You can go south and out.

23:51 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Madness the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Cat the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet 
23:51 medical drone, a compact black security drone, Am the droid, a sleek black hovercraft, a transparent blue security drone, a transparent pink medical drone, Kara the droid, Katherine the droid, Mekensie the droid, and Kitty the droid here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, southwest, and down.
