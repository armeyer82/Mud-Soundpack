Notice from the Space Defense Captain: I have continued to see a slight upswing
in decoy beacon drops, but there's always room for improvement! I know that Kim
and at least one other pilot are out on an expedition, but that doesn't mean
that we can't fly them ourselves. Right now, the only people who seem to be
doing decoy beacon drops are the person who pilots "starseekers defender" and
myself. Let's do more! Let's even try to organize crews, if possible. I will be
trying to organize one such crew tonight. If any AEU pilots can be available to
take up crew stations, they are welcome to come along. [20:32 11 February 2317

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
