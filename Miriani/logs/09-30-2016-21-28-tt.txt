Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Living Quarters Six]
Crystal clear water fills the fishbowl, and layer of gravel on the floor creates
a natural looking substrate. A bubbling plastic treasure chest in the center is
guarded by a plastic diver wearing a diving bell, and a kelp-like neon green
plastic plant waves around, anchored into the gravel. A large goldfish and
several tetras inhabit the fishbowl, along with a snail. A thick band that
stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship
is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside
the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a compact red
refrigerator, a small seashell pink trash can, an insulated green cooler, a
small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, a clear plastic food storage container, a blue plastic
food storage container, and an insulated orange cooler here.
You can go out.

You blink heavily and then doze off.
The group of tetras zooms around the bowl in tight circles.
The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.
Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties,
you find yourself back in the starship.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
The wind blows without control; the sky flashes with bursts of radiant
lightning.
The wind abates slightly as thunder continues to roll across the plains.

A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in.
As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
Agonized screams are heard within the ruptured earth as fire belches from the
open orifices. The heat from the flames propel the platform into the air!
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
The fires from the chasms dissipate, and the platform levels off.
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.
Flames flicker on either side of the conveyor belt as the air grows hot.

I would like a couple of white ones if it's not too much trouble. If not, I'm
interested in dark purple or semitransparent. Thank you.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and a compact metallic purple camera with a gold fleur-de-lys
embossed on the front with a glittery pink camera strap. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both
forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both
knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Living Quarters Six]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a

A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "How do you remove an ammo storage box so
you can get rid of it if you can't launch? I've heard about putting it on a
hover, but can't pick it up or anything."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Tug the ship up and jettison the ammo
box."

The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startingly like a single
unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass
is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a
glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created
here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Have engineering tool cases changed
recently such that you can't put just anything in them? I used to keep a hull
brush and decoy beacons in mine and I'm getting 'You can't put a hull brush in a
dark blue engineering tool case.' now."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I've never been able to put those
things in there."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "They were always supposed to be an
alternate to the bandoliers."
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "You used to be able to."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
A hairy black and red striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named Araignée skitters
into the area.
Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I don't understand
these readings."
Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What are you having
difficulty with?"
Luja Garland's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm having difficulty
with where to even look."
Akemi Bando's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Each sail has its own
settings. You can check them on each mast."
Lily Kaise glides in from the west.
Lily Kaise glides out.
A hairy black and red striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named Araignée taps his
claws on the floor.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

instructions."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the
loudspeaker and says, "Well, start by putting the mainsail back up."

was at 0 all along."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the
loudspeaker and says, "Ah."
Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like
thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.
The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly
creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with
gashing teeth and glowing red eyes.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Zéro Des Cartes/General.
With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the
tunnel.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new
updraft.
Nekomata the medium-sized blue twin tailed felo wanders in from the west.
Nekomata the medium-sized blue twin tailed felo wanders out.
The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "If I want to buy upgrades for a ship
currently docked inside another ship, do I need to have one or both powered up,
or undock at all?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Don't thinhk so."
[Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "I think the docked ship needs to be out
on the landing pad and powered up."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I put ships in my carrier to upgrade
more than one across the skims from time to time."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "The ship with the docking bay has to be
on the landing pad. Thta's it."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Thanks."
A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.
The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird
replaces it.

Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your
periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy
white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the
distance. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a cerulean blue synthcotton shipsuit and a pair of sparkly white
leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced
plastic phone holster, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the
side, a compact metallic purple camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the
front with a glittery pink camera strap, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly
labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder.
Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

Akemi Bando walks south.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds

The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no
atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large
floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some
alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as

A gentle breeze gentle rustles through the grass, causing ripple-like waves.
Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.
A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in.
As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this
area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the
distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Yep, cases and bandoliers definitely
have been changed. I can't put a wormhole tracer in my case anymore, when I know
I could have before. In fact, there's an old one in there still."
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "What is the command to holster the
phone?"
[Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "WEAR it."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Wear phone."
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok, been trying for long time."
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like
thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.
The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air
before the fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.
Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while
snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in
an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as
the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

We spotted a strange storm, and we got within 10 LGC of it. As soon as it hit 10
LGC, I changed our heading to 0, 0 to avoid it. This was at 3.89 LTC travelled.
Evasion continues, but it's getting further away.

She appears to be 19 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has tan skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and
attractive calves. She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average
breasts. Her face is round and somewhat pretty, with an average nose and dimpled
chin. Her lips are full and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set
of slightly yellowed teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes
are green and wide. Her mid-back length, slightly curly hair is dark blonde and
parted on the side and smoothed back behind her ears. She has neatly trimmed
clear fingernails. She has a large black satin bow in her hair. She has a tiny
birthmark on her neck.
 She is wearing a silky cream jacket with a mandarin collar and an overall
embroidery of green stars, an expensive silver watch with diamond accents, a
pair of silky light blue pants, and a pair of soft light blue suede boots. She
is also wearing a light purple cotton drawstring purse, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small pink quartz crystals, a delicate blue crystal necklace, a
wrist-mounted chronometer, and a metallic green touch einrophone in a black
leather phone holster. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, left wrist, and both
hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar in her right

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Forward Observation]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls
at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large dark purple floor pillow, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in
brilliantly colored patchwork fabric, an emerald green armchair with a hand-made
purple and sapphire star quilt on it, a long table dressed with a fancy white
cloth decorated with an overall gold fleur-de-lys design, a very large glossy
poster of Nouveau Quebec Premier Maxime Roberge giving two thumbs up, a small
cinnamon brown trash bin, a large bubbling royal blue-lit aquarium containing
white round rocks, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a
side table dressed with a fancy white cloth decorated with gold fleur-de-lis, a
black plastic tray of spider chow, a glossy dark violet ceramic felo chow bowl,
a soft square brown floor cushion, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a soft square dark blue rug with a luxuriously
deep pile and thick gold fringe, a small orange ball containing a realistic Bari
horde noisemaker, and a hairy black and purple striped eight-legged ArachnoPal
named Webster here.

Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

I scanned Pierre's egg carton and this is what I came up with in general terms:
Orange eggs contain three-pointed stars with spines. Color varies, as does spine
length. [Sea stars]
Dark gray eggs contain thin-shelled creatures with claws. Color and claw size
varies. [Crabs]
White eggs contain firmly rooted animals with dozens of tendrils. Tendril color
and presence of barbs varies. [Barnacles]
Light blue eggs contain sleek aquatic creatures with fins. Creature size, fin
shape, color and patterns all vary. [Fish]
Semi-transparent eggs contain semi-transparent creatures with dangling tendrils
and a glowing interior. Size, body shape, tentacle length, and glow color all
vary. [Jellybulbs]
Dark purple eggs contain tiny startlingly humanoid creatures with wings. Skin
color and wing shape vary. [Maxwells]
Black eggs contain soft-bodied creatures with many claw-tipped tentacles. Length
and color vary. [Eels?]
Light green eggs contain soft many-footed creatures with a shell. Color, shell
color, and shell shape vary. [Decapodes]

Here is a rough list of the available Eggs from the Aquarium -- I claim no
guarantee herein regarding accuracy or absoluteness of proper Esperanto.
Light Blue - Xenofish (I call them Space Guppies because they propagate very
rapidly/every 7 or so days) they produce different colors, sizes and interesting
fin shapes
Light Green - Aquapede - some call them snails as they have a soft body with a
colored shell and many feet - they reproduce about every three weeks
Light Purple Eels - reproduce about every two weeks - are varied lengths from
short, medium and long and are different solid-colored bioluminescence
Semi-Transparent - Jellybulb - are semi-transparent and different shapes and
colors reproduce about every two to three weeks in such shapes a sperical,
bell-shaped, oval and cylindrical
Dark Purple - Maxwell - - reproduce every few weeks - this is a humanoid-looking
fish with a solid colored body and different-shaped wings such as round, split
and butterfly
Dark Orange - Seastar - reproduce every few months - a 3-pointed star-shape in
solid color. This fish lives a long time. My first one lasted about 26 months.
However they seem to be quite vulnerable in the actual aquarium.
Dark Gray - Snapper - reproduces every few months - This fish likes to snap at
various objects in the aquarium as well as can be observed snapping it's way
along the bottom of the tank this fish is various-sized with varied thickness of
shelled creature with a solid-colored shell and four small claws
Black - Tentacle Beast - reproduces about every three weeks - varied lengthed
soft-bodied fish with many claw-tipped tentacles in a variety of colors
White - Grabber (hangs out in the bottom of the aquarium and likes to waves its
tendrils) - reproduces every few months - this is a firmly rooted animal with
dozens of different textured tendrils

Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion
dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through
the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly,
their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway.
Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever
they part. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large dark purple floor pillow, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in
brilliantly colored patchwork fabric, an emerald green armchair with a hand-made
purple and sapphire star quilt on it, a long table dressed with a fancy white
cloth decorated with an overall gold fleur-de-lys design, a very large glossy
poster of Nouveau Quebec Premier Maxime Roberge giving two thumbs up, a small
cinnamon brown trash bin, a large bubbling royal blue-lit aquarium containing
white round rocks, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a
side table dressed with a fancy white cloth decorated with gold fleur-de-lis, a
black plastic tray of spider chow, a glossy dark violet ceramic felo chow bowl,
a soft square brown floor cushion, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a soft square dark blue rug with a luxuriously
deep pile and thick gold fringe, a small orange ball containing a realistic Bari
horde noisemaker, a hairy black and purple striped eight-legged ArachnoPal named

Howling winds whip the waves of the ocean into a frenzy. Salt spray blows across
the heavy wooden ship's timbers, thrown into the air with every crashing wave.
Canvas sails high in the air billow outwards, barely held in place by sturdy
rigging that strains to hold the ship together. Dark storm clouds boil overhead
like the wrath of a heathen god, occasionally flashing with inner lightning. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.

periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle

crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a black plastic tray of spider
chow, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing violet and blue
aquatic life and coral rocks, a small bubbling neon blue-lit toroidal aquarium

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Crew Quarters; Mid]
You see a painting framed in gold gilt of a magnificent sugar maple ablaze with
the colors of autumn, a pair of narrow bunks, a black plastic tray of spider
chow, Zorya the hovering dragonfly robot, a glossy midnight blue ceramic felo
chow bowl, a large bubbling azure blue-lit aquarium containing amber and crimson
aquatic life and round rocks, a small bubbling white-lit aquarium containing
crimson and blue aquatic life and round rocks, and a hairy yellow eight-legged

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Cryosuspension; Fore]
You see a painting framed in gold gilt of a solitary sugar maple on a snowy
hill, a row of cryosuspension tubes containing Luja Garland clawing at the
tube's hatch, her face frozen in a rictus of terror and Rogue Romano beating at
the hatch of the tube, a portable hot tub, a crudely hammered scrap metal
feeding trough, a black plastic tray of spider chow, Luja Garland's locker, and
Rogue Romano's locker here.
You can go north, south, and up.
enter cryo
You quickly undress and place your clothes in a storage locker.
You open a hatch on a row of cryosuspension tubes containing Luja Garland
clawing at the tube's hatch, her face frozen in a rictus of terror and Rogue
Romano beating at the hatch of the tube and climb in.
(60 seconds roundtime.)
You recline back in the tank. A moment later, with a hollow gurgle, you feel
viscous, ice cold liquid beginning to lap at your feet.
The liquid envelopes your feet, and they feel freezing cold for a painful moment
before going completely numb. The liquid, thick and black like crude oil, rises
slowly, turning your legs numb.
The cryo-gel rises to your abdomen and then to your chest, numbing your entire
torso. You are no longer aware of your breathing or your heartbeat. Inexorably,
the tank continues to fill.
The thick black goo laps at your chin. Instinctively, you tilt your head back,
pushing your nose and mouth into the small remaining pocket of air. Your neck
turns numb, and then the back of your head.
The liquid covers your ears and then, without any fanfare, it envelopes your
face. All you can see is blackness, and your entire body is numb. You
instinctively hold your breath.
Endless moments pass as adrenaline floods your body, though you cannot feel the
hammering of your heart. Suddenly, without even being aware of it, your body
gives up, your throat opening to desperately pull in air, but all it can find is
the thick black goo all around you. The gel floods your lungs, shockingly cold,
until the core of your body goes numb as well.
You see nothing. You feel nothing. It is impossible to judge the passing of
time.
