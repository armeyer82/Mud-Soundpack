00:58 Beacons
--------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
  BEACONS [distance | range | nearby | nearest]
Description:
  The beacons command with no arguments will allow you to see sectors, what direction the sectors are from you, how far away the sectors are, and what the coordinates of that sector are.
  Beacons distance will allow you to input two sets of galactic coordinates to get the distance between them.
  Beacons near will tell you the closest sector to your current position.
  Beacons nearest will allow you to specify a set of galactic coordinates and the ship will tell you which numbered sector is closest to those coordinates.
--------------------------------------------------

00:58 Enter the first set of galactic coordinates:

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. Tiny piles of snow seem to have built up here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.
04:43  You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

Crew NPCs
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Crew NPCs are automated characters that can perform certain operations aboard a starship. Currently they only appear in starship simulators, but this may change at a later date. To give them orders, one must use the starship's intercom, accessible with the PA-command. An attempt has been made to make commands as natural as possible as to not spawn confusion. Take heed that while this system is new, there may be bugs or oversights in NPC responses. Please REPORT these as they make themselves known to facilitate fixing them. Furthermore, this help file may be in flux as we add (or remove) compatible commands.
  Combative NPCs
Combative NPCs are non-player characters that can operate a starship's weapons. They can be given sets of coordinates and ship titles, ship numbers as indicated by the FOCUS-command, or simply told to shoot at the closest vessel.
Commands
RANGE (or GO) - Notify all crew aboard to begin firing upon the currently focused ship. This used to be the closest ship. May not actually be necessary as the crew will begin firing automatically when the ship moves within range of the focused ship.
FOCUS <ship name> - Focus all attacks on <ship>. If there is no ship present in the sector with such a name, nothing will happen.
<coordinates> - Instruct all crew aboard to fire at <coordinates>. Coordinates can be a comma-delineated list or simple numbers. (Example: 3, 3, 3.)
SHIP <number> - Instruct all crew aboard to target <ship>. The number provided should be the number that corresponds to the FOCUS menu.
STOP (or ENOUGH, STAND DOWN, KNOCK IT OFF, HOLD YOUR FIRE, SEASE FIRE) - Instruct the crew to stop focusing on the currently focused ship.
Notes
If an NPC is stationed in a weapon room containing varying types of weapons, it will traditionally pick the most effective one. For example, if there are four laser turrets and one cannon, it is likely that laser turrets would be preferred over bardenium cannons since the combined damage is greater.
   Engineering NPCs
These NPCs will act as an engineer. They will repair based on priority, abort repairs when more important damages arise, and announce warnings when critical components are damaged.
Commands
REPAIR (or REP) <component> - Your engineer will stop any ongoing repairs immediately and switch to the requested component, provided that the component isn't destroyed or undamaged. (Example: repair turret 1.)
START REPAIRING THE HULL AT <percent> (or just REPAIR THE HULL AT) - Notify your engineer that they should start repairing the hull when it reaches <percent>. Note that if desired, you can simply use a number without the percent (%) symbol. Furthermore, the NPC will begin issuing warnings via the intercom when the hull breaches this percentage. (Example: Start repairing the hull at 60%.)
WHEN AR
04:47 E YOU REPAIRING THE HULL - In case you forget when you told your NPC to commence repairs on the hull, this is the command.
WHAT ARE YOU REPAIRING - Self-explanatory. The engineer will announce over the intercom what he or she is repairing, along with an estimated timeframe until the repair's completion.
STOP REPAIRING - Instruct your engineer to stop an ongoing repair. Your engineer will not repair anything until he or she is told to repair something else. After that, they will assume they should begin working again.
Notes
Engineering NPCs will categorize components based on priority and damage. Conclusions of whether a component is important enough to repair at the time or not are often correct, but in the cases that it seems your engineer is repairing something that it shouldn't be, please report it using the REPORT-command.
  Conclusions
Crew NPCs are yet another way to sharpen one's combat prowess and learn the intricacies of commanding a starship crew. Like players themselves, they befall the same restrictions of roundtime and delays; do not expect them to be facsimiles of perfection. Enjoy commanding your crew!

Roleplay
--------
Summary
-------
Miriani is a roleplaying game. It's expected that players take on, and maintain, the role of a starship pilot at all times in public.
Details
-------
What Is Roleplay?
Simply put, roleplaying is playing the role of somebody who is not you. When you're connected to Miriani, you've shed your real life identity and stepped into the shoes of a starship pilot in the distant future. Everything you say, do, wear, eat, smell, sing, or think about should come out as if it were said, done, worn, eaten, smelled, sang or thought about by an actual starship pilot in the distant future. One aspect of roleplay in Miriani that may differ from what you're used to is that your role can be defined both by your emotes as well as your day to day actions. Since the majority of game mechanics are hardcoded, this means that actions can heavily influence roleplay. Please make sure to view the examples at the end of this policy. They help clarify a lot of the points made here.
When To Be In Character
You should remain in character at all times in public. If an area is accessible to any player, or can be viewed remotely by any player, it is considered public and you should roleplay there. If you're in a private location, such as your own starship, apartment, or house, you're allowed to be out of character so long as everybody in the room agrees. You can use the ROOC command to make it absolutely clear that you're being out of character.
Communication Channels
Communication channels follow similar rules to rooms. Generally, if a channel is accessible to any player, you should be in character at all times. Public channels include: General, Chatter, Alliance Channels 1-11, Joint Alliance, and Courier. Other channels, and their rules, are listed below.
Starship relays, long-range communication bands, and private organization channels must be kept in character at all times. These channels are intended to be used for roleplay and are very specific to that purpose.
Metafrequency channels should be first considered in character, but as long as everybody on the channel agrees, it can also be used for out of character communication. Just be certain that everybody is aware of the nature of the channel. Mixing in character and out of character conversation can be confusing. 
Private links, as the name implies, are private. They can be used for both in and out of character communication, but if a player asks you to remain in character, you must comply with that request.
Starship PAs should be considered in character unless everybody has agreed otherwise. You can check for agreement with the PA-CHECK command. 
The short-range radio should likewise be considered in character if you're in one of the primary numbered sectors. If you're in uncharted space, you may use the short-range radio for out of character communication, but it is not recommended. Like private links, you're obligated to stop being out of character if anybody requests that you remain in character.
Communicator Filters
Emoticons and certain abbreviations are considered to be out of character. Since these are very commonly used on the internet, we've employed filters that will automatically replace most of these instances with their appropriate English counterparts. You should avoid using emoticons and abbreviations wherever possible. Similarly, you should not intentionally work around filters to get emoticons or abbreviations to show when they're not intended to. This is considered a workaround (see the policy on bug abuse / cheating / workarounds) and can result in having your communication rights temporarily revoked.
Exceptions
There are only two situations that override the rules on where and when you can be in character in rooms and on communicators: The first is if a host speaks on a channel and asks for input or a response. In this very rare case, you're free to be out of character until the host says otherwise. The second exception is host-run roleplay events. You'll typically know an event is happening because you'll see a new character who doesn't show up on the @who list engaging players in activities not ordinarily available to them. When an event is taking place, you must be in character at all times, regardless of location.
Rerolls
A reroll is somebody who has deleted their old character and created a new one. When a person rerolls, they are an entirely new character. As such, you should not treat these people the same as you did their last character unless their actions justify it. Past grudges should be deleted along with the past character. Taking action against somebody because of who you think, or even know, they used to be is a direct violation of this policy. Similarly, continually asking somebody who they used to be is against this policy and could be considered harassment if you persist. Likewise, you should absolutely never seek somebody outside the game solely to learn who they used to be.
Theme
Miriani's theme is life in the future, with a particular emphasis on space flight and the consequences thereof. Out of theme roleplay is defined as playing your character in a manner not within the theme or scope of the game. It is also considered out of theme to assign actions to any people who did not give express permission to do so. This includes past as well as current characters. If you're unable to get permission from a player, you should not presume to change their story by including them in your roleplay. The examples section of this policy lists a number of appropriate, and inappropriate, roleplay. Please peruse it.
Emote Abuse
Emote abuse is the use of the emote or ROOMPOSE commands to trick other players into believing that something has happened when it really hasn't. Typically, this takes the form of a player spoofing output typically generated by the game to mislead others. Your emotes should be limited to actions being taken by your character.
Explicit Roleplay, Age-Appropriateness, and Liability
Since Miriani allows players under the age of 18, we must be careful about what content they're exposed to and what activities they engage in. For this reason, this policy strictly forbids any minors (individuals under the age of 18) from engaging in roleplay or out of character actions of a sexual nature. Under no circumstances should a minor seek out sexual encounters, offer sexual encounters to others, negotiate contact information with others for the purposes of engaging in sexual activities outside of the game, or engage in sexual discussions of any kind.
This policy of zero tolerance is in place for the safety of EVERYBODY. As such, any minors found to be engaging in sexual activities will be immediately and permanently banned from the game. Similarly, any adults knowingly participating in sexual activities with minors will also be permanently banned from the game.
Enforcement
-----------
Being out of character in a public area, on public channels, or when asked to remain IC by another player will result in an OOC warning. After you have received three OOC warnings, automatic point losses will take place and you will receive small amounts of stun time. Point losses and stun time will 
05:07 scale based on how many OOC warnings you have. 
Participating in out of theme roleplay will net you the following penalties, in order of severity:
1: A host will explain why your roleplay is inappropriate and warn you that continuing will result in penalties. 
2: You will lose 100 license points.
3: You will lose 10% of your current license points.
4: You will be given the choice of either a three week lockout or having your current character deleted.
5: You will be permanently banned.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin.

Crew NPCs
--------------------------------------------------
  Introduction
Crew NPCs are automated characters that can perform certain operations aboard a starship. Currently they only appear in starship simulators, but this may change at a later date. To give them orders, one must use the starship's intercom, accessible with the PA-command. An attempt has been made to make commands as natural as possible as to not spawn confusion. Take heed that while this system is new, there may be bugs or oversights in NPC responses. Please REPORT these as they make themselves known to facilitate fixing them. Furthermore, this help file may be in flux as we add (or remove) compatible commands.
  Combative NPCs
Combative NPCs are non-player characters that can operate a starship's weapons. They can be given sets of coordinates and ship titles, ship numbers as indicated by the FOCUS-command, or simply told to shoot at the closest vessel.
Commands
RANGE (or GO) - Notify all crew aboard to begin firing upon the currently focused ship. This used to be the closest ship. May not actually be necessary as the crew will begin firing automatically when the ship moves within range of the focused ship.
FOCUS <ship name> - Focus all attacks on <ship>. If there is no ship present in the sector with such a name, nothing will happen.
<coordinates> - Instruct all crew aboard to fire at <coordinates>. Coordinates can be a comma-delineated list or simple numbers. (Example: 3, 3, 3.)
SHIP <number> - Instruct all crew aboard to target <ship>. The number provided should be the number that corresponds to the FOCUS menu.
STOP (or ENOUGH, STAND DOWN, KNOCK IT OFF, HOLD YOUR FIRE, SEASE FIRE) - Instruct the crew to stop focusing on the currently focused ship.
Notes
If an NPC is stationed in a weapon room containing varying types of weapons, it will traditionally pick the most effective one. For example, if there are four laser turrets and one cannon, it is likely that laser turrets would be preferred over bardenium cannons since the combined damage is greater.
   Engineering NPCs
These NPCs will act as an engineer. They will repair based on priority, abort repairs when more important damages arise, and announce warnings when critical components are damaged.
Commands
REPAIR (or REP) <component> - Your engineer will stop any ongoing repairs immediately and switch to the requested component, provided that the component isn't destroyed or undamaged. (Example: repair turret 1.)
START REPAIRING THE HULL AT <percent> (or just REPAIR THE HULL AT) - Notify your engineer that they should start repairing the hull when it reaches <percent>. Note that if desired, you can simply use a number without the percent (%) symbol. Furthermore, the NPC will begin issuing warnings via the intercom when the hull breaches this percentage. (Example: Start repairing the hull at 60%.)
WHEN AR
13:22 E YOU REPAIRING THE HULL - In case you forget when you told your NPC to commence repairs on the hull, this is the command.
WHAT ARE YOU REPAIRING - Self-explanatory. The engineer will announce over the intercom what he or she is repairing, along with an estimated timeframe until the repair's completion.
STOP REPAIRING - Instruct your engineer to stop an ongoing repair. Your engineer will not repair anything until he or she is told to repair something else. After that, they will assume they should begin working again.
Notes
Engineering NPCs will categorize components based on priority and damage. Conclusions of whether a component is important enough to repair at the time or not are often correct, but in the cases that it seems your engineer is repairing something that it shouldn't be, please report it using the REPORT-command.
  Conclusions
Crew NPCs are yet another way to sharpen one's combat prowess and learn the intricacies of commanding a starship crew. Like players themselves, they befall the same restrictions of roundtime and delays; do not expect them to be facsimiles of perfection. Enjoy commanding your crew!

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. Light pours into the room from the star outside the window. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent
22:18  red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white tras
23:31 h bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, and a purple velvet artifact storage container here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (dozing) (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

23:51 Kissy the droid

23:51 This machine is humanoid in shape, but completely mechanical in construction. Its silver outer shell is constructed from a light, sturdy metal that is soft to the touch yet extremely durable to abuse. A small barrel extends beneath the droid's hand at the wrist. The droid's back is slightly hunched where a storage area exists, allowing for the storage and transportation of a fair amount of cargo. The smooth metal along the front of the droid is interrupted only for a small panel in its chest. A small sticker beneath the panel reads: "Warning: Ammunition storage. Lukco Robotics is not responsible for the mishandling of ammunition." The droid's face is bare and lifeless. The mouth, seemingly as a cost saving measure, is a small red LED beside a speaker, the two of which lie behind a translucent textured panel. There is no nose and only a vague indication of a facial structure. Two camera lenses behind transparent covers give the droid a lifeless, slightly sinister look. She is covered in a hardened translucent blue film.
She is powered up and looks alert.
She is wearing a lovely pink cotton butterfly-print sundress.  She is wearing a pair of glittery pink stiletto heels on her feet. She is also wearing a planet Mars keyring.
She is carrying nothing.
