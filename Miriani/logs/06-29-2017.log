00:30 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

00:35 You peer out and see...

00:35 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

00:35 [Private | Calyssa Calaway] You transmit, "Wow! getting people for missions is like pulling teeth!"

00:35 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Pax (Commonwealth Docking Station) to Miriani flight control, an automated laser turret has fired on an AIE starship."

00:35 [Private | Calyssa Calaway] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "it is"

00:36 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "One spot."

00:36 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

00:36 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

00:36 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:36 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

00:36 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Its even eng."

00:36 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

00:36 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

00:36 You're already sitting down.

00:36 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

00:36 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your chair.

00:37 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

00:37 The computer announces, "Two planets have been detected in the sector."

00:37 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

00:37 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 4, 10, 8."

00:37 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:37 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

00:37 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

00:37 The five-person transverser "Frost Fire" has jumped into the sector.

00:37 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

00:37 Multiple landing sites detected. Where do you wish to land?

[General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Really? No one wants eng?"

00:37 The five-person transverser "Frost Fire" has initiated an intrasector wavewarp.

00:37 The computer reports the five-person transverser "Frost Fire" is one unit away from this ship.

00:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

00:37 Invalid selection.

00:37 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

00:37 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the garage.

00:38 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Ok one more for gunship diffs."

00:39 [General Communication] Calyssa Calaway transmits, "Ok guys you all good with frikkit mods then?"

00:50 [Short-range Communication] Aaron Blade transmits, "Rude."

00:50 You peer west and see...

00:50 ["Chain of Memories" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see an internal stun turret, a thick covering of white sand covering the ground, a dark blue plastic cooler on wheels, a sapphire blue crystal dolphin-shaped Hostian sea scented air freshener plugged in to the wall, a large soft ocean blue and white seashell shaped area rug placed in the center of the room, and an enormous dark purple cloth beach blanket here.
You can go east and west.

00:51 You press a small button mounted on the wall and chuckle.

00:51 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

00:51 Aaron Blade's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "maybe you can use some of that to buy wr 1 a chair?"

00:51 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

You press a small button mounted on the wall and chuckle.

00:51 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

00:51 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The four-person roborant "Chain of Memories" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

00:51 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

00:51 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

00:51 Calyssa Calaway's voice comes over the intercom, saying, "there used to be one in there"

00:51 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

00:51 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

00:51 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

00:51 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

00:51 You press a small button mounted on the wall and say, "Cally probably ate it."

00:51 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

01:10 Calyssa Calaway cheers over the intercom.

01:10 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

01:10 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person frigate "Magical Sonata" has launched from Rolukssica.

01:10 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:10 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:11 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:11 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:11 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:11 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:11 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person frigate "Magical Sonata" has initiated an intrasector slip.

01:11 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

01:11 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:11 The lights overhead suddenly flicker as they change from green to yellow.

01:11 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person frigate "Magical Sonata" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

01:11 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:11 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:11 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:11 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:11 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

01:11 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles. A large diagram of the starship is displayed on a monitor on the wall, constantly updating with reports of damage. Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a fluffy green carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. Looking through the frosted window, you see the ship is in space.

Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a sapphire blue light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a polished hardwood floor. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert status. There is an independent damage monitoring terminal here. Looking through the frosted window, you see the ship is in space.

01:46 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

01:46 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person frigate "Magical Sonata" has launched from Rolukssica.

01:46 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

01:46 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

01:47 The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

01:47 You hear a sharp whine as the starship begins an intrasector slip.

01:47 The starship shudders beneath your feet. It feels like the hull is breaking apart around you.

01:47 With a sharp lurch, the starship completes its intrasector slip.

01:47 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person frigate "Magical Sonata" has initiated an intrasector slip.

01:47 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot disengaged."

01:47 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Autopilot engaged."

01:47 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Mission security clearance code has been accepted. Entering jumpgate to enemy space."

01:47 You feel a mild vibration as the ship nears the active jumpgate.

01:47 (Alliance High Guard Command; Observation Lounge) The five-person frigate "Magical Sonata" has entered Mission Jumpgate.

01:47 You feel the sudden pull of acceleration as the starship's relativity drive kicks in, hurling you through the gate's event horizon.

01:47 The windows automatically dim as gate after gate becomes visible, each causing a brilliant flash of light as it redirects the wormhole.

01:47 You are suddenly jarred as the ship begins rapid deceleration.

01:47 The experience abruptly ends as the starship exits from the companion jumpgate and the relativity drive takes over to slow the ship to a stop.

01:47 The computer announces, "Control room reports: Eight starships have been detected in the sector."

01:48 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

12:39 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.

13:44 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

13:49 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Muzano the droid, Ralf the droid, Rika the droid, Aria the droid, a glossy red security drone, a glossy green security drone, a slim violet security drone, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Puff the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Blossom the droid, Chiccon

13:49 For a top, you are wearing a celestial blue cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of blue sneakers with gold laces over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a black stun armor storage bag, and a high-capacity transparent Lore computer.

22:05 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a cherry wood coffee table, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, and a metallic red starship simulator here.
You can go south and out.
