["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Planet 47919.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security drones, an internal
13:20  stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, Mekensie the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a printout of the service record for "Starlight Express" here.
You see Katrianne Beauchene (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end) here, sleeping.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Planet 47919.

End of announcements.

16:08 Last ten announcements:
[01/05/18 - 10:00 a.m.] Announcement: Good morning, friends! Inconvenient news! We're going to need a bit of downtime to do some things and stuff. So ten minutes from now (10:10 AM CST on 1-5-18) the server will be shutdown. It should be back 10-30 minutes later, depending on how badly things go. If it's an hour or more, you know all hope is lost and panic is all we have left. Sorry for the inconvenience!
[01/18/18 - 7:54 p.m.] Announcement: The tattoo parlor on Surgyria is temporarily closed down due to a health department mandate. Hopefully, it will be reopening very shortly. We apologize for the inconvenience.
[03/13/18 - 11:30 p.m.] Announcement: It is with heavy hearts today that we would like to acknowledge the death of a scientific legend. The physicist Stephen Hawking has passed away today at age 76. Defying all expectations, he was one of the greatest intellectuals that tirelessly researched and discovered mysteries about the universe we live in today. We've lost an inspirational and brilliant mind. R.I.P. 1942-2018
[03/14/18 - 9:09 p.m.] Announcement: Ahem. If anyone you know has tried to create an account between March 9, 2018 and now, they should once again be able to create one without getting violently disconnected. Sorry about that!
[04/01/18 - 12:08 a.m.] Announcement: Happy Easter, and april Fools!
[04/01/18 - 12:13 a.m.] Announcement: The annual Easter egg hunt has commenced! You can retrieve an Easter
16:08  basket on Jump Hub Station. Fill it with eggs and, once Easter is over, the person who has collected the most eggs will win a fabulous prize. You can see the current rankings by typing @TOP-EGGS. Good luck!
[04/01/18 - 11:01 p.m.] Announcement: Easter / april Fools will be ending in roughly one hour. Get those eggs while they're hot!
[04/02/18 - 8:52 p.m.] Announcement: Easter eggs can now be opened. Credit rewards have been halved, and you will also find other things other than credits as well. Enjoy!
[04/24/18 - 7:07 p.m.] Announcement: There seems to be an excess  of blatantly out of character communication peppering the airwaves tonight. We encourage any new players to re-read POLICY 3: Roleplay. For the next 12 hours, rather than handing out OOC warnings, we will be disabling your ability to communicate on public IC channels to cut down on the severe amount of OOCness and immersion shattering goodness. Please be considerate of other players!

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator
16:11 , three translucent red security drones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, Mekensie the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a printout of the service record for "Starlight Express" here.
You can go northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

16:12 You are already number 3 in the queue. Your request is: "We just flew into this sector and I obtained a planetary scan from the ship as well as used the handheld planetary surveyor, but I don't appear to have received credit for it. When I "info", I still only see 13 planets surveyed. Neither Katrianne nor me seem to have received credit."

Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

19:11 Emissive Energy Scanning Enhancement
--------------------------------------------------
The emissive energy scanning enhancement upgrade allows your ship to detect emissive energy signatures as part of the long-range scanning routine. This means that if a starship is powered up on, say, an asteroid in uncharted space and that asteroid is within range of your long-range sensors, your ship will report the asteroid and the presence of energy signatures on the surface.

["Starlight Express" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush gray carpet. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space. There is a small puddle of water on the ground here.
You see a dark blue suede captain's chair and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair situated directly in front of the starmap viewer. In the back of the room, arranged as a small seating area are a tall oak wood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end, a rectangular-shaped black glass coffee table, a black rosewood side table, a black rosewood end table, and a white trash bin. You also see a shiny silver starship simulator, three translucent red security d
23:54 rones, an internal stun turret, a slim blue medical drone, a gleaming red security drone, a stack of neatly split logs, an enormous granite fireplace with a marble hearth and a mahogany mantel, a red furniture trolley, Kitcat the droid, Kissy the droid, Jenaia the droid, a large flower pot of pink and lavender Easter lilies, an all-occasions party robotic chef, Mekensie the droid, a purple velvet artifact storage container, and a printout of the service record for "Starlight Express" here.
