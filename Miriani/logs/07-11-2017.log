Attention alliance pilots,
As you know, hopefully, we are attempting to work with High Guard on a coordinated effort against the increased threat presented by the praelor since their development of the Kritzn ship, which disrupts our FTL technology.
So far, we have learned that the Kritzn are produced in a single facility, but the location of that facility is still under investigation.
High Guard has requested a force of alliance pilots to assist in this matter, by participating in, essentially, a massive combat mission, where in we will take our available warships, crew up and do battle in praelor space, in order to provide High Guard scouts to locate the Kritzn production facility. we may also have the opportunity to wipe out a number of already constructed Kritzn, meaning that many fewer who can make it to alliance space and disrupt our lives.
If you are interested in participating in this important mission, please contact your alliance representative and let them know.
AIE Reps:
aria Hunter
Ryan salvatore
Commonwealth Reps:
Andreas Fierro
Moiraine soto
Hale reps:
Amy Draksen
Michael calaway
Please also address questions and concerns to these in
02:35 dividuals.
Hope to see you all in battle!

She is a member of the Commonwealth alliance.
She is awake, but appears to be staring off into space.
This 24 year old woman stands 5 feet and 10 inches tall and is lithe with a large bust size. She has a dark complexion. She is wearing a red rose in her waist-length, midnight black hair, which is swept up with a mass of curls spilling about the shoulders. She has expressive jade green eyes with a snub nose above brilliantly white, straight teeth.  She appears to have adopted an aggressive stance. She is surrounded by a faint azure glow.
She has a tattoo of a sapphire blue flaming dragon on her right shoulder.
She has a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her left earlobe and a feminine silver oval sterling silver drop earring flecked with tiny diamonds in her right earlobe. Her eyes are accented with smoky silver eyeshadow. She is wearing light red lip gloss on her lips. The nails on her left hand are painted rose and adorned with slivers of black onyx and the nails on her right hand are painted rose and adorned with slivers of black onyx.
She is not wearing a top. She is not wearing a bottom. She is wearing a black leather belt with a rose shaped buckle around her waist. She is also wearing a two-tone gold diamond-studded eternity ring, a round gold-trimmed locket on a silver chain, a rose gold signet ring carved with the word "Commonwealth" surrounding a beaming sun, an eme
03:25 rald-studded sterling silver digital pocketwatch with a square crystal display, a simple white gold chain with a glowing crystal sphere encrusted with numerous precious gems dangling from it, a black leather purse with an ornate silver rose-shaped clasp, a black leather briefcase, a sparkly black suede diaper bag patterned with lions, a softly padded black snuggly, a light orange padded satin all-purpose sling, a compact silver Lore computer, two black metafrequency communication pins, a black metafrequency earpiece, a black metafrequency communicator, a wrist mounted astro-blaster, an ammunition storage container, a white fuzzy artifact storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a gray rolled toolkit, a black armor storage bag, an archaeological artifact storage container, a level one archaeological dig site scanner, a black spacesuit navigational computer, a black spacesuit jet, and a platinum Commoveo membership ring.
She is carrying nothing.

14:56 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

15:09 
Kitty,
That was a hell of a surprise finding you in my ship. I thought you had made it clear that I needed to prove to you that I still wanted you and therefore, you were going to give me time and space. However, that is apparently not the case.
Look. I appreciate the time we have spent together and everything you have shown me. I'm sorry if you feel hurt and I definitely understand, but if you wanted me back, this is not the way to go about it.
First of all, I do not appreciate the comments over my private comm regarding where you tracked me. It is certainly not a whore house and I resent the fact that you would call it that based on a name. Obviously, you're still too upset and sad to think straight. Jumping to conclusions and presumptions is certainly no way to win my heart back.
Since the day I broke up with you, I have since found someone new. I had considered giving us a second chance, but based on the hostility directed at me from you, I don't think it's going to work out for you and me at this time. Perhaps later in the future.
Tibo

Two entire walls of this busy mailroom are lined top to bottom with gleaming metal mailboxes with glass fronts. Biometric thumbprint locks glow faintly green on each of them. Set in the middle of the turquoise tiled floor is a battered wooden table where an elderly man sits behind several stacks of letters. A column of slots in the back wall facilitates the sending of mail, and across from it is a narrow screen for ordering letters or packaging. Through a glass door in the back wall between the mail slots and the menu terminal, a team of droids is visible rushing back and forth carrying boxes or armloads of letters. A small music player on the corner of the table in the middle of the room is playing a talk show at a low volume.

15:17 ["Hellion" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.

15:49 ["Hellion" Control Room] (sitting on a comfy rich blue leather sectional sofa with a soft pillow at each end)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Lover's Paradise; Hangar.

Roleplay Commands
--------------------------------------------------
Miriani has a number of commands available to assist you in the creation of dynamic roleplay environments and situations. These commands allow you to customize how you look, how you walk, how you act, and even arrange the items in rooms that you own. This help file will give you a brief rundown of all of these commands as well as pointers to the help files that explain the command usage in much greater detail.

  Emote
The emote command is among the most powerful and dynamic for customizing the way your character acts and reacts. It also serves as the basis for the syntax of a number of the other commands below, so it's worth learning what emote can do. Miriani uses a system known as E2 (emote 2.0) that allows you to reference people and objects in your emotes, do pronoun substitutions, randomize lists of possible actions, and even override the output of several standard commands in the game. 

To see a full list of capabilities, as well as the syntax for accomplishing them, see HELP EXTENDED EMOTES

  Room Poses
Room poses allow you to add information about what you're currently doing in a room. It will appear after your name in the room's description. For example, you may want people to see that you're leaning nonchalantly against a wall. When you set your room pose, anybody LOOKing at the room will see: 'You see Albori leaning nonchalantly against the wall here.'  Room poses aren't limited to just your character, though. You can also set room poses on objects as well.

For an exhaustive explanation of this feature, see HELP ROOM POSES

  Grouped Room Poses
Grouped room poses allow you to create a single room pose and group several objects around it. Say, for example, that you wanted some gadgets to be sitting on top of your spacesuit. You could, certainly, apply an individual room pose to each object. However, that would look cluttered and redundant: "You see a communicator sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, a destination finder sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit, etc here." There is a better way!

With grouped room poses, you can create a single pose (in our example, "sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit") and then add the objects to the pose. Then you end up with: "You see a communicator, a destination finder, a message board reader, and a flight control scanner sitting atop a neatly folded spacesuit here.")

For more on how to use grouped room poses, see HELP GROUPED ROOM POSES

  Sit Poses
Sit poses allow you to customize the way you're sitting on an object. You may, for instance, want to lean back in a recliner. The syntax for that would be: SIT RECLINER AS "leaning back with the footstool up"

This would appear to the room as: Albori Sninvel (leaning back with the footstool up on a well-worn blue recliner).

  Sort
If you're very particular about the order in which objects appear, you can use the SORT command. This works in rooms you own, containers, and even what you're wearing.

For specific instructions, see HELP SORT

  Microdetails
Microdetails are temporary lines of text that you can add to the end of your description for a preset amount of time, ranging anywhere from an hour to a week. To set your microdetails, type MICRODETAILS (or MICRO). This command is not meant to replace coded systems like clothing, makeup, or custom hair styles. Rather, it's meant to enhance those systems or to add little details about your character's current situation that you otherwise would not be able to have. You can quickly view other player's microdetail additions by typing MICROS [person] or EXTRA [person].

  Walk Styles
Walk styles allow you to customize the way your character moves from room to room. There are quite a few to choose from, which you can access via the WALK command.

Additionally, if you don't want to commit to any single style all the time, you can use temporary walk styles. Each style is also a command that you can type instead of the word GO. For example, say you want to stalk angerly into your ship. Instead of typing WALK, choosing stalk, entering your ship, and typing WALK again, you can simply type: STALK <ship name>. 

  Custom Socials
Custom socials allow you to cement an EMOTE into its own special command. This makes it li
19:01 ke any of socials you might find in @SOCIALS (and, in fact, your custom socials will be listed in that command after you create them). 

For more information on creating custom socials, see HELP @CUSTOM-SOCIALS.

In addition, you can also create special socials that can be used over the communicator. Creating these types of socials is available from the @CUSTOM-SOCIALS menu.

For more information on how to use communicator socials, see the 'Emoting' section of HELP COMMUNICATORS.

  Emoting On Unidle
If you want to trigger an emote after you unidle, the WAKEUP-OPTIONS command is the place to set that. This is useful for people who may want to, for instance, suddenly jerk awake but are too lazy to type it themselves every time.

23:14 [Newbie] Melanie Sanchez: Is there a way to get everything out of a salvage container without pulling everything out piece by piece? For example if you wanted to just empty the container without putting everything in a bag, could you do it?

23:15 [Newbie] Emily McManomy: No.

23:15 [Newbie] Emily McManomy: Dump thing in bag or getting them.

23:15 [Newbie] Daniel Karero: You can get stuff out of a salvage container. Just get [item] from salvage.

23:16 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Dumping things in bags won't work for everything, such as furniture.

23:16 [Newbie] Melanie Sanchez: Yes I understand this. But some of the stuff in my salvage container belonged to past characters and for some reason a few of these items won't let me pull them out.

23:16 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Are they traesman?

23:16 [Newbie] Melanie Sanchez: Yes.

23:17 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Are the character's still around?

23:17 [Newbie] Melanie Sanchez: No. I rerolled.

23:17 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Have you got them out of the container manually?

23:17 [Newbie] Beatrice Carmichael: Then those items should still be owned by you. Assist if you can't get them out.

23:17 [Newbie] Melanie Sanchez: I am not able to do that as I've already said.

23:17 [Newbie] Cara West: Then the stuff in the salvage container is yours. If you can't get the stuff then probably should assist.

23:29 [Newbie] Melanie Sanchez: Hi again guys, one more question I think. I know once upon a time pilots in cargo haulers couldn't jump to places like Desolo, but then I think that maybe changed. Am I right or is it still the case that you can't get to 37 in a cargo hauler?

23:30 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: The jumpgate network will take you there.

23:30 [Newbie] Cara West: You can. There's jumpgates to all 40 sectors in 0.

23:30 [Newbie] Melanie Sanchez: Awesome, that's what I thought I'd remembered but it's been ages.

23:30 [Newbie] Daniel Karero: If you are talking about the FTL drive, you can't. Cargo haulers only have like 5 light years I think.

23:30 [Newbie] Melanie Sanchez: No no I was thinking the jump gate network.
