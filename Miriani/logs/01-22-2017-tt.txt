Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the
collar and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria', and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Subject: Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!

Ever want to be a tea drinking champion on holovids everywhere? Well, here's
your chance. Show the pilot core how well you can drink tea while navigating
your starship in the first possibly anual rift race!
that's right, you heard correctly. Allied Libertarians is sponsoring a rift race
for interested pilots. What's required? I'm glad you asked.
All you need is your very own Gemini complete with rift upgrades. If you don't
have a rift capable gem, you may crew with one other person. No overfilling.
What are the rules?
Essentially, the first ship and crew to complete the course wins the prize. If
we get a lot of entries, there will be consolation prizes.
You must use a gemini to give everyone as equal a playing field as possible,
although you can put whatever upgrades you can on that gemini.
The course will be one circuit of an estimated twenty to twenty-five lightyears,
or roughly three ltc. You will not know the course in advance, each waypoint
along the way will provide you with the next general direction you need to head.
In addition, you must stop at the waypoint and pick up a plaque proving you were
there.
Any additions to the rules or changes will be posted no later than 23:59 on
February first.
Prizes are first place 500000000 Eaos credits. If we have enough people to
warrant it, second is 250000000 Eaos credits, and third is 50000000 Eaos
credits.
Thanks,
the allied Libertarians Team

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle

and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.

bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
