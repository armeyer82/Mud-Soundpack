Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large

windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the

[Starship "Davion James"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

[Starship "Davion James"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "Raptor"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, an interdictor launcher, and a black leather
captain's chair here.
Melinda Michaels is standing here.
You can go south, up, and out.

You hear the whirring of reflectors orienting themselves on the hull as they
move to deflect incoming laser fire.
A number of coherent beams of weaponized light flash by the window as the
starship shudders under laser fire. The impact seems slightly lessened by the
ship's ablative armor.
The computer announces, "This ship has been hit by Allied Pirates starship 'It's
Too Bad She Won't Live.'"

A beacon has been placed trailing the orbit of Candelaria, a waypoint on the way
to and from deeper space.
This beacon lies along the path of the local solar system's galactic orbit. Dust
and debris has been pulled in its wake, leaving a funnel-shaped void.
Suddenly your ship is in the midst of a cloud of debris. Clearly these are the
remnants of a great battle, having long since drifted away from where it
originally took place.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-105 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Celestial Explorer.' Welcome to The Second Battle of Deep

Star Conquest Help: Space Geography

Category: Game Systems

Star Conquest has a fully-realized space system as one of its primary features.
Space is big and it can be confusing. Sometimes intentionally! But here are the
basics.
SECTORS
Space is divided into sectors, which are simply a way of marking off and
differentiating volumes of space.
Sectors are three-dimensional, and are further subdivided into coordinates: 20
by 20 by 20.
Numbers! Each sector is 240,000km across on each axis, or about 1/625th of an
astronomical unit, or about 8/10ths of a light-second. So, a lightyear is just
shy of 40 million sectors. This would be common knowledge among pilots.
BEACONS
A sector exists because a beacon has been placed there broadcasting its
location. This beacon is what allows starships to jump there using their
wormhole drive.
Beacons can be based on planets, on space stations, or free-floating in a beacon
housing.
There are three types of beacons you'll commonly encounter:
* Primary beacons: These are beacons for main sectors that you can jump to from
any location (with a few exceptions). Examples are Earthgate, Providence Gate,
or the Dusty Reaches. These are primary thoroughfares and also act as travel
bottlenecks.
* Secondary beacons: These are used within a sector cluster. For instance, Old
Earth Orbit and Martian Orbit are both marked by secondary beacons. What this
means is that from another sector cluster, you would first have to jump to
Earthgate, because that is the primary beacon for the cluster. From there, you
can jump to Old Earth or Mars, the secondary beacons.
* Weak beacons: These are not really a separate category, because primary or
secondary beacons can also be weak. Weak beacons do not broadcast over a wide
range, and generally a ship's computer must know of its approximate location
before it can scan for a weak beacon. Scanning will still usually take several
attempts. Weak beacons are used in Mutuality space to help it remain hidden.
SECURITY
Sectors also each have a security rating describing the degree of safety you can
expect there. Check the SECURITY RATINGS help file for more information.
MOVING BETWEEN SECTORS
You can travel to other sectors with your starship's JUMP command. You can type
this command by itself for a list of accessible sectors, or you can type JUMP
[sector name] to start traveling there immediately. For instance, JUMP EARTHGATE
will take you straight to the Earthgate sector from most locations.
Your starship can also successfully navigate multiple jumps. For instance, if
you're in a distant sector cluster and you type JUMP OLD EARTH, your ship will
automatically travel first to Earthgate and then make a second jump to Old Earth
Orbit. Linked jumps such as these will occur faster and use less battery charge
than if you performed the jumps individually.

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending
machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The four-person light carrier "Meteor Shower" and the two-person Accord gemini
"Hexidus" are landed here.

You nod to Robert O'Malley.
Joel Kringle sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.
Evenia spreads her hands. "Either way. I just don't want him waking up and
having issues getting it."
Damien Alexander says in a Tenosque accent, "Forget how much space a mule takes
up."
[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Is it possible to keep the

[Tactical Communication] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Could we alternate bolts?"
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "I have access to a light
carrier."
Damien Alexander says in a Tenosque accent, "Can ya dock somebody else's ship

face.
-eve Well, pick who. Damien and I are willing to go
You say to Evenia, "Well, pick who. Damien and I are willing to go."
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "That was over a hypercast. All of those
come through as unidentified when you first see them, unless the person flying
the ship identifies themselves. You can't disguise your voice over comms."
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Well, I have a key, so docking
won't be an issue if that's what you guys wanna do."
Morris Corlew asks in an Old Earth accent, "Couldn't he just take the Hexidus
out to accord, dock it on his mule, and then go about his business?"
Morris Corlew says in an Old Earth accent, "Oh wait...probably no room."
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We only really have two
available bolts, and while I won't speak for Anfisa, my schedule of availability
has been pretty unpredictable as of late. I also don't want to make the mistakes
that Gray made and just hand keys out."
Damien Alexander asks in a Tenosque accent, "What's Hexidus? Fighter?"
'Gem won't fit in a Mule
You say, "Gem won't fit in a Mule."
Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "No, gem is too big."

Damien Alexander nods.
Morris says to Damien, "'it's a gem."
Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "Well, since I've not flown with
you yet shule, damien, you wanna help?"
[General Communication] Cesar Ysidro transmits, "Clearly we need Alphonse to
help."
Damien says to Evenia, "Sure."
Morris Corlew asks in an Old Earth accent, "Anything I can do?"
[Newbie Help] Harvey Fredricks transmits, "So technically anyone can go park
their ship, screw with people on the hypercast at Torus or whatever and unless
they say, Hi it's Bob, you don't know who it is? If that's so, I still don't
understand why everyone is like FIND THAT PERSON."
Joel Kringle takes a sip from a large mug in the shape of Franklin the Elf's
face.
Robert O'Malley speaks into his red metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Robert O'Malley transmits, "Alphonse? Who's that?"
[Newbie Help] Harvey Fredricks transmits, "What am I missing?"
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "There's a special kind of hypercast
relay system at The Torus which relays any hypercast it gets through a comm
channel. We can use the same channel to send hypercasts out via the Torus
hypercaster. But hypercasts come from ships, so if you see a ship that hasn't
sent an identification ping, that's what it will look like, so that's what The
Torus relays through the comms."
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Yeah, get me more alcohol while
I'm gone."
Evenia Callseah laughs.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "To the owner of the gemini
Hexidus, please power your ship down and do your part to minimize potential bari
infestations!"
laugh
You laugh.
[Newbie Help] A synthesized voice identified as Anfisa of Marzore transmits,
"Hyperwaves are from ships to transmit over long distances. If the ship sends an
indentification ping, they're identified for an hour or so, otherwise they show
up as an unidentified vessel of some sort."
Morris Corlew grins at Evenia Callseah.

[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It very likely could've been a prank.
We've done hypercasting pranks before. That's the fun of it. You never know!"
I'd say put in a carrier
I don't understand that.
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Well, most of us don't..."
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Carrier is probably easier, if we
can fit it in."

You say, "I'd say in a carriier."
'er, carrier
You say, "Er, carrier."
Joel Kringle takes a sip from a large mug in the shape of Franklin the Elf's
face.
"You got a ship here, or you wanna ride with me ta Chet ta get my carrier?"
Damien Alexander nods.

be unleashed on you."
A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person
heavy launch vessel "Registered Merchant 651".
Robert O'Malley laughs.

the hatch is cracked?"
Joel Kringle says in a southern California accent, "You would."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anybody got a key to
Nathaniel's gem?"
[Newbie Help] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "The beauty of unidentified
hypercasts is that you never know if it's a prank or if it's real!"
Evenia Callseah says in an Ars Magnan accent, "Okay. Robert, I'll catch up with
ya later for the egg thing."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I suppose it's irrelevant.
Hopefully the spaceport will power it down in a bit."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just have to hope no one does
anything bari-relatedly stupid for the enxt couple hours."
Evenia Callseah stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.
Robert says to Evenia, "You better."
Morris Corlew speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hope so. Poke him in the ribs

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[Starship "Davion James"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

I would like to suggest that an option be created that allows you to suppress
the tips that you get when logging in. The tips are really geared more towards
newer players, and those who have been around a while, or even a new player
who's a reroll and knows all of them already, might want to turn them off.
Thoughts?

They don't really bother me. Maybe some new tips in the ticker would be neat
though, like "TIP: Forgot what AUTH code you set on your ship? You can get it
reset if you CLAIM the ship with your ship title at most starship sales
outlets!" or "TIP: You can DELETE keys to ships you own at some stores."

The hosts have mentioned this before.  those were originally added before many
of the changes were made to the game.  I'll be writing quite a few geared more
towards long term game play and some of the newer features.

Subject: missions completed percent?
Author: lunarfang
Posted: Thu Jun 23 21:15:43 2016 UTC

I've noticed, that when I've done the accord salvage missions, the past few,
even though I've turned in the required cargo, it doesn't complete. I asked
about this, and was told that it's because I took stuff from someone elses
mission. so my questions and ideas are a few. how can you tell if the debris
chunk you're grappeling is for your mission or not. because right now there's no
way to tell. second, if you do grapple the wrong chunks, and transfer, can there
be a note under the mission that says you need x ammount more, or you've
transfered this ammount? it would make things a little easier. since I get small
ifs wrecks, grade 30 to 50, there's no way to know that the wreck I'm grappeling
isn't mine, unless it's like grade 60 and there's stuff pulled off of it
already, something that hasn't happened to me.

I don't have the exact answer that you are likely looking for. However, don't go
after the chunks in the main sector. Travel farther out to where you are likely
not going to stumble upon someone else's mission debris chunks. Obviously too,
once you have transferred the correct amount of debris, you will receive a
message stating that you have completed a mission.

Subject: Roundtime during grappling chunks.
Author: Cerelum
Posted: Fri Jun 24 01:39:47 2016 UTC

I understand that it's so you can't go grapple # # # grapple # # # in as fast as
you can type.
However, I feel that having the actual round time screws you up more than
anything because you can't talk, you can't broadcast, you can't do anything
while grappling a chunk.
It would make more sense if during the "roundtime" of adjusting the angle, you
could transmit, talk or whatever.  Similar to how if you type salvage, you can
immediately transmit or talk.
Seems silly that the two are different and I think it's just a programming
oversight.
Thoughts?

If it's any consolation, while you have roundtime, you can still transmit on the
op channel, and use say! So, you would be able to talk with someone on your
einrophone, assuming you made the connection with them before you started
grappling a chunk, and you'd be able to talk to your salvage op peoples about
their favorite outfit selections and whether or not someone showered that
particular day. Those are pretty major avenues, in my opinion. If you want to
talk on the other comm channels and it's something really pressing, you can
always just type @abort, say what you want to say, then resume your grappling.

Oh I found the workarounds.  I'm just saying it doesn't make much sense, the
game is after all about roleplay and communication, not spamming grapple
commands till a meteor falls apart.
I've had many times I have to cancel or @abort, just to respond to a question. 
Yet I could salvage normally and not miss a step.
The game automatically goes back to the picking sections and angles.  That time
in between when you're using the equipment, should be free talk time.

If the game was not a roleplaying game there would probably be no way out of
grappling a chunk in order to respond to a roleplay situation at all. As it is,
I think the work-arounds are there precisely for the situation you described in
the original post of this thread.

a lot of stuff seems to be so you can't script. because people have scripted
grappeling. and it's no different than having round time when firing weapons, or
doing stuff in a battle suit. or when out retrieving an artifact. the list goes
on. it's not something that will more than likely ever change. because round
time is needed. I see it as you're working a rather bulky claw like thing on
something possibly dangerous like a roid, commet or shipwreck. hense the need
for the round time while you work what ever it is.

Pressing 'C' for 'CANCEL' is inconsequential. If you can't recall where you were
grappling on the chunk, then do try to keep track of things and guess what, most
clients allow you to review your last commands entered at some amazing number of
instances. As you stated, all of this is to prevent scripting because so many
don't want to put forth the necessary effort to execute a few commands.

One thing to consider is that the roundtime may, in fact, be because you're busy

[MTTS] dragonfire: You got it Lindsey. Thanks for making us really cool and
awesome host talkers. Not thanks for taking it away haha.
[MTTS] Lindsey Gaiman: It was us. The hosts. The root cause after a lot of
digging turned out to be that every host was supposed to hear every channel..
and event npcs counted as hosts. And there's a few hundred of them. So
communicators created load on the game as if there were about five hundred
people online.

[MTTS] moose: Ouch.
[MTTS] TylerK: Word.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Ok then Shule should I give you the

error and move on and acknowledge that you did learn something. Right now, I

only one. I wrote toh im immediately when he announced the expedition and heard
nothing. Then he announced that he had chosen his crew and that we all should
have gotten confirmation letters, but I did not, so I wrote him again and asked
him if he received my first letter. He wouldn't even answer that."

then he soulhd have sent me some info."
[Starseekers] Corey Matthews transmits, "It sucks. Pilots shouldn't be that way
to each other. He could have at least told me I'm sorry I don't think you are
suitable for my expedition. I would have been a little mad but it would have
been better than total silence."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Well true Shule when you keep walking
out and sending me letters saying it's over and ended, then it tells me you had
a reason for wanting out. I'm the only one who ever tried to get us back

Bert the hefty blue soldier felo marches in from the airlock.
[Starseekers] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I will. I learned something from that,
though. Pushing myself to the limits while flying through deep space is not a
good idea, and I need to regulate how long I stay out."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Seriously building trust means let's
work this out because I care or even love you enough and it is worthwhile but I

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
