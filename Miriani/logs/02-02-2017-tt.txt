-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow
bowl, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the
collar and a pair of sparkly white leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and
an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond. Her head,
face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

Hello. Ever want to see what's in the other direction from the core? Well, feel
free to join my expedition to find out.
We are leaving either one week after Melinda's trip returns, but no earlier than
march 1. The crew so far is Myself, Sean, Melinda, Aisling, Lillian, and Evenia.
If you have recieved a letter from me, or just want to go, feel free to contact
me in writing so I can fit you in. Preference will go to people who can't, or
don't go on trips often.
Space may be unlimited, but quarters aboard the ship aren't, so write me soon
before all the good bunks are taken!

parts with money! Always money. Oh wait, somethings may require golden taels.

which I will discuss privately with the perspective buyer."

buyer's soul?"
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "The letter is sent."

else fund the arrow causing a security risk."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They're literally being offered
free money."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, souls are worthless. You're
not buying anything tangible. Just some lame thing that some religious nutjobs
still believe in."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Erik, I think the concern is in
sharing the design."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What about their first born?
Oh wait...they'd have to retire for that..."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Aha."

would have the resources to build starships."

corporations that build ships. Allied Starships, owned by Agnarr's Interstellar
Siege Force Rental is one."

another."

Security, Hermes Communications..."

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, a round white rattan
coffee table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a small
purple trash bin, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing
yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, Purr
the humanoid service robot, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I say work towards an avenger
instead."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not one I can really work for.
Apparently my record is not...uhm...good enough for a pincer, so I'm highly
doubtful I'd be able to get an Avenger."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Isn't the avenger a destroyer
though?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It is."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But it's an app ship."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So is the pincer."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My point exactly."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can dooooo it."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yeah, my point is that the
avenger isn't as big as a pincer, no?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "As big of a deal."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's not up to me, Ather. And
Erik, that doesn't really matter."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So, they'd be more likely to
grant it to you?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just prove you deserve it.
That's a big part of the application."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not necessarily."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, not exactly sure how to
do tht."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "By the way, I never got the
coupon for the cheesey fries."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Run beacon drops. Fight off
sector sieges. Help defend if we get otherwise attacked. Etc, etc."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, I do that."
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a
small plastic statue of a Jinu.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Good man."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm wondering if it's because
it took me awhile to begin combat flying. There's nothing I can do about that
now. I fly now, and I fly as much as I get the opportunity."

[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "Ather."
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many

pretty major impacts on the decision."
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "Ather."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They never say. You're expected
to figure it out!"
[General Communication] Chase Marshall transmits, "Hi Aisling!"

with it. But I don't know how I could have answered anything differently."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aisling, what do you want from
my life!?"
[General Communication] Chase Marshall transmits, "Your life, perhaps?"

night for sure though."

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Were you good with the setup
last night?"
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "How much tael for double
hull plant?"
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "It was fine."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think it was ultimately a
success."
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "A few moments of panic.
Otherwise fine."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We'll just have to get you to a
higher tieer soon."
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "I have 467 ground
combat."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We figured it out and resolved
it all! That's what counts."
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "How much tael for double
hull plant?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No tael for plants, just 150
million EAOS."
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "You do not want tael
instead?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It goes to mighty org."
[General Communication] Aisling an Sionnach transmits, "Oh. Right. Yes."
