-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport
Landing Pad.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a dusky pink rattan
cabinet, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy
deep purple hangings with a set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
and a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt on it, a large oval dark purple
and light purple cloth rug, a small seashell pink trash can, a small red ball
containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and a small oval turquoise rattan
table with a glass top here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

the fresh new look of the spaceport. All the shops lining the concourse are
closed at the moment, with only a few essential services remaining open. The
spaceport security office is to the northeast, the landing pad to the east, the
local Tesla branch is through an exit to the south. In addition, the spaceport's
Xenology Center is through a doorway to the southeast.

apparently gone home for the duration. Just to the west is a secondary entrance
to the spaceport, with a large pillar just outside. A few bewildered tourists
and travelers come through occasionally, but most of the people present are

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Praying Mantis"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself
through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Oh too, I don't think he can drop out of
the inserter and jump back to 285 either."
'No, I don't think he has a rift drive.
You say, "No, I don't think he has a rift drive."

[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Alko, do you have a rift
drive?"
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I wish."

A medium-sized semi-transparent ovoid creature with short dangling tendrils and
a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate
flag.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would not advise trying to go
back with minimal power if you don't have enough speed. Otherwise, there is a
real possibility you might end up getting stranded some random spot."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "The point is the speed, why
it's going down, that beacuse of the power is getting low?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No, it's just bad riftflow."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, since you're already on
your way, there is no point in my warning. Good luck! Hope you don't have to
self-destruct the ship."
'Well, if he runs out of charge, he may get stranded in some random spot
anyways.
You say, "Well, if he runs out of charge, he may get stranded in some random
spot anyways."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What does your ETA say?"
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
tra gen Alko, go shut off weapons, damage control, and communications in your
engineering room. It may help.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Alko, go shut off weapons,
damage control, and communications in your engineering room. It may help."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Might as well shut off life
support too, if you don't have pets in there, I guess. Just stay in your
spacesuit."
tra gen That was going to be my next suggestion.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That was going to be my next
suggestion."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Darn, yeah, he seriously has
the flow against him. That sucks."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Could always take a carrier out
to catch him mid-way."
tra gen He can't drop out of the rift unless he runs out of charge.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "He can't drop out of the rift
unless he runs out of charge."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "An onboard beacon could catch
him."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Wish I had turned my comms on 5
minutes earlier, I would have suggested he'd stay put. Recharge station going up
in a few minutes for anyone else who needs it."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hopefully powering down those
systems will give him what he needs to get back."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I've never needed to use a
charge booster, how much charge does that give?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Alko how's it looking?"
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Enough for a jump basically."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It won't matter. If he has to
use a charge booster, he's already going to be virtually stranded in space."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Darn, that sucs!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Pretty sure you can't use a
charge booster until you're drained dry."
[General Communication] Emmett Lee transmits, "As far as I know, you can not."
tra gen You can't.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You can't."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have been able to within 5

for awhile until I ran out of boosters."
'Ah, ok.
You say, "Ah, ok."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, maybe, then."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I could have crafted more but I figured
I had no other options at that time."
nod
You nod.
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ping."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Monitor your charge very
closely then, Alko. At five minutes, pop in a booster."
tra gen Well, I hope he heard my suggestion and powered down those systems.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, I hope he heard my
suggestion and powered down those systems."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Yeah I saw it."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh, what did I wake up to?"
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah you won't need damage
control or weapons in the inserter."
tra gen Oh good
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh good."
tra gen Hi Eve.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi Eve."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Heya shule."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "How's your charge since you
powered down what we told you to power down?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Or comms for that matter."

You nod. "That's what I told him to power down, weapons, damage control, and
comms."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Good."
Lily Kaise smiles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I thought it was
going to be a charger, not a repairer?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is both."
'And Ather suggested life support before I could .
You say, "And Ather suggested life support before I could."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh."
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around
a plastic frond of light green sea fern.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah provided he doesn't have felo

You grin.
Lily Kaise grins.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It has an accelerated
starship charger and a microdrone repair facility, and will be online for 15
days."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "For all you roid haulers and
possibly salvagers or who knows, a new recharge and repair station is up at
285."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We generally keep
repair up out there when we have an op station so we'll likely have another up
when Melinda and her crew get back."
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings
itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it
withdraws.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks Kim."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Should just toss up a
fusion station in the future with a basic charger and a message top or
something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, I imagined as
much, so put repair on there while I was at it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "One could do that yeah as the basic
takes like 20 power."
'right
You say, "Right."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I heard the ping, not sure
where is it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I will consider that
option next time, we will see."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Nice to have both of those out there
though as some do occasionally get hit by pirates."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Are you okay Alko?"
nod 'Yeah
You nod. "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think you can
squeeze a basic repairer and charger on a fusion? I dunno, though."
tra gen He's attempting to eek out every bit of charge to get home.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "He's attempting to eek out
every bit of charge to get home."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Don't think so I
thought basic uses 20 and you have to accomodate the top and then the repair."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I could just like...Go get
him in a carrier. That's less of a risk."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You really can't. He's already
under way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Next time I visit
that store, I will check again, but I think Lily is right."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Actually I went out of the
rift, and I think there is no way of getting, back, yeah?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You went out of the rift?"
tra gen No, not iwthout a rift rive.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No, not iwthout a rift rive."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Alko I see you stopped there."

[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok."
'holy crap
You say, "Holy crap."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "It'll be a few minutes. I need
to cover the last bit the slow way."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, I suppose it is
theoretically possible for someone to find you, but well. Good luck to you and
them."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'm 13.67 light-mincycles from
you now."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I've done this before, Ather."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eww autovector."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Yup."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Never had the patience for all
that exactness."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Alko if you want to start
autovector movement to the east, that'll cut down the time a little."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I have more patience than I
know what to do with sometimes."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Problem is, once he's out of
charge, you won't be able to see him anymore."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yesterday I experienced how
glad I am that I installed a rift drive on my roid hauler, and that it has
plenty of charge."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I don't have the upgrade."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "He's got a charge booster, so he
can pop that."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Oh, nevermind then Alko."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I'm not all THAT far off."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "13 light minutes? Isn't that
like 500 or more sectors?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Good day, pilots and everyone
else with a super expensive metachannel communicator."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Light-mincycles."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "13 mincycles is still a long
way to autovec."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Keegan."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's not too bad, then. He
should be able to stay alive long enough."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Not an unreasonable distance
though, Johann."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "No, it's doable."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I have lots of boosters."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Well you won't need all of them.
Just sit tight."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I can just try manually go
east for a little."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "If you want to, sure."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "That will help."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Every sector or two will
probably help."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "This flow seriously sucks. With
an accelerator, you usually don't need half an hour back from 285."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Sometimes stuff doesn't go our
way, that's all."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, tough luck."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "I am going!"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Alko, I recommend getting an
autovector unit if you intend to keep artifacting."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Manually going sector by sector
is crazy."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "And super slow."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think he was asteroid
hauling."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Yeah ather he was."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Oh."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "Hell I put an autovector unit on
my fighter, and that's just to get from the Torus to the BAS."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And now Akemi is trying to find
him, because he's almost out of charge."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Another day, another
crisis. There should be a series about us on the holovid for all the world to
see, "Real Stories of the Civilian Pilot Corps.""
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "But then they don't like
us much anyway."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I put an autovector on anything
that I can put one on."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Autovector still applies to
'roid haulers if you're going to stick close."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I have vector on
everything."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Well, guys let' agree that
money talks."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "We should put autovector on our
autovector units, so that we can autovector while we autovector."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "All mine says is
goodbye."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's okay Alko. Don't worry
about it. We'll get you sorted out."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "And she has about 406 sectors
to travel total."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am rather indifferent to
autovector."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "I really wish I had finer sail
controls than 1% trim."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I like things that make my
life easier. However, I don't normally use it when asteroid hauling."
[General Communication] Johann Rowan transmits, "Agreed, that would help."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "If money talks you need to see
a psychiatrist."
[General Communication] Akemi Bando transmits, "What about if a coke bottle
sings?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Then you're in the rift."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I guess money can talk in the
rift, too."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I'm more used to furniture
screaming, though."

saving, I figured GST wouldn't change either, but figured I'd check my watch
any."

play too much SC."

Hello pilots! Allied Libertarians is looking to do some trading at Andy's this
next week. We are taking two ships, and have room for up to ten additional
pilots. If you too are in need of Tael, send myself or Sean Sloan a letter.
Departure time is Thursday November tenth, 2316 at 02:00.
We are running a pet friendly trip this time, but please keep it reasonable.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" and the two-person light
transport "The Light Monkey" are landed here.

Hello Johann,
Shule and I would like to go along on the trip to Andy's. We're curious to know
what ships you will be taking? We were considering just following in my Platform
as Shule and I would just go on from Andy's to Tom Town later and then over to
an Artifacting field called Sea of Fears which isn't far from Tom Town. I am
assuming you will be docking ships of trade goods in a carrier if a carrier is
what you will be taking? If there's 60 units available, then we could just dock
my platform and enjoy the trip out with you? Otherwise, we can reduce trim to
follow as the Platform is a bit faster and we'd get a bit ahead if we didn't
reduce trim.
Please let me know and if you need to contact me by phone, my number is
001071115 and Shule's is 0010-18113.
This should be fun!
Lily

l eve
Evenia Callseah
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and
has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled
calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips
are full and applied with gold lipstick, and occasionally part to reveal a set
of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and
wide. Her ankle-length, curly hair is glittering gold with crimson streaks and
plaited into numerous braids all over her head. She has long clear fingernails.
She has a hissing tarantula, a sprinkling of tiny multicolored crystals, several
dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather,
and several glossy black raven feathers hanging from a length of braided red
leather in her hair.
A sparkling diamond stud pierces her left cheek, a curved gold barbell with a
small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces
her tongue, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her right cheek, a pair of slender
gold rings pierces her right upper ear, a pair of slender gold rings pierces her
left upper ear, a thick platinum ring pierces her left eyebrow, a small enameled
red skull pierces her right earlobe, and a small enameled red skull pierces her
left earlobe.
 She is wearing a buckled black leather choker with a triple row of steel claw
studs, a double-breasted black leather trench coat, a black leather bustier
decorated with jeweled red Celtic knots, a pair of dangerous-looking black
leather forearm bands with eleven rows of very long darkly gleaming steel claw
studs, a pair of classically loose-fitting black leather pants, and a pair of
stompy black leather cross-strapped boots. She is also wearing a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a silvery band inset with a
real ruby, a personal filing computer, a metallic gold wrist-mounted
chronometer, a scorched metal thigh holster, a dazzling bracelet of brilliant
sapphires and diamonds, a fine gold link necklace with a glowing black crystal
spider pendant, a delicate gold link bracelet with a single clear crystal spider
suspended from it, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a white stone amulet hanging
from a black leather cord, a black steel skull keyring, a gleaming gold Li ring,
and a Tardick lizard named Zeus perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both
eyes, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Evenia Callseah asks in an Ars Magnan accent, "Where the hell did this come
from?"
Sean Sloan says in an Old Earth accent, "Hell."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Chemeketa"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Vengeance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
