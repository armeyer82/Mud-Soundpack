11:43 [Newbie] Aealynn Lovlynn: Hello and good morning. I am a brand new player looking for the MUD that's right for me. ANyone on that could spare a little bit to help answer some questions I have about Miriani?

11:45 #$#hjelp

11:46 [Newbie] Erik Yobi: Yes.

11:49 You say to Miriam Valleris, "Bonjour mon coeur et futur femme."

11:49 You cuddle Miriam Valleris gently.

11:49 #$#soundpack social | cuddle | male

11:50 [Newbie] Aealynn Lovlynn: Uhhh before I do that I have a few basic questions. Is this MUD pay to win or have a cash shop? Is there permadeath or auto concent PvP? It was tagged as 'adult' in mud connector so is mudsex completely legal here? Those are pretty much my biggest questions I could not gain answers to so I made this test character.

11:50 You squeeze Miriam Valleris affectionately.

11:50 #$#soundpack social | squeeze | male

11:50 [Newbie] Cassie Knight: Yes, mud sex is legal.

11:50 [Newbie] Mitchell: Donations are encouraged, but completely optional. You'll never be asked to pay real money for anything.

11:51 [Newbie] Mitchell: PVP is limited to destroying starships and stunning/stranding. There's no death.

11:52 Miriam Valleris squeezes you affectionately.

11:52 Miriam Valleris smiles at you.

11:52 #$#soundpack social | smile | female

11:52 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: Yes to the constent pvp/auto pvp,though.

11:53 [Newbie] Mitchell: As for sexual roleplay, yes it's legal. However, players under 18 years of age out of character are not allowed to roleplay sexual encounters of any kind. This is for their protection as well as ours.

11:53 [Private | Auction Service] Auction Service transmits, "A new item is up for bid: A fluffy food robot (r60). Bids will start at 75,000,000.00 credits and the auction will end in 5 days. Good luck!"

11:53 [Newbie] Aealynn Lovlynn: So if I don't like PvP I can opt out. But if I do allow it I'd never get killed.

11:53 #$#hjelp

11:53 [Newbie] Mitchell: You cannot opt out of PVP, no.

11:54 [Newbie] Mitchell: As a new player, you'll be protected from PVP for two days of connected time though.

11:55 [Newbie] Therman Donaldson: Yeah but that protection is limited to you not provoking osmeone.

11:55 [Newbie] Mitchell: This is true.

11:56 [Newbie] Aealynn Lovlynn: I misunderstood. Is PvP a huuuuge aspect of how the game is run? I just don't find it very fun personally mainly because I don't get into competitive things. And well, when you're the new girl and work hard only to get robbed its a huge turn off.

11:56 [Newbie] Mitchell: It's not strictly necessary.

11:57 [Newbie] Mitchell: You'll get combat points through combat missions, not PVP.

11:57 #$#hjelp

11:58 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: See, you don't need to do pvp yourself to advance in the game,however. Others are free to shoot you down just for the heck of it,steel shit off of you,etc.

11:58 [Newbie] Mitchell: Couriering is the exception though. You get points and credits for destroying ships of rival companies.

11:58 [Newbie] Salazar Clayton: There are of course ways you can defend yourself,but in the end it comes down to your reaction speed and skills.

12:05 [Newbie] Aealynn Lovlynn: Fantatsic! Btw my new character will be named Alessondria. I'm a newbie to MUDs too, more or less, so I'll be making use of this channel often. I'll not abuse it or try to be too annoying.

13:32 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "One of these things works normally. Or just, throw him in the cold water if he doesn't want to. I did that with someone who lost his leg, well half of it. He didn't want to try to stand up. So we just put him on the floor and went away, and he felt something for me, not really love i think, it was just that over the months we got to know eachother very well, and didn't want me to go away and then he just tried to stand up. Sometimes people need a little push" ]

13:33 [ You shatter immersion and say, "Very true." ]

13:33 [ Miriam Valleris shatters immersion and says, "It could be hard over Skype since I can tell him a lot of things and maybe be convincing, but I couldn't show him how it could be and I couldn't help him if he fails. That's an important thing too, the person has to know that he'll never be alone with what he does and that if he fails, someone will fix it" ]

My dearest Love,
Honestly Tibo, I would like to give you more credit for having
some sense of better judgement. But based upon the circumstances
involving you and this woman, you sure are naive enough to think
that this selfish woman who moved in on a relationship and
interfered and whose only purpose is to satisfy her own whims and
to gain at your expense. Reliable sources have already informed me
that she sleeps around with anyone she can. I know you won't
believe me but so just ask your friends ... that is if you have any
left. Her offer to repay you was merely to connive you moreso into
thinking she is innocent when I feel certain she was or is working
with Fawkes and Cria and company. If Fawkes can manage to claim
and sell your Transverser, then there's something in it for her at
your expense. If she were being honest and forthright, She should
have offered to repay you for the entire loss and nothing less. If
he claims your Transverser, you won't be able to obtain another
unless you disown it and the AIE considers allowing our Specialty
ships to be claimed by other Alliance pilots as a very serious
offense. You will have to wait for a time before you can obtain
another one. If you think you can catch it, heh good luck! It is
the fastest starship amongst pilots and so you will have to likely
interdict it or get ahead of it and trap it in a mine field which
of course will defeat the purpose of reclaiming it other than if
you can manage to rescue it in time before it is destroyed. Fawkes
is pretty fast and it will take a lot to beat him. I doubt that I
could and i've been around pilots similar to him. One guy was very
similar in his tactics but it took a lot of us to gang-up and beat
him into submission until he gave-in and quit piloting.
Hopefully if you had any droids aboard, you have their remotes as
you should never leave droids just sitting around in starships
carrying their remotes unless they are followinng you or you are
out of comms. It's obvious that if your ship is stolen, then if
your droids are aboard, then to the victor goes even more reward
unless they decide to boot them and it's not likely Fawkes will do
this.
You should have thought better of any suggestion to move your
Transverser from Acrylon or a safe sector at all and especially in
a slow Gunship. You could have independently flown it to wherever
you wanted and outrun Fawkes. I've been chased before by Battle
Cruisers in my Transverser and what was in it for me was a lot of
laughs. just think about it. Oh Tibo Darling let's just load your
trannie into your gunship and take it to my house. Of course had
you managed to reach the destination, you could still retrieve it
if she didn't manage to let someone else in first to steal it.
I find this so insulting that you should run to such a low life.
Had you found a better woman than me, the heart-break wouldn't be
any different but I could at least acknowledge and eventually
accept it that you found someone who would be decent and honorable
and true and who isn't self-serving only towards her own benefit.
Yes, I was wrong for not being persistent to remain in your ship
and hold onto you. i just thought if it meant something to you
that you would come for me and apologize for your behavior towards
me but i just wanted to go off and cry. I would have been willing
to talk things over with you but I was so baffled as what did I do
to ever deserve this? Absolutely nothing except that I wasn't
ready for being totally intimate. Wow that is such a selfish
excuse don't you think? You had every opportunity to discuss it
with me and to ask me rather than to be spiteful and punative
towards me. I did nothing wrong yet you behave as though I did.
In all of this, I am so sorry for you and for your losses. However,
i am not sorry that you got your ass kicked bigtime. you deserved
it and I wish I would have grabbed you and stunned and stranded you
over your abject and utter stupidity and horrible disgrace of
judgement. This is something I sensed could happened especially
when you foolishly lost your gunship to Cria. Still, I also
thought you learned a dear lesson concerning not to give blanket
trust to someone you really don't know. It's clear that 24 by 7 sex
rules you and sex is more important to you though which is why I
said I'd have more respect for you if you would think with your
head rather than your penis as your penis is certainly where your
judgement is at this time. I trusted you with my own ships as I
didn't think you would behave so wrecklessly with any of my ships
and thankfully so.
This doesn't mean that i don't love you as I will admit it that i
will never stop loving you even though it's foolish. I love your
affections but once hurt by someone I loved deeply, I wanted to be
certain that he wouldn't betray me and treat me as you have. So
yes I so want you back but it will take a long time for me to feel
that I can really trust you and that you will be faithful. When I
love someone I love with everything and I am forever loyal. I
don't place conditions on how much sex I'll have or how much the
other person is worth. i just love the whole person and knowing
that we are imperfect human beings in an even less perfect
Universe, we must accept that at times one may have to give more
than the other at times. I am willing to give more to forgive you
although I won't forget it. You are a very wonderful person and I
guess I would like to think that you are prone to not thinking very
logically at times. Here someone who works with others as an envoy
to exploit vulnerabilities in guys and women too. When Fawkes does
sell the ship if he can, She gets a cut of the profit. I can see
by her track record that she is no prize to the Commonwealth in
terms of productivity towards the defense of humanity or other
aspects.
Tibo, if sex 24 by 7 is your priority then why did you become a
pilot in the first place?
Last, I would like to go out of the area for awhile in a week or
two. Since you have a huge financial loss to deal with, it isn't
going to be easy for you to recoup those losses with Fawkes et al
hunting you. You are welcome to join me but she is not. You will
not even be able to disclose the date, time nor point where we are
leaving from to her as well as she will only inform Fawkes and
company to chase us. Sorry if this angers you but blindly going
along with the demands of your sexual partner are cause enough for
me to have to say these things. Otherwise, yes, I would assume as
I used to, that you would keep any of my plans confidential even if
you are involved.
I have no plans to stun or strand you either. I'm just relating my
utter frustration with the fact that something has obviously not
provided a sufficient enough of a wake-up call that you need to be
more guarded of your assets with someone you don't know as well as
me. You can trust me though because I don't need anything of yours
nor anyone else's. She on the other hand is too lazy to work hard
for what she wants and relies on more shady methods and for this,
she will always have just enough to get by.
I love you,
Kitty

My dearest Love,
Honestly Tibo, I would like to give you more credit for having
some sense of better judgement. But based upon the circumstances
involving you and this woman, you sure are naive enough to think
that this selfish woman who moved in on a relationship and
interfered and whose only purpose is to satisfy her own whims and
to gain at your expense. Reliable sources have already informed me
that she sleeps around with anyone she can. I know you won't
believe me but so just ask your friends ... that is if you have any
left. Her offer to repay you was merely to connive you moreso into
thinking she is innocent when I feel certain she was or is working
with Fawkes and Cria and company. If Fawkes can manage to claim
and sell your Transverser, then there's something in it for her at
your expense. If she were being honest and forthright, She should
have offered to repay you for the entire loss and nothing less. If
he claims your Transverser, you won't be able to obtain another
unless you disown it and the AIE considers allowing our Specialty
ships to be claimed by other Alliance pilots as a very serious
offense. You will have to wait for a time before you can obtain
another one. If you think you can catch it, heh good luck! It is
the fastest starship amongst pilots and so you will have to likely
interdict it or get ahead of it and trap it in a mine field which
of course will defeat the purpose of reclaiming it other than if
you can manage to rescue it in time before it is destroyed. Fawkes
is pretty fast and it will take a lot to beat him. I doubt that I
could and i've been around pilots similar to him. One guy was very
similar in his tactics but it took a lot of us to gang-up and beat
him into submission until he gave-in and quit piloting.
Hopefully if you had any droids aboard, you have their remotes as
you should never leave droids just sitting around in starships
carrying their remotes unless they are followinng you or you are
out of comms. It's obvious that if your ship is stolen, then if
your droids are aboard, then to the victor goes even more reward
unless they decide to boot them and it's not likely Fawkes will do
this.
You should have thought better of any suggestion to move your
Transverser from Acrylon or a safe sector at all and especially in
a slow Gunship. You could have independently flown it to wherever
you wanted and outrun Fawkes. I've been chased before by Battle
Cruisers in my Transverser and what was in it for me was a lot of
laughs. just think about it. Oh Tibo Darling let's just load your
trannie into your gunship and take it to my house. Of course had
you managed to reach the destination, you could still retrieve it
if she didn't manage to let someone else in first to steal it.
I find this so insulting that you should run to such a low life.
Had you found a better woman than me, the heart-break wouldn't be
any different but I could at least acknowledge and eventually
accept it that you found someone who would be decent and honorable
and true and who isn't self-serving only towards her own benefit.
Yes, I was wrong for not being persistent to remain in your ship
and hold onto you. i just thought if it meant something to you
that you would come for me and apologize for your behavior towards
me but i just wanted to go off and cry. I would have been willing
to talk things over with you but I was so baffled as what did I do
to ever deserve this? Absolutely nothing except that I wasn't
ready for being totally intimate. Wow that is such a selfish
excuse don't you think? You had every opportunity to discuss it
with me and to ask me rather than to be spiteful and punative
towards me. I did nothing wrong yet you behave as though I did.
In all of this, I am so sorry for you and for your losses. However,
i am not sorry that you got your ass kicked bigtime. you deserved
it and I wish I would have grabbed you and stunned and stranded you
over your abject and utter stupidity and horrible disgrace of
judgement. This is something I sensed could happened especially
when you foolishly lost your gunship to Cria. Still, I also
thought you learned a dear lesson concerning not to give blanket
trust to someone you really don't know. It's clear that 24 by 7 sex
rules you and sex is more important to you though which is why I
said I'd have more respect for you if you would think with your
head rather than your penis as your penis is certainly where your
judgement is at this time. I trusted you with my own ships as I
didn't think you would behave so wrecklessly with any of my ships
and thankfully so.
This doesn't mean that i don't love you as I will admit it that i
will never stop loving you even though it's foolish. I love your
affections but once hurt by someone I loved deeply, I wanted to be
certain that he wouldn't betray me and treat me as you have. So
yes I so want you back but it will take a long time for me to feel
that I can really trust you and that you will be faithful. When I
love someone I love with everything and I am forever loyal. I
don't place conditions on how much sex I'll have or how much the
other person is worth. i just love the whole person and knowing
that we are imperfect human beings in an even less perfect
Universe, we must accept that at times one may have to give more
than the other at times. I am willing to give more to forgive you
although I won't forget it. You are a very wonderful person and I
guess I would like to think that you are prone to not thinking very
logically at times. Here someone who works with others as an envoy
to exploit vulnerabilities in guys and women too. When Fawkes does
sell the ship if he can, She gets a cut of the profit. I can see

Kitty, 
It's amazing how much of your story is mistaken and / or based on assumptions. If this is seriously the way you intend to earn my heart back, it's doing the exact opposite. You know, I'd believe your assertions about Miriam more if you got your story and facts straight. This is the problem. You want me to believe what you're telling me, yet I know for a fact that you are telling me things based on misinformation. So, how do you expect me to believe what you say about her? Get the true facts and then I'll be more likely to believe you.
You claim I'm thinking with my penis and not my head. So, if Miriam is really working with Fawkes and Cria, and she would get a cut of the profits, why did she give me credits to help me get my Transverser back? This makes no sense! Second, we were not taking my Tranny to her house, not sure why you jumped to that conclusion, but you were wrong. I have my Transverser and it is safely parked on Acrylon. Go check it out! Actually, go track it! It's still available for you to track! So Fawkes has it? Really and his going to sell it? Really? Miriam is going to get a cut of the profits from a ship that Fawkes doesn't have possession of, but he's going to sell? Hmmm, doesn't seem very logical now does it? How is that going to work? I really hope Miriam gets a lot for that ship because she'd have to make sure she was going to at least get bak the 450 million credits she gave me to help get it back. Sorry Kitty, but I honestly doubt that Fawkes could get enough money  from selling my tranny to be able to pay Miriam, or anyone for that matter, more than 450 million credits and still keep a sizable profit.
I don't know who told you that Miriam sleeps with whomever she can, but since the two of us got together, she has never left my side except to go buy a hatch repair kit to fix my blown hatch on my tranny. So, who is she sleeping with while she's by my side? I'd be curious to know. I don't trust what people say about others all of the time. I need proof. Yes, there are devious, heartless and selfish people out there, but what tells you people don't just say things out of spite because they heard it from someone else? I want tangible evidence before making accusations. Otherwise, it's simply defaming someone's character without grounds, something I do not tolerate in the very least.
One last note, I now know who owns the house where Miriam and I are residing and they have not taken very nicely to the names you have called his house. For someone who doesn't want to make waves, you'll create some if you continue to call it what you have and I'll have nothing to do with it. So, you know what? Do yourself a favor and get your facts straight, do your research from reliable sources, gather your tangible evidence, and I consider believing your story. Otherwise, , I have no choice but to question it seeing as major ar
18:07 guments you have are invalid, incomplete, and / or inaccurate.

So, if Miriam is really working with Fawkes and Cria, and she would get a cut of the profits, why did she give me credits to help me get my Transverser back? This makes no sense! Second, we were not taking my Tranny to her house, not sure why you jumped to that conclusion, but you were wrong. I have my Transverser and it is safely parked on Acrylon. Go check it out! Actually, go track it! It's still available for you to track! So Fawkes has it? Really and his going to sell it? Really? Miriam is going to get a cut of the profits from a ship that Fawkes doesn't have possession of, but he's going to sell? Hmmm, doesn't seem very logical now does it? How is that going to work? I really hope Miriam gets a lot for that ship because she'd have to make sure she was going to at least get bak the 450 million credits she gave me to help get it back. Sorry Kitty, but I honestly doubt that Fawkes could get enough money  from selling my tranny to be able to pay Miriam, or anyone for that matter, more than 450 million credits and still keep a sizable profit.
I don't know who told you that Miriam sleeps with whomever she can, but since the two of us got together, she has never left my side except to go buy a hatch repair kit to fix my blown hatch on my tranny. So, who is she sleeping with while she's by my side? I'd be curious to know. I don't trust what people say about others all of the time. I need proof. Yes, there are devious, heartless and selfish people out there, but what tells you people don't just say things out of spite because they heard it from someone else? I want tangible evidence before making accusations. Otherwise, it's simply defaming someone's character without grounds, something I do not tolerate in the very least.
One last note, I now know who owns the house where Miriam and I are residing and they have not taken very nicely to the names you have called his house. For someone who doesn't want to make waves, you'll create some if you continue to call it what you have and I'll have nothing to do with it. So, you know what? Do yourself a favor and get your facts straight, do your research from reliable sources, gather your tangible evidence, and I consider believing your st
18:07 ory. Otherwise, , I have no choice but to question it seeing as major arguments you have are invalid, incomplete, and / or inaccurate.

My dearest Love,
no, my impression of her are not based upon assumptions. I could
send you the transcript from conversations I have had where it was
said that she sleeps around. However nobody said I could relate
this and I don't break confidences. Of course she's not catting
for another man right now because you are her current
entertainment. So wake up and get off the defensive as I of
course initially did not think very highly of this individual you
are obsessing over but this statement was made voluntarily by this
person who you know quite well and from a couple of others who you
don't readily associate with. The persons themselves, well one who
you know quite well really would likely have no need to make
negative statements about her character as they are happily
involved. So don't you also make assumptions concerning my
assessment here. As what i have stated is factual.
450 Million is all she would give you? Well at least she offered
and did give you credits. no matter where you were going with the
Transverser, unless you know you can avoid predators like Fawkes,
Cria and others, then be certain that you jump as directly to the
desired sector as possible or enjoy being chased. I'm glad you got
it back. You don't see me cavorting my Transverser around the
sectors do you? It's for these same reasons. I love that ship
but it's an old one and I treasure it so I will treat it with
respect and care. If I happen to lose it, it won't be through
careless flying about in Locals where it's not needed in the first
place.
As for whose house it is, I really don't care but I am entitled to
my own opinion of the name. If I were to buy a house by that name,
I would change its name. It doesn't come across as being the least
bit romantic-sounding. It sounds like an old-fashioned whore house
and nothing more. Good that whomever it belongs to has another
idea but there's nothing elegant about the name of that house
whether you like my impression or or not, it is what it is. If
it's yours, then you know what i think.
I don't see that I should have to win your heart back if I truly
had it before. Again I thought I could believe in you and give you
more credit for being a committed and caring man. That you loved
me unconditionally which is obviously not the case. people who
truly love don't place the conditions on their love that you have
nor do they go out hunting sex to hurt their faithful partner.
This is just pure selfishness.
As for the character of this individual you are sleeping with, yes
I could have just let you continue to submit you over and over to
destructive and compromising circumstances and laughed. I know it
doesn't matter that I do care and I despise what she is doing to
you for you to get your sexual needs met. It sure sucks to be you
in this but it is clear that you are still controlled by your
19:02 
sexual organ and not logic at all.
I offered to take you out of comms merely to perhaps have some time
for us to work on things or we could have gone together and not
slept together. Knowing too that you've lost a bit, I would feel
guilty about going out and enjoying the total reward on my own yet
i honestly don't mind doing so. I just wanted to help you out but
again, she is not welcome nor will she ever be welcomed aboard my
ships or on my properties.
I love you Tibo,
Kitty
