Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[Starship "Emerald McKay"; Weapons Room One]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.
You see a swiveling black leather gunner's chair here.
You can go southeast.
A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

[Starship "Emerald McKay"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Morris Corlew sits down.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
