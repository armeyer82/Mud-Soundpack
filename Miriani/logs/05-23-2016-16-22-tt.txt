Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Joy Ride"; Control Room]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a large leather couch, a small purple trash can, a sleek stainless steel
beverage machine with purple accents, an insulated purple cooler, an insulated
green cooler, and a Tardick lizard named Athena here.
Rogue Romano and Joel Kringle are sleeping on a large leather couch.
Blake Madison and Lily Kaise are dozing on a large leather couch. Melinda

[Starship "Joy Ride"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a large leather couch, a small purple trash can, a sleek stainless steel
beverage machine with purple accents, an insulated purple cooler, an insulated
green cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, and a white microwave oven
here.
Rogue Romano is sleeping on a large leather couch.
Blake Madison is dozing on a large leather couch. Joel Kringle, Melinda
Michaels, and Lily Kaise are sitting on a large leather couch.
You can go south and out.

Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "Fater rift, faster."
Melinda says to Joel, "I charted but I ain't telling."
Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a large mug of hot hazelnut coffee with whipped
cream and cinnamon.
Joel says, "No, that's perfect."
Joel says, "I didn't want to know or anyone other than you."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "Dir 90 0."
Joel chuckles.
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "No."
Joel Kringle activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive
detections and recent ping returns.
Joel gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "I can has to
hypercasting, I swear probably maybe."
"Well," says Melinda, "I know which one that is."
Joel says, "I think we're going to have to angle eastward at some point."
rift loc
You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.
There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's
nothing but vacuum all around.
Melinda says, "Yeah I don't think the flow has been west at all."
Joel says, "Not that I can remember."
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "I'll go with maybe."
Lily asks, "So about how far have we traveled?"
Melinda says, "Like 127 light-years."
[Newbie Help] Sakura Arakida transmits, "When did it become 20 mill to referb a
battlesuit, I thought referb used to only be 1 mill. For a tier 1, 2 mill for a
tier 2... or did I miss something somewhere?"
Lily says, "Wow not too far to the 150 mark then."
"I'm hesitant to change the elevation because the flow has been pushing up most
of the way as well," Joel says. "When we get to about two hundred light-years
probably switch to 275, -2."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "It goes up as your suits get more
complex."
"Okay," says Melinda.
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "She lives!"
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "If a mule explodes with a fort on it,
what happens to the fort, and is there a command to retreave it?"
[Newbie Help] Sakura Arakida transmits, "I know. But it used to be 1 mill for a
tier 1, 2 mill for 2, 3 for 3 and so on and so forth. Or is it different with a
rental?"
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "That's a good thing."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "I think the fort hangs out in space and
you have to get another Mule to retrieve it."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "For who?"
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "The fort sits where the mule was lost. I
believe you have to bring a mule without a fort to get it."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Thanks."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "As for the costs to refurbish a suit,
that was changed to how it is now about 3 years ago."
[Newbie Help] Joel Kringle transmits, "I don't remember a suit being that cheap
to refurb beyond a tier one."
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "It depends on who the
she is."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "Ford."
Joel chuckles.
[Newbie Help] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Back in 2012 it was. Guess that's been
tweeked over the past 4 years. Alright."
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Well, I suppose it would
be good for Kringle but he's over here."
Joel chortles.
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Use refurbishment tools, a mule's facility
for repairing suits, or just eat the repair fee."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "I'm fine, I have my very
own party pack right here."
Joel grins.
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "So do we."
Joel says, "Oddly enough I'm still the least dressed person here."
Joel chuckles.
Melinda laughs.

Joel Kringle presses a prominent calibration button on the hypercaster control
board.
Incoming hypercaster calibration ping from Wings at South: Local hypercaster is
currently tuned to Galactic North (90.0, 0.0) and the current power level
settings are 5 percent. Signal strength between this vessel and calibrating
vessel is very strong.
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "I will bet a billion

Lily says, "Forgot to give you that."
Melinda Michaels slides a "Stars Wanderer" key onto a huggy pug keychain.
"Oh just for laughs if you see a planetary system that you are convinced nobody

Melinda says, "I am terrible at naming ships."
'That might be dangerous. You might get some rather strange ship names.
"That might be dangerous," you say. "You might get some rather strange ship
names."
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Aww, nobody's gonna bet
me?"
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "Bet you about what?"
Lily says, "I am obviously not the best and I renamed it when I got the Void
Piercer which I sold several months ago and was the first ting that came to
mind."
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Cilah getting out of her
clothes."
-lily I'm not the best either at naming ships.
You say to Lily, "I'm not the best either at naming ships."

Cilah."
Joel chuckles.

You chuckle.
Lily says to you in a New Earth accent, "You have some interesting ones but some
seem as though they're after old girlfriends back home."
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "That was my bet, that it
wouldn't."
Lily laughs.
[Newbie Help] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Nathaniel falling asleep ic like you do
from an ic standpoint is a medical issue. And if that's the case you wouldn't of
been made a pilot if that happened for a long time like you said. They screan
for mental, and medical issues that affect your ability to be a pilot and fly
exceedingly expensive tech."

You laugh.
Lily cuddles up to you.
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Now we are discussing
old girlfriends."

You cuddle up to Lily.
Lily laughs.
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "I have one of those.
From Lillian."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I don't know how i'm supposed to
explain internet fuck ups. Power is being shit during storms and watever."
-lily Only one is named after a former girlfriend back home, the other is just a
friend.
You say to Lily, "Only one is named after a former girlfriend back home, the
other is just a friend."
Joel Kringle rapidly spins a prominent knob on the hypercaster control board,
and the needle on a backlit analogue needle display slowly falls from 5% to 4%.
Lily grins.
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I was just thinking about that."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Ideally you, and everyone else, would
gloss over it since it is an OOC problem."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I know, but no one is. So I now need
to find an ic reason for something that I can't make sence of."
"Ok safe travels I'll be awake in awhile," Lily says.
It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.
Joel nods.
-lily Rest well
You say to Lily, "Rest well."
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "The reason they're not glossing over it
is because it happens enough to affect many many activities, from beacons to
nests."
Lily smiles at you. "Thanks."
Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your
shoulder.
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I'd just gloss over it when
possible."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "I usually gloss over things like
connection issues where possible, but when a disconnect happens in the middle of
a beacon it's hard to ignore. Not really sure what to do there myself."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I know it does. But we're having
storms and stuff."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "So I can't do much about it. It's
random, so I might be in the middle of anything and splat."
[Newbie Help] Sakura Arakida transmits, "But people, not me, but people haven't
glossed over it akemi. People make issues of it, saying they don't want him on
beacons and such. Best advice, if you know a storm's coming, or if you know
you're going to be away from your computer, don't get involved in stuff. Because
we don't know you're having ooc issues. And that kills emersion. So from an ic
standpoint what you're doing does look really bad and does cast doubt on the
vetting process if they let someone in with a sleeping disorder."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Might be better to stick to
activities that the disconnect won't affect quite so hard, like asteroid mining,
when you have storms and such."
[Newbie Help] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Or small tesla sites."
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Well, it's hard to ignore something
like that from an ic standpoint multiple times. I'm not really sure how we
should handle it, because we all know it's net issues, but the char suddenly
becoming unresponsive enough times that it causes a lot of problems?"
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah, solo Tesla, though if you
disconnect at the wrong time you might wake up in a wrecked suit. I did that
once."
who
There appear to be about 3 pilots recently active.
The starship's computer detects:
*Shule Elemmire  (A)
*Joel Kringle  (L)
*Melinda Michaels  (L)
* == Out of communications range
Additionally, there are 2 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but
have not recently been active.
Final total: 5 pilots.
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I don't know what to do. Perhaps I
should just stop playing untill shit clears up."
[Newbie Help] Simon Collins transmits, "And there's weather forcasts. Storm
forcasts are usually quite acurate in this day and age."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just from my perspective, I think I'd
just keep an eye on weather. If something's coming in, then do something
low-commit. If it's totally random and not weather related, like an ISP issue,
there's not much you can do."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Well, yeah. But you don't know wyen
ther gonna hit. And my phone always says no weather data for your location is
available."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Use a web service like weather underground
then."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Get something like dark sky."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "When i'm at home it's not a problem.
But i'm not. I'm at a school."
[Newbie Help] Damien Alexander transmits, "Weather Underground is my weather
site of choice."
[Newbie Help] Sakura Arakida transmits, "Online, internet, look at the news for
your area. Listen to the news on a TV, there's many many ways."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It'll alert you to any incoming precip."
Joel Kringle rapidly spins a prominent knob on the hypercaster control board,
and the needle on a backlit analogue needle display slowly rises from 4% to 5%.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, if you hear thunder..."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Thanks guys for the ideas for web
survaces."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I will usually avoid high group
activity things during storms. Other than avoidance of beacons and nests when
you are having these issues, I don't know. We've all been disconnected from time
to time but it's the frequency that makes it hard to deal with IC."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I just tried to use the phones default
weather app."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "What's your trim at?"
Melinda Michaels activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive
detections and recent ping returns.
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "It's 95%."
Melinda Michaels activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive

[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I know it is. But yeah. And I am sorry
ooc for it, as people put real time into this game and I have fucked it up for
some people."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "You're slowly falling
behind now. Maybe 97?"
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "There are lots of weather apps, some
might be more voiceover accessible than others. I hope you get it sorted though,
I know how it feels not to have a solid connection."
Joel Kringle says into the hypercaster microphone, "That's pretty neatly
trimmed."
[Newbie Help] Akemi Bando transmits, "Are you playing from your phone?"
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "No, but sometimes, yeah."
[Newbie Help] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's just a game. I hope people
aren't going to really get upset over it."
[Newbie Help] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I know people do."
[Newbie Help] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "Another imersion breaker."
[Newbie Help] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Just enjoy it for the time your able
to play, somethings just can't be helped."
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Watching it."
Melinda Michaels activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive
detections and recent ping returns.
[Newbie Help] Lillian Hudson transmits, "Agreed. Lillian gets upset over it ic,
but separation is a wonderful thing. Anyway, we deal with it the best we can,
but as melinda said, it's hard to ignore with the frequency of it."
Incoming hypercaster transmission from Wings at South: "Yep."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just try to prevent as much as
possible...things we've talked about here. And when you can't, you just can't."
Melinda Michaels turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming
the riftsail to 96%.

gonna go away now."
Melinda laughs.
Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Strawberry."
Joel Kringle says into the hypercaster microphone, "Oh... No one is stopping
you. Feel free to expound on this titillating topic."

[Starship "Joy Ride"; Control Room]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a large leather couch, a small purple trash can, a sleek stainless steel
beverage machine with purple accents, an insulated purple cooler, an insulated
green cooler, a clear plastic food storage container, and a white microwave oven
here.
