00:04 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. You see a large painting in a canvas frame hanging on the wall. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a gray trash can, a shiny white starship simulator, an internal stun turret, Mekensie the droid, a gleaming red security drone, and a slim blue medical drone here.
You can go south and out.

00:04 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Aria the droid, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Serlo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Kulita the droid, Zack the droid, Rage the droid, Spots the droid, Buzz the droid, Booboo the droid, Caly the droid, Vur the droid, a glossy violet medical drone, a compact black security drone, a sleek black hovercraf

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles.

Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

01:31 ["Imminent Demise" Weapons Room 1]
The weapon room, being a highly specialized room, only has two distinct features. The first is a small starmap that is set into the wall. Below it, a single console rests, containing only those controls which are absolutely necessary for the control of the weapons. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see a deep aqua gunner's chair here.
You see Kitty Mars here.
You can go east.

Rather than being filled with large machines and grease covered tools, the engineering room is clean and elegant, containing nothing more than a row of consoles.

Occasionally, a soft beep emanates from a console to alert you of some change in the starship's status. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

02:50 ["Undertow" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.
You see a deep aqua captain's chair here.

This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.

You see EmmyLou the droid, Estelle the droid, a massive sandstone fireplace with a mosaic tile hearth and a teakwood mantel, a coral white floral-patterned suede sectional sofa, an ocean blue glass coffee table with a beautiful gold vase holding a dozen red roses and a coral ocean waters scented candle sitting on top of it, a tall hand-painted porcelain matte gold lamp, a tall rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a translucent architectural design simulator, a shiny purple starship simulator, a stack of neatly split logs, a red-haired female nanny bot, an orange and white cat, and an upgrade printout for "Fascination" here.

You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair here.
You can go south.

13:44 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:44 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

13:44 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

13:44 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

13:44 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."
The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."
You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

13:44 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

13:44 The ship is already moving.

13:44 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

13:44 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

13:44 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

13:44 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

13:44 The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

13:44 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

13:44 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

13:44 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

13:44 Sector 15: Miriani (Neutral)

13:44 Galactic Coordinates: (-603126, 40, 507)

13:44 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

13:44 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

13:44 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:44 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

13:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sea Turtle. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

13:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:45 You peer out and see...
[Empanda Station; Docking Bay]
This large docking area is extremely active, with station personnel and pilots alike moving across the white and gray tiled floor. The area echoes with noise, and several starship landing platforms are situated in rows around the center of the space. A wide metallic stairwell curves around the landing platforms in the middle of the bay, the spiral snaking down to a noisy garage below and up to what looks to be a transport station. The starship traffic coming into and out of the station is immense, and the constant loud roar of relativity drives echoing through the area makes conversation nearly impossible. A number of corridors branch away from the busy area, and a team of drones occasionally appear to load supplies onto one of the starships before getting lost among the sea of people flowing in and out of the large shopping plaza to the south.
You see the three-person heliogaster "Galactic Rainbow", the five-person transverser "Wild Blue Yonder", and the one-person expediter "Astrocheetah" landed here.
You see a shiny purple claw machine, Wiggles the droid, Sum the droid, Jimm the droid, Karli the droid, Stalker the droid, Nazma the droid, Peaches the droid, Prince the droid, Meo the droid, Marina the droid, Lisa the droid, Punch the droid, Rat the droid, Android the droid, Fay the droid, Jazmin the droid, Twit the droid, Rar the droid, Acer the droid, Kaitlyn the droid, Nala the droid, Zia

13:45 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:45 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

13:50 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Empanda Station; Docking Bay.

14:01 ["Pebbles" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is in space.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.

16:03 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a dark blue suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Miss Kitty's WildHorse Saloon; Private Garage.

23:12 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

23:12 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.
You hear a loud clang as robotic arms seize the ship and transport it to the landing pad.

23:12 The computer announces, "The subwarp and slip drives have completed their charging cycle."

23:12 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

23:12 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

23:12 The computer announces, "A space station has been detected in the sector."

23:12 You sit down on a dark blue suede captain's chair.

23:12 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

23:12 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

23:12 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

23:12 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

23:13 #$#soundpack_pong

23:13 #$#soundpack_lag 2206

23:13 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

23:13 The computer announces, "Five planets have been detected in the sector."

23:13 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

23:13    Planets:

23:13 [1] Torndano                                      [5, 15, 10]

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

23:13 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Torndano.

23:13 The deck beneath you vibrates slightly as the relativity drive begins accelerating the starship through space.

23:13 The five-person transverser "Frost Fire" has jumped into the sector.

23:13 The starship is already moving.

23:13 The five-person transverser "Frost Fire" has initiated an intrasector wavewarp.

23:13 Would you like to request landing clearance at Torndano?

The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

23:14 #$#soundpack_pong

23:14 You begin the landing sequence.

23:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's surface.

23:14 You should stand up first.

23:14 ["Sea Turtle" Control Room] (indoors) (lying on the floor)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Torndano; Landing Pad.
You see an internal stun turret, a dark blue suede captain's chair, and a dark blue suede co-captain's chair here.

23:14 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

23:14 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

23:15 #$#soundpack_pong

23:15 #$#soundpack_lag 130

23:15 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

23:15 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.
