-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Living Quarters Six]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot
height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
set of lavender silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass
top, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a compact red
refrigerator, a small seashell pink trash can, an insulated green cooler, a

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a mystic purple synthcotton shipsuit and a pair of soft mystic
purple slippers. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced
plastic phone holster, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the
side, a compact metallic purple camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the
front with a glittery pink camera strap, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard
snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both
hands are left uncovered.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure

Lily Kaise laughs.
Aisling the Fox removes a cute little plush calico cat with brilliant green eyes

Akemi Bando says into the PA microphone, "Five planets."

You grin at Lily Kaise.
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, planetary system, you will not
need a complaint for too few planets, you did well."
Kim Saunders grins.
Akemi Bando asks in a strange Japanese accent, "That makes fifteen now total?"

You grin at Kim Saunders.
Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it
for a moment.
-kim I shall retract my complaint.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Pierre will be pleased."
You say to Kim, "I shall retract my complaint."
Kim Saunders giggles at you. "Good idea."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "He was hoping for more
planets."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "That brings my personal total to,
uhm, 14, I think."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "But we all are."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Seems we're getting them on the way back
at least."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Well, five is half of ten. That works."
nod and smile
You nod and smile.
Lily says to Kim, "So far, we've discovered 21 this trip."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "We can even take different
route home, unexplored."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Should help everyone's coffers, at any
rate."
'definitely
You say, "Definitely."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Maybe return to Mutuality
space instead of Coreward."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Pierre had mentioned it."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "All for that."
smile lily
You smile at Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No hurry to get back."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Let's put it this way, 14 I was
actually awake for and that I saw. The other ones were found when I was
sleeping."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah well you may realize them. Guess
it's up to the Cartographer's."
Lily Kaise smiles.
nod
You nod.
Kim Saunders smiles. "I am not complaining, 14 is a lot of money and a nice
amount of exploration points."
Klaus Stein says in a German accent, "Yup."
Aisling the Fox asks in an unusual Irish accent, "Will the exploration point cap
ever end!?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I don't know, I don't have one yet."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Ok guess we should return to the rift?"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Correction, I have not reached
mine."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Aisling the Fox nods to Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Kim Saunders nods. "I think."
Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 215.0, 0.0.
Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "I think that is where it was?"
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Kim Saunders nods to Lily Kaise.
'Yeah
You say, "Yeah."
The starship has left a unique area of space.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "The last heading?"
Klaus Stein nods.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
Aisling says to Kim, "I have been capped since last trip. Slowly trickling in.
But I have over 3250 exploration points. Far more than any other points."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "And so I am capped."
Klaus Stein says in a German accent, "I think I had around 3300 exploration
before I left."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I have capped often with exploration."
squeeze lily
You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.
Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.
'I had a cap warning just before I left
You say, "I had a cap warning just before I left."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "It matters not much. I am so
far ahead that what is stopping me is industry."
Lily Kaise exclaims in a New Earth accent, "At 6199, I turned in 92 planets so
that was a big wallop!"
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I had 1499 exploration when we
left."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "I have enough exploration to
get an Odyssey. But not industry."
Aisling the Fox grins.
Lily Kaise grins.
grin
You grin.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "You'll get there."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "That darn industry."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Do not want one."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I would have over 20k Industry but I
have put over 4000 into my org so far."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Anfisa can have privilege of
owning possibly only one in fleet."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "The goo pod is not for me."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I have heard about that pod, yeah, I
can imagine not everyone is comfortable with dealing with that and becoming the
ship's eyes and ears, so to speak."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Few have tried at all."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah it's different but I imagine you
learn how to be selective."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Anfisa by far has the most time
doing so."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Some test subject in the
Mutuality who were involved in the design phase. Myself. That's it, so far as I
know."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "I may try at some point if
Anfisa allows. But idea of spending all that time in pod during trip does not
appeal to me. I know tolerance can be built, but I saw how drained Anfisa was
doing it."
Lily Kaise nods.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I like moving about and interacting with
others."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "I am open to experience. But
probably not adopting it as method of travel."
Akemi says to Aisling, "Will talk to you later about it."
Aisling the Fox nods.
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "It does seem like a good exploration trip.
Just very gooey."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "Er, ship."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Well, it does amazing things."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "And you can interact. In a
way."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "I will say, my understanding of
ship systems has improved a lot since I have been integrated into a ship's
systems."
Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "The experience itself I can
see as benefiting."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Give humbling appreciation for
your ship."

The ship's current engine speed is 5079 km/s.
Kim Saunders nods. "Yeah, that I can imagine."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "And very few ships can make it all
the way to Dolia, and back again. Not even sure this Galleon could."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Certainly could."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Yeah, the recharging temp station is
a big plus."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "With ease."
Aisling the Fox nods.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Probably without having to use
that actually."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah I should think so and just put down
a recharge station at some point."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Furnace can be repaired at
Dolia if I am not mistaken."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Hmm, I did not consider that."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "This galleon could make it."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "An Imperator could too."
Lily Kaise nods.
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "If you flew carefully, a
tactical platform could make it."
nod
You nod.
Akemi Bando asks in a strange Japanese accent, "The better question is, what
business do you have at Dolia?"
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah especially with three Long-Range
Sightseers. I have two and have been lazy about applying for the third."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "I don't. I don't even know where it
is. But I was generally speaking."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Well business?"
Lily Kaise looks at Akemi Bando thoughtfully.
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "The flagships do most of the
trading for the clans."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Why would anyone be interested in
visiting a different place?"
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Tourism is nice."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Dolia's for maintaining the
flagship though."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Also, I have heard about the women there
and I know I would enjoy meeting them."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Or, considering Anfisa ever wanted
to go to Dolia, but not want to be stuck in a goo pod the entire trip, just
speculating."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I have great respect for what I have
heard of their culture."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Tell me what you know of Clan
Marzore."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "All that I know is that they are strong
and independent women who have tolerated much and manage to survive."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I don't know about their beliefs nor
other aspects."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Ask Anfisa."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "That could get you killed."
Aisling the Fox grins.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "No I don't htink so."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If Anfisa wants to share with me she
will."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Asking her? No. But knowing
nothing could get you killed if you encounter a clanner who isn't used to
dealing with regs."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "If not, then I don't intrude."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Intrude."
Lily says to Akemi, "So what is your point here? I doubt that anyone of us are
going to strike out for Dolia."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches in from the south.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Not without a proper representative
aboard."
Akemi says to Lily, "If you want to know more about them, you have an excellent
authority about them aboard this very ship."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "Just downstairs, in fact."
Kim Saunders says in a New Bristol accent, "Well, intruding is asking someone
about their deepest secrets. Or could also be asking at the wrong time, when
someone's mind is on something else entirely. But learning about other qcultures
usually only comes when you at least indicate that you wish to learn."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Never learn if you do not ask.
And it is not up to Anfisa to go to you and spell it out if you want to know."
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "I am very much aware and I'm sure the
rest of us are?"
Lily Kaise grins.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "As I say, I don't pry into Anfisa's
business."
Aisling the Fox looks at Akemi Bando and shrugs.
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I believe we all just are eager to be
enlightened when the opportunity arises though."
Akemi Bando says in a strange Japanese accent, "An ignorant crew reflects very
poorly on a clanner who works with regs. Any clanner would not let you go along
on a trip to clan space if you know nothing at all."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "That is very true."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "I ask Anfisa questions all the
time when I get to see her."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "I can't demand of Anfisa though and you
well know that."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "I am still in one piece."
Lily Kaise smiles.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "She is nice to talk to."
Lily says to Aisling, "Well there is one aspect and that is that you are
Mutuality and others of us are not. Anfisa is not fond of AEU."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "So prove her wrong."
Shasta the big onyx soldier felo marches south.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "She will respect you more for
it I think."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Anyway I don't have anything further to
say about this. Was just responding to your question Akemi."

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off
on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky
from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains
of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. A thick band that stretches
across all of the walls at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. Only a handful of tendril-like
cables snake across the walls, unlike most starships. While nothing visibly
holds them against the wall, they refuse to move even if you grip them. The
transparisteel viewport is stretched across the entire fore wall of the room,
but is thinner than usual. Most pilots will spend their time focusing on the
large starmap dominating the left side of the room. Beside the starmap is the
primary control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever. Secondary and tertiary control boards are available in a wide semicircle
around the primary board for greater manipulation of ship systems. The control
room is rather spacious, but the position of the control panels forming an arc
around the small central spot leaves little room for others beyond the pilot. A
thick band that stretches across all of the walls at a seven-foot height
indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a blue velvet sectional sofa, a large secure
xenology storage container, a small blue bioplastic ship light (casting a soft
