02:25 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

02:25 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

02:25 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

02:25 You notify flight control of your desire to undock.

02:25 You're already sitting down.

02:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to undock. Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:25 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.
The computer announces, "Two planets and six space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:25 Your chair doesn't have a seatbelt.

02:25 There are no ships here.

02:25 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

02:25 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:25 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:25 You are suddenly hurled from your sitting position onto the ground.

02:25 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:25 She can lie on a dark blue suede sofa herself.

02:25 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:25 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:25 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

02:25 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

02:25 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

02:26 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

02:26 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

02:26 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 7, 7, 6."

02:26 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

02:26 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

02:26 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

02:26 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

02:26 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

02:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

02:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:26 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

02:26 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

02:26 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Pinnacle; Private Garage.
You see a gleaming red security drone, a slim blue medical drone, an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a stun armor power pack recharging station, a polished rosewood entertainment center with several shelves surrounding a large central video screen, a cherry wood coffee table, a dark blue suede sofa, and a metallic red starship simulator here.

13:39 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

13:39 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

13:39 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

13:39 You begin the launch sequence.

13:39 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

13:39 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

13:41 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

13:41 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

13:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock at this privately owned and operated space station."

13:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:41 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

13:41 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

15:08 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

15:08 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

15:08 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

15:08 The computer announces, "Three planets have been detected in the sector."

15:08 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

15:09 You begin the landing sequence.

15:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a moon.
The sounds of the relativity drive slowly cease as the starship comes to a halt.

15:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the moon's surface.

15:11 You pull a small lever toward yourself, deactivating the ship's systems.

15:11 You suddenly become aware of a decrease in noise as the ship's systems shut down, leaving you in complete silence.

15:11 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Saturn to Harboria flight control, there's a battle going on up there!"

15:13 From a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it, you hear a blue flight control scanner announce, "Flight control in Harboria, a ship is firing weapons here."

15:19 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (indoors) (buckled into a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Lobbius; Landing Area.

15:32 [Lobbius; Landing Area]
This small landing area appears to be setup just outside a massive crater. The ground surrounding the metal landing platform is bare brown rock which has several deep gouges in it. A metal fence rings the perimeter of a truly massive crater which spreads into the distance for as far as the eye can see to the north and east. A gate leading into the site bears a sign reading, Pilots only. To the west, a thin forest struggles to grow amid the barren landscape.

15:40 Last ten announcements:
[06/29/17 - 4:15 p.m.] Announcement: This is the final call for host applicants. We're looking for builders, event planners and programmers. If you think you've got what it takes, be sure to submit your application by Friday, June 30 by no later than 12 noon CDT. See message board post 87729 for requirements and instructions. As always, if you have questions, feel free to assist.
[07/01/17 - 1:14 p.m.] Announcement: A friendly warning that blowing up starships or otherwise taking advantage of circumstances presented to you by a server crash is heavily frowned upon. If people don't have a chance to reawaken and move themselves to somewhere safe, please do not destroy or steal their property. Typically, you should give someone at least an 8 to 12 hour window due to timezone differences to reconnect and move themselves to safety. Any instances of this happening will result in any in character gains being reversed, as well as the property restored to the victim. Thank you.
[07/01/17 - 1:17 p.m.] Announcement: And on the subject of server crashes, there was a minor rollback last night. If you lost any progress, please feel free to ASSIST to get it restored. I predict the issue causing panics will not occur again, but you never know!
[07/03/17 - 3:50 p.m.] Announcement: Hello everyone. I would primarily like to thank you all for participating in my first event! It was an overwhelming success (no one interject!) and I look forward to spicing up the Miriani plot. Myself, and perhaps a few friends will see you all July 5th.
[08/17/17 - 4:43 p.m.] Announcement: For those out of the loop, the Miriani fireside chat is now going on. To join, simply type @OOC. If you have no idea what this is, check OOC / announcements on your message board reader.
[08/30/17 - 3:19 a.m.] Announcement: Hello, night players! For really exciting maintenance reasons, we need to reboot the server. Please get to a safe location to avoid getting kidnapped and/or destroyed. Shutdown will be around 3:30 AM (8/30/17). Downtime isn't expected to last more than 10 minutes, but we could get really unlucky. Thanks for understanding!
[09/19/17 - 1:02 p.m.] Announcement: Happy Pirate Day! To celebrate this most auspicious occasion, we are digging up some treasure chests and littering them on various planets and space stations. These chests can contain anything from a rubber chicken to a trillion solid gold credits. You never know! To see who has the biggest booty, as it were, you can type: @TOP-PIRATES. Good luck!
[09/28/17 - 7:21 p.m.] Announcement: Sorry everybody, apparently I wrecked the dig site on Mercury. We're going to have to look at a backup to pull the artifact listing to get everything back to how it should be, which may be a while. So sorry for the inconvenience.
[09/29/17 - 3:39 p.m.] Announcement: The archaeology site on Mercury is back up and running. Huge thanks go 
15:40 out to Victor for hoarding logs like a winner.
[10/17/17 - 9:27 a.m.] Announcement: As a reminder, please, when submitting requests for children via the tradesman labs, include a surname for them. If none is provided, the request will be immediately denied.

16:28 You're already watching that.

16:28 For a top, you are wearing a gold vest with 'Force' embroidered on the left breast over a black cotton polo with thin white stripes. For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue jeans with the letter S stitched onto the back pocket in black thread over a pair of white cotton tapered boxers. You are wearing a pair of brown leather tennis shoes over a pair of white cotton athletic socks on your feet. You are wearing a thick black leather utility belt with several loops on it around your waist. You are also wearing a red communicator, a silver metafrequency lapel pin, a thick gold band set with a chunky emerald stone, a heavy titanium pocket watch with the image of an eagle etched onto its surface, a high-capacity transparent Lore computer, a black leather briefcase, a thin red leather messenger bag, a red archaeological artifact storage container, an asteroid hauling kit, a black rolled toolkit, a level five archaeological dig site scanner, a red spacesuit navigational computer, and a red spacesuit jet.

16:28 You are carrying nothing.

17:59 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

17:59 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

17:59 The computer announces, "Two planets and two space stations have been detected in the sector."

17:59 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

17:59 I don't understand that.

17:59 There are no ships here.

17:59 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

17:59 You sit down on a black suede captain's chair.

17:59 You pull a series of straps around yourself and securely buckle yourself into your seat.

17:59 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

18:00 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

18:00 The computer announces, "A planet and three space stations have been detected in the sector."

18:00 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

A solar battery has been mounted to the ceiling which is set with a row of lights giving off a dim yellow illumination. A few broken mining axes lie in the far corner. A battered metal table leans against one wall, its two broken legs lying on the floor beside it. A large doorway leads to the northeast and a short set of metal steps leads down into semi-darkness.

On the southeastern quadrant of the field is a small hut with a barely operational airlock leading deep into the planet.
