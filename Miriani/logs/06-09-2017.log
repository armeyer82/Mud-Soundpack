12:30 ["Dolphin" Control Room]
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, a stun armor power pack recharging station, and Jenaia the droid here.
You can go south and out.

12:31 You peer out and see...
[Alliance High Guard Command; Garage]
This cavernous starship garage echoes with the sound of metal upon metal as starships are constantly transported to and from one of the four docking bays. Narrow metal staircases wend their way up the sides of the dome to catwalks which provide access to those starships kept in long-term storage near the ceiling. Recharging platforms create a maze of twisting pathways and dead end corridors throughout the garage, and silvery drones rush around tending to the various spacecraft. Four wide archways provide access to the promenades on this level, and at the center of the room, a small carpeted platform leads down to the main level of the spaceport.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You see a glowing blue security drone, a glowing blue medical drone, Joanna the droid, Ophelia the droid, Muzano the droid, Ralf the droid, Rika the droid, Aria the droid, a glossy red security drone, a glossy green security drone, a slim violet security drone, a slim red medical drone, Eek the droid, Koko the droid, Cassie the droid, a gleaming violet medical drone, Whistle the droid, Austin the droid, Jackson the droid, Puff the droid, Daisy the droid, Avya the droid, Jada the droid, Slink the droid, VanPersie the droid, Lawrence the droid, Safe the droid, Rocky the droid, Serlo the droid, Ponyo the droid, Joee the droid, Fatso the droid, Suckasaurus the droid, two turquoise security drones, Blossom t

A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls.

[Acrylon Spaceport; Landing Hub]
This massive landing pad is covered by a truly enormous transparent dome. Circular openings in the ceiling shielded by shimmering forcefields allow the heavy starship traffic to move efficiently into and out of the area. Situated at the heart of the spaceport, the landing hub is surrounded by wide corridors which branch out in a star formation towards a variety of facilities. The granite floor has been bleached to an off-white by the Sun.

Situated on the top level of one of the circular spaceport structures floating high above the Venusian surface, this busy landing pad is the central point for the city's primary unit. The floor is comprised of a highly reflective metallic material with low steel platforms housing a series of landed starships. Off to the side, a bright blue pair of double doors has been labeled as the starship garage. Through an enormous bay beside them, a pair of robotic arms extends, ready to transport starships to and from the crowded landing pad. Through nearly a dozen archways surrounding this cavernous space, wide corridors lead deeper into the city itself. A pair of wide metal steps leads up from the western edge of the landing pad and up through the ceiling which has been painted with a realistic representation of the Solar System.

The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The noise of several components working together creates a barely noticeable hum in the background. The overhead fluorescent lights are casting a white light throughout the room. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Alliance High Guard Command; Docking Bay Beta.

21:27 [Newbie] Anton Navarro: In what context?

21:27 [Newbie] Noah Navarro: Type notifications.

21:27 [Newbie] Amy Draksen: You need the GMU upgrade, then to use the notification options.

21:27 [Newbie] Daryk Karlsen: Letting me know if there are asteroids, stars, artifacts, etc.

21:27 [Newbie] Anton Navarro: O as they said, you need GMU. Then play with notifications.

21:27 The ship must be powered before you can do that.

21:27 You push a small lever away from you, activating the ship's systems.

21:27 You notice a faint hum begin to emanate from nowhere in particular as the starship's systems begin to power up.

21:27 The computer announces, "The subwarp drive has completed its charging cycle."

21:27 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Leeann, are you still available to pick stuff up?"

21:27 [Newbie] Daryk Karlsen: Perfect. Thanks.

21:28 [General Communication] Leeann Blade transmits, "Yes."

21:28 [General Communication] Noah Navarro transmits, "Do you have a key to Bradley's BC?"

21:28 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

21:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Dolphin, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safe."

21:28 The sound of the relativity drive echoes through the room as it propels the ship towards space.

21:28 [General Communication] Bradley Kind transmits, "I will give her one to bring you."

21:28 The ship is already moving.

21:28 The sounds of the relativity drive calm as the starship completes its final maneuver into space.

21:28 You hear a low rumbling sound as the wormhole drive opens a wormhole.

21:28 The starship vibrates violently as it nears the wormhole's event horizon.

21:28 A bright flash of blue light floods the room as the starship travels through the wormhole.

21:28 There is nothing to see.

21:28 The bright light vanishes as the starship emerges at the other side of the wormhole.

21:28 The computer announces, "Subwarp drive locked on coordinates 10, 12, 8."

21:28 You hear a deep hum as the starship begins an intrasector subwarp.

21:28 The starship begins vibrating violently as the hum picks up in intensity.

21:28 The vibration diminishes as the starship completes its subwarp.

21:28 The ship is as close to those coordinates as autopilot can take it.

21:28 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

21:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Dolphin. We read your AIE transponder. You are cleared to dock."

21:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

This small shop has been designed to resemble the interior of a starship's airlock. Soothing music filters in from unseen speakers in the ceiling, showing off one of the upgrades offered here. Posters have been plastered to the walls, each of them advertising the various upgrades available for purchase. A pair of sales droids dressed in white uniforms stroll around the store chatting with customers, and each time a purchase is made, a team of drones appear carrying the required equipment for installation.

22:06 ["Dolphin" Control Room] (sitting on a black suede captain's chair)
The control room of a starship is much more spacious than one might previously have supposed, though it is not massive by any means. The wall at the front of the room is dominated by the starmap viewer. Rows of consoles line the rest of the walls, each containing an array of touchscreens, switches, and buttons that are used to control the starship's various systems with some degree of redundancy. The usual humming of the ship's components has been silenced by the lack of power, resulting in an unusual void of background noise. Beneath your feet, covering the expanse of the room, is a plush white carpet. There appears to be no power in this room. The overhead lights glow faintly, hardly enough to do anything but avoid large obstacles. Looking through the window, you see the ship is at Acrylon Spaceport; Garage.
You see an internal stun turret, a black suede captain's chair, a black suede co-captain's chair, a cherry wood coffee table, a black leather sofa, a gleaming red security drone, a shiny white starship simulator, a bright red cooler, and a stun armor power pack recharging station here.
You can go south and out.

22:06 You peer out and see...

22:06 [Acrylon Spaceport; Garage]
The reinforced granite floor of this truly cavernous garage has been painted a pale brick red. A tall metal gate cordons off most of the garage, leaving a path ten feet wide between the starship recharging platforms on either side. Several pairs of robotic arms constantly raise and lower ships to and from the landing pad, and the noise of metal on metal combined with the loud hum of the robotic motors echoes off the walls. A curving staircase leads down from the landing pad above, ending at the back of the garage where three wide archways lead into well-lit facilities. An elegant carved doorway inlaid with delicate gold scrollwork leads into a wide corridor beyond.
You see a group of unpowered ships here.
You can go north, southeast, south, southwest, and up.

Firstly, we are detecting an inordinately sized fleet of Praelor ships, yet again on a direct route for Sector 32. It's unclear whether they may make a detour. Our reconnaissance is reporting as the situation updates. It may be hours until they reach our local sectors, and I have several captains actively pursuing and attempting to waylay them, which means they may not arrive at all. Please be on your guard, however. Secondly, we have been continuously working to deter the effect of the Kritzn. I cannot give much more than that, but the information regarding what we're working on will become declassified as of next week and we will brief you as circumstances dictate. Finally, I've received word about what a phenomenal job everyone has been doing on restoring the Hale's catapult. I'm sure The Hale Collective government is very thankful for your contributions and will acknowledge you accordingly when everything is said and done. Good luck!"
