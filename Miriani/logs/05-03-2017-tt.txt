tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips
and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than
average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and
understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally
part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows,
her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight
hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.

jeans. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around
her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten

Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct
source, woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across
everything. The walls of the starship are obscured by the curtains of
silk, a twisting infinity of webs draped over rock visible through the
windows. The air is cool and moist, smelling of rock and decay. The
silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust of wind or the sound of
numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights overhead indicate
that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see

just thought none of this applied to me."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Gun."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while
on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long
counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks
have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to
the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that
the ship is in a garage.
