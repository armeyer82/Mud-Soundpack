Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport

You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a small seashell pink
trash can, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a glossy
sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a set of lavender
silk sheets, a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a
turquoise rattan dresser with brass handles and a glass-covered top, and a high

A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.
[General Communication] Sakura Arakida transmits, "It's not like burping,
beltching or farting over your communicator. Or worse, puking."
[General Communication] Zandria Marschaund transmits, "Really."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Thanks for that well-researched
statement Sakura."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I'm afraid to ask."

[General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.
'wow, that got out of hand quickly.
You say, "Wow, that got out of hand quickly."

to be before doing that?"

sectional sofa with Jewel the sleeping large violet glowing felo on it, an
antique oak table from Old Earth, a small purple trash bin, a textured plasteel
floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a dusky pink
rattan cabinet, a glossy pale pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling
coral pink-lit aquarium containing blue and yellow aquatic life and multicolored
round rocks, a small bubbling neon blue-lit toroidal aquarium containing blue
and red aquatic life and round rocks, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit

[Starship "William Dove"; Shower]
You can go out.
l
[Starship "William Dove"; Shower]
This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small
sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some
effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be
completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several
grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. The status
lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You can go out.
[General Communication] Paisley Jensen transmits, "I mean, when hungover, I'm
more likely to fling the communicator against the wall than I am to push a
button and possibly let you all be my collective porcelain god."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle snickers.

Chainguns are components one does not often expect to find on an AEU ship. They
don't hurt the combat grid too badly, and some of them have higher hull bonuses
than any other weapons, but they do have their downsides. Chainguns require
ammunition, and time to reload when the turrets run dry. This will mean you
cannot fire for a certain period of time. Also, without bonuses they do not hit
as hard as the other weapons available to us which means you will likely be
stuck in a battle for a longer time than you might want.

Rental ships:
As cadets or new pilots, it can be tough getting yourselves assigned to crewed
beacons. You should still try to do so as flying successfully against Outsiders
is not an easy thing without considerable practice. However, if you feel
yourself capable, you can rent one of these ships. You should note however, that
if you get any of these ships destroyed, your rent prices will increase
considerably based on the number of destroyed rental ships you have. Rental
ships all have mid-level upgrades, and most are not as strong as ships that you
can actually purchase yourself. You can try them out by going to Agnarr's
Interstellar Siege Force Rental-in-a-Box in Tannhauser Gate.

Long-term rentals:
The fighter and heavy bomber listed in this section are generally similar to the
ones rented at Tannhauser, save for the fact that I'm pretty sure they start out
with stock upgrades and have to be upgraded by the long-term renter. The modular
tactical platform and the Modular Terrorerotici both can only have
corporation-based fighters such as the hyperion ships or the ones rented either
short-term or long-term by Agnar attached to them as far as we've deduced, as
well as the shuttles manufactured by corporations such as Hermes or United. You
can attach the ships to the platforms only from space. Note: the docking bay
size of the tactical platform and the Terrorerotici will increase depending on
the types of ships you have attached to them.

If you want to own a six-person ship to do stuff in and don't quite qualify for

to perform well enough in a fight with decent upgrades. It does however require
you to fill out an application, and approval or denial notifications may take
some time to reach you, but you'll be notified by mail regardless.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Good day AEU, We are currently seeking
someone to fill the vacant AEU Ground Squad Leader's position. Although it would
be ideal that someone with advanced-level skills in Ground Combat would assume
this role, since we currently do not have any Cadets or new pilots to instruct,
anyone with Ground Combat knowledge and whom is willing to grow their skills
should at least give consideration to this opportunity. The paperwork is minimal
as well. If you would like to volunteer for the position of Ground Squad Leader,
please notify me in writing and I will submit your name for consideration. -

[Starship "Guinea Pig"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers" here.
You can go down and out.

Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate

Chainguns are components one does not often expect to find on an AEU ship. They
don't hurt the combat grid too badly, and some of them have higher hull bonuses
than any other weapons, but they do have their downsides. Chainguns require
ammunition, and time to reload when the turrets run dry. This will mean you
cannot fire for a certain period of time. Also, without bonuses they do not hit
as hard as the other weapons available to us which means you will likely be
stuck in a battle for a longer time than you might want.

[Starship "Revenge"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a gray leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

move
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The starship is already moving.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

A patrol recently ran into a bunch of IFS ships near Beacon A-45.
The fighting's done, but the people in R&D think there might be something to
salvage from the wrecks.
Head out there and pick up 80,000 units from the wrecks and we'll see what we've
got.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
TxMds_-o6|-1reZS(@~z{`}C0YpdmpGql~vru9.%
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
<*k_V%/W]TM-6<B)zr/k8BrId=cMAg)<B[Pcg#?|
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of
tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead
and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy.
Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental
suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling
units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in
powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and
intense ground combat.

You stand at the entrance to a subterranean tunnel. The radiation level is
somewhat reduced here. Deeper in the tunnel, you can expect to find mineral
deposits and perhaps one or two alien artifacts, from whichever species occupied
this world before humanity established a presence. Markings on the ground show
that this area has already been explored.

[Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
.e|UFZ1IY}eT!bXmfhvK<U\Tvy~]b:KlB;YBQRZK
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

an EAOS Alchemist
This is a slim, almost delicate-looking battlesuit, painted dark silver all
over. It resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A slim cockpit encases the
pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a framework of
hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A large plasma cannon is
mounted to the left forearm, a neutronium-laced metal tube leading to a large
tank on the back of the suit. A laser attachment is mounted to the right wrist.
A large subsonic projector is mounted to the left shoulder.
It appears to be 0% damaged.
You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."
You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires

You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a

the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!

resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A slim cockpit encases the pilot's
torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a framework of hydraulics and
cables with some protective plating. A minidrone applicator is attached to the

[Starship "Daisy May"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.
You see a temporary wormhole drive, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding
trough, a hefty green twin tailed felo, and a large octarine soldier felo kitten
here.

they're both almost dead."

will work."

gotta shoot the same one again, ta keep the damage even. First time we tried
this one was a lot more damaged than the other one."

[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple
cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a glossy gold
ceramic felo chow bowl, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored

Damien Alexander
He appears to be 32 years old. He is about six feet and one inch tall and has
tan skin. His body is athletic with average-shaped hips and well-muscled calves.
He has sloping shoulders and an averagely built chest. His face is narrow and
subtly asymmetrical, with a sharp nose and strong chin. His lips are thin and
beige and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set
of dark eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and average-shaped. His ear-length,
straight hair is gold with dark metallic purple highlights and mostly unkempt
but standing on end down the middle in a faux hawk. He also has gold stubble. He
has oval clear fingernails. He has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging
from a length of braided ash brown leather in his hair.
A small enameled crimson fist pierces his left earlobe, a small enameled mystic
purple skull pierces his right earlobe, an old titanium ring engraved with a row
of tiny chainguns pierces his right upper ear, and a thick stainless steel ring
with a dolphin charm pierces his left upper ear.
 He is wearing a black flame print bowling shirt, a pair of loose-fitting faded
blue jean cut-offs, and a pair of indigo canvas sneakers. He is also wearing a
wrist-mounted chronometer, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
his wrist, an indigo slider einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid
silver ring engraved with dolphins, a vibro-baton, and a gunmetal gray canvas
messenger bag. His head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, both hands, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sleeveless pastel purple cotton top with a three-button front
and v-neck trimmed with tiny embroidered flowers, a pair of lowrise white capri
pants, and a pair of strappy white leather sandals. She is also wearing an
orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of
tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone
in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a neon pink vibro-baton,
and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face,
both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, and
both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying Xavier the big silver soldier felo in her right hand.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

sapphire star quilt on it, a small white trash bin, a round white rattan coffee
table with a glass top, a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized

blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean

around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple

[Starship "Guinea Pig"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers" here.
You can go down and out.

[Pilot Organization Level; Organization Center]
This room appears to be filled with friendship and camaraderie. Pilots
frequently come together in pairs and exchange firm handshakes. Others form
whole groups and cheer each other on, slapping each other on the back. A line of
terminals along one wall allow other pilots to join in on the action.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

A large cradle slides up from beneath and stops, displaying itself in the center
of the room. Upon it is a clear oval-shaped shell, which contains an alien plant
with yellow veins.
This is a faintly pulsing stalk with thick yellow veins. The plant's primary
color is silver with a sheen of deep purple, faintly reflective, reminiscent of
metal.
The plant has grown to fill its container.

A large cradle slides up from beneath and stops, displaying itself in the center
of the room. Upon it is a clear oval-shaped shell, which contains an alien plant
with purple flowers.
This is a thick spiraling stalk with small, pale purple flowers. The plant's
primary color is silver with a sheen of deep purple, faintly reflective,
reminiscent of metal.
Though not near fully grown, the plant looks to have established itself.

This is an orbital marketplace, connected to others like it through a series of
wormhole shunts. These same wormholes are the reason such marketplaces are not
allowed to operate on planets or large space stations. A computer interface
provides access to buying and selling on the marketplace, and a large chute
underneath it allows items to emerge as they are delivered via wormhole.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The motion of the ship throws your body from side to side, but your seatbelt
holds you in place.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Davion James"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

large circular opening in the walkway allows one to look down on the center of
the spaceport below. Even though hallways to the east and west are still blocked
off by barriers because of continuing construction there, a scattering of lush
ferns and an arrangement of a comfortably padded couch and armchair upholstered
in silver gray leather, with a polished Velourian oak table between them,
invites one to linger. Near the escalator is a small souvenir store, its
entrance decorated with an arch of fancy wrought iron.

billion depending on rarity."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alas, this new plant will only
really be worthwhile on geminis and void piercers, but it will give them great
speeds."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, to anyone with a lab
those cuttings that are not neutered are worth heaps. I was not looking to buy
anything though. Just curious."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And why only geminis and void
piercers?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Very few ships would do with a
max velocity increase. There are more useful plants for them, to be honest."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Most people tend to do most of
their artifacting though, in things like geminis and void piercers."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean I suppose the alliance
tier 1 scouts might want those plants too, but well."
[General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Thanks for clarifying that."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, you're usually not going
to use max velocity for anything other than artifacting."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Unfortunately, asteroid hauling
doesn't take it into account."

[Starship "Shooting Star"; Control Capsule]
This small capsule is only large enough for one person. A single flight seat
molds itself to the form of its occupant, helping to ease the burden of
acceleration along with a rather underpowered artificial gravity dampening
system. The capsule's inner workings extend into the flight cabin, with the
starship's main computer right up against the back of the seat. A rather sparse
flight control board is presented claustrophobically close to the pilot's face.
It seems to lack any sort of manual control, allowing only automatic flight
profiles to be entered into an antiquated flight computer. It does, however,
possess controls to operate a single small turret. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad. The hatch appears to be locked.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.

attempt to make contact. As a last resort, I would send out an active ping, but
since it can be extremely dangerous to do so, I would only do so if I had no
other choice.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Star Conquest Help: Metachannel Communicators
--
Category: Communication
--
Each character starts the game possessing a metachannel FTL communicator. This
allows people to transmit on the set of channels viewable only by their alliance
as well as the Tactical and General channels, open to all alliances. Also, the
Newbie channel is available through this device.
To use them, the following commands are used.  (Please note that you must be
wearing the communicator and it must be on.  It must also be YOUR communicator. 
Do not give your communicator to another player, or swap it.  This will stop the
communicators working, as they are assigned to the person in question both ICly
and OOCly.)
To turn the communicator on and off completely, the command TURN COMM is used.
To turn the Newbie channel on or off, NEWB COMM is used.
To turn the General channel on and off, GEN COMM is used.
To turn the Tactical channel on and off, TAC COMM is used.
To transmit on the Newbie channel, use the command TRANSMIT NEWBIE message (this
can be shortened to TRA NEWB message)
Example: TRA NEWB How do I communicate with people?
Result: [Newbie Help] Cameron Jellas transmits, "How do I communicate with
people?"
To transmit on the General channel, use the command TRANSMIT GENERAL message 
(this can be shortened to TRA GEN message)
Example: TRA GEN Hello.
Result: [General Communication] Darla Kinnington transmits, "Hello."
To transmit on the Tactical channel, use the command TRANSMIT TACTICAL message
(this can be shortened to TRA TAC message)
Example: TRA TAC There are Battle Thralls in sector 26!
Result: [Tactical Communication] Ella Lerini transmits, "There are Battle
Thralls in sector 26!"
The channels specific to your alliance are slightly different.
You can TUNE COMM TO NUMBER, where NUMBER is a channel number from 1 to 10, to
transmit on that channel using the command TRA message.
Example: TUNE COMM TO 1
Result: You tune a metachannel communicator to ALLIANCE | Channel 1.
Example: TRA Hello.
Result: [ALLIANCE | Channel 1] Faye Masters transmits, "Hello."
You can also TUNE COMM TO 0 (the number zero) which puts the communicator in
tuner mode, allowing you to hear transmissions on all of your alliance channels.
 However, this means that the command to transmit to those channels is slightly
different.  Since the comm is no longer tuned to a specific channel, you must
specify the particular channel number you wish to transmit to.
Example: TUNE COMM TO 0
Result: You tune a metachannel communicator to the ALLIANCE tuner.
Example: TRA 1 Hello.
Result: [ALLIANCE | Channel 1] Georgina Norrington transmits, "Hello."
You can also use social commands with your communicator by simply transmitting
the command, or emotes by transmitting a normal emote command.
Example: TRA GEN laugh

Star Conquest Help: Channels

The pilot leagues each have access to several specific FTL communication
channels for their alliances, in addition to generic interalliance channels that
can be used by all.
The currently available channels open to all alliances are:
GENERAL COMMUNICATION
'TRA GEN [message]'
The primary interalliance channel, usable by any pilot from any alliance, as
well as certain elements of alliance governments.
TACTICAL COMMUNICATION
'TRA TAC [message]'
An encrypted channel again usable by any pilot from any alliance, this channel
tends to be used to give invasion warnings, reports of unusual events, and
discussions of a nature that should not be made public by the leagues.
NEWBIE HELP
'TRA NEW [message]'
A vaguely OOC channel that exists only to allow new players to ask questions
they could not otherwise ask on other channels due to the OOC nature of them,
such as how to do things that ICly the character should know.
The currently available channels specific to alliances are listed below.  To
transmit on a channel, either tune your communicator to a specific channel (such
as TUNE COMM TO 1, to tune it to Alliance Communication, and use TRA [message]
to speak on it, or TUNE COMM TO 0 to set your comm to the tuner, and use TRA 1
[message] for Alliance Communication, TRA 2 [message] for Distress, etc.)
CHANNEL 1 = ALLIANCE COMMUNICATION
This is the primary alliance-specific channel, used by most pilots to speak with
other members of their alliance's pilot league.
CHANNEL 2 = TACTICAL
This channel is, as the name implies, for tactical discussion, emergency
responses and so on.
CHANNEL 3 = TRADE INFORMATION
This channel is for trade-related discussion or requests.
CHANNEL 4 = SECTOR STATUS
This channel is for information relating to the status of all sectors controlled
by your alliance.
CHANNEL 9 = RADIO CHANNELS
These channels, slightly different for each alliance, are radio channels,
specific to each alliance.
CHANNEL 10 = CONQUEST STATUS
This channel is used to periodically determine the alliance's current Conquest
status.
Channels 5, 6, 7 and 8 are currently not used for specific purposes, but are
usable as if they are normal channels.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.
You see an overstuffed red chair, an improved temporary wormhole drive, and Lily
Kaise's workbench here.

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Demarco Scott
He appears to be 29 years old. He is about six feet and six inches tall and has
fair skin. His body is full-figured with muscled hips and well-muscled calves.
He has rounded shoulders and an averagely built chest. His face is round and
unblemished, with an average nose and long chin. His lips are full and

eyebrows, his eyes are blue and round. His chin-length, straight hair is blonde
and unstyled. He also has a chest-length platinum blonde unstyled beard.
 He is wearing a snug long-sleeved dark purple pullover shirt of heavy cotton
with pockets on the upper arms and steel-eyelet webbing across the chest and a
pair of low rise black cotton cargo pants with a lot of pockets and loosened
straps on the outside of each leg. He is also wearing a message board reader, a
portable newsfeed aggregator, an alliance information assistant, a personal
filing computer, a standard starship flightbag, a flight control scanner, a
metafrequency FTL transmitter, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, a
hand-made bracelet of tiny pinecones and polished coffee beans, a charcoal gray

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a sleeveless buttercup yellow cotton top with a v-neck and a row
of tiny embroidered flowers at the edges, a pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans
with a small dark red 'XX' embroidered on the left front pocket, and a pair of
shiny buttercup yellow patent leather clogs. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a neon pink vibro-baton, and a
soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise
Vineyards Pinot Grigio in her right hand.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Akira Kazama transmits, "Why the sigh?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Because it took
me hours to salvage when it takes some only twenty minutes. How the hell do they
do it so fast?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Akira Kazama transmits, "What were you
salvaging?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ship recks."
[Notification from Starseekers] A load of salvage has been received at Fringe

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "What Grapple do you
have? If you have a Mighty, it can break-up chunks pretty fast. If you are using
a fine-tooth or otherwise, it will take longer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I have a mighty
three."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Then let's see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Akira Kazama transmits, "I think the main
reason why some can do it faster is because after a while you start getting a
feeling for a good angle to go in at, which means stuff comes out easier, which
means it breaks faster."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ah."

at the farthest meter and I first grapple at 45 and then if I don't find it
there or it's not 5 degrees higher or lower, I g to 70 and then to 20 and I
generally grapple a piece in 1 to 2 attempts per section."

Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oops I meant at 45 then
70, then 20."

around with that until you figure out what you like to do."

faster?"

meters long, I start from 10 and work my way down."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah!"
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:

45 and then 70 or so?"

exacts any more, been a while but once I do it again I might."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well I do those Accord
salvaging missions about once per conquest. They yield very high grade debris
chunks and you can get them done pretty fast and they also give good points.
Each mission pays me 20 million now plus whatever I get form the debris. I
generally do two full loads even though they only ask for 110k but it's high
grade so it's worth it and seems to help our goals a bit."

think it's time to."
Lily Kaise speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator:
