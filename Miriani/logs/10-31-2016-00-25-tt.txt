Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a
glass top, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker,
Meow the little calico CatBot, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium
containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named
Nellie, an insulated orange cooler, a small white trash bin, a compact red
refrigerator, a high tech silver star print holovid, a pocket-sized purple
holovid, a clear plastic food storage container, an insulated blue cooler, and
Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.

You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
launch
You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalliste, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

Introduction
 The galaxy is teeming with so many things to be collected, but how can
anyone be expected to know where to get it all?  Worry no more and let this
book help you fill your materialistic heart.
 This book will probably be missing stores, items, or just looks ugly.
If you know of anything I missed, or have any suggestions please drop me
a letter and I will consider any appropriate changes.
 Also note that most food and drinks have been omitted from this book.
I'm saving those for my Food and Restaurant guide, whenever I get around
to writing it.
How to Use This Book
 Simply look through the index for the item you're looking for and turn to
its respective page for a list of all the shops that sell that item.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully
charged.

l supernova
the eight-person soothsayer mark two "Supernova"
You see a cruiser here.
"Supernova" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AH-12b" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. The bays of its minicannon
launchers are somewhat scuffed and painted silver. Its landing struts are clean
and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a silver AEU logo forward on the starboard side, a geodesic radome, a
smooth dome, and a single large port covered by an iris-style hatch on the
forward end, and the hull has an odd sheen to it, as if covered in a thin
gossamer webbing.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive and an overstuffed red chair here.

Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.
Nicolette says to Morris, "I think his master called."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "This time, the djinn was the one that was
pleasing to be let back out, so they made a bargain that the ifrit would help
the fisherman in return for being released. Now, djinn are very famous for being
able to grant any wish you could want, if they so desire. So from then on the
fisherman always caught very fancy exotic fish, which the djinn then told him to
give to the Sultan."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "You can't find any asteroids
if you went out of second battle?"
Morris bows his head and smirks.

Morris Corlew speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator and
watch:
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Alko, you have to be in an
asteroid field or perhaps an oort to find asteroids..."
Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "We
are telling stories, come."
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "They were magic fish, and he got a lot of
money. Everytime a fish was fried, a person would appear to ask the fish a
question and the fish would answer it. The Sultan was all very impressed by this
and went to visit the fisherman."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Well, am trying to find an
asteroid where I can land and power down my ship, and continue tomorrow."

[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Why do you wanna do that?"
Soraya Rhyz says in a Luna accent, "He and the fisherman became friends, thanks
to the help of the djinn, and the fisherman was made the Sultan's treasurer and
the Sultan married his daughter. The end, which is kind of lame, but so it
goes."
Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Irrelevant. You can't do that.

Lillian Hudson takes a sip from an used-looking mason jar of Sugar Whiskey.
Morris Corlew speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator and
watch:
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "072, Alko."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "So, I grew up in the north of the
North American continent on Old Earth. There's a lot of woodland and forests
there, and my family went on plenty of camping trips. This is a story someone
told me as a little girl on a trip."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok, I'll do that."
Aisling the Fox nods.
Morris Corlew nods to Lillian Hudson.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Now, what you have to understand
about that part of the planet. This time of year, it's already much darker than
what the rest of the planet is used to. In the winter, especially near the
solstice, we only get a couple hours of daylight each day."
Small glowing embers from the bonfire float up into the sky.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Cold, too."
Morris Corlew shivers.
Lillian Hudson nods to Morris Corlew. "Yeah, it gets pretty cold pretty easily."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys du Nouveau Quebec says in a Frenchified Rimward
accent, "So dark."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Anyway, this guy speaks of a ghost
who hides in the forest, praying on injured or dying animals, and then taking
over their forms to lure humans into it cluthces."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Cluthces."
Morris looks up toward the sky and the tree canopy above.
Lillian Hudson takes a sip from an used-looking mason jar of Sugar Whiskey.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "And it was scary enough, but I
didn't believe him."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "So, the next day, I went out
looking around the campsite. There were the usual animals. Rabbits, birds,
whatever."
Lillian Hudson gestures vaguely.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Nothing dying though."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "But, while I was out, the sun
started to set. And what's worse, I'd lost track of precisely where I was. I
thought I knew how to get back, so I started off hiking."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Oh dear."
Lillian Hudson nods.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Not good. Done that before."
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Sunset comes fast once it starts,
so by the time I noticed, it was only a few minutes until full dark settled in."
Melinda Grins and kisses Lillian on the nose. "Perfect story. I can picture you
so getting lost."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "And, wandering through the woods, I
heard a howl."
A whispering melody carried on a gentle wind fills your ears, and then it is
gone.
Morris tips his head to the side and listens carefully.
Lillian smiles whistfully at the song floating on the breeze, then seems to
shake herself and continues.
A Tardick lizard named Isis flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lillian
Hudson's shoulder.
Akemi Bando shakily shuffles in from the north.
Aisling the Fox waves to Akemi Bando.
Akemi Bando waves.
Morris Corlew glances at Akemi Bando and nods.
Lily Kaise waves to Akemi Bando.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "So, I freeze and try to figure out
where it's coming from. Silence. Nothing but the wind in the trees. And the
darkness."
Akemi Bando sits down on a gray wool blanket.
Akemi Bando hefts a makeshift cane made out of scrap metal and hook it over her
arm, so as to avoid misplacing it while her hands are otherwise occupied.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "And then, out of the silence,
another howl pierces the night."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda
Michaels's shoulder.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "And another."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "And another."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "I count eight in all, and then I
see eyes."
Lily winces.
Morris's eyes widen.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Glowing golden eyes, as high as a
man's chest."
Morris Corlew shudders.
Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings.
eta
I don't understand that.
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "They say the forest has eyes,
but..."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "But that's all I see. I make it to
a clearing, the eyes following me, but staying beneath the trees. And, of
course, as I approach the other side of the clearing, I see more eyes. I had
just enough time to see five more pairs when..."
Melinda Michaels nods to Akemi Bando.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "A squirrel lands smack dab in the
middle of the clearing, as if it had been thrown from a tree."
Melinda Michaels laughs and applauds sedately.

You gasp.
Lillian says to Melinda in an Old Earth accent, "Hush."
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Wow."
Lillian Hudson grins.
Lily Kaise asks in a New Earth accent, "Woo a flying squirrel?"
Morris Corlew says in an Appalachian accent, "Or a thrown squirrel."

mangled, all twisted."
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Oh oh."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "A broken squirrel. An injured
squirrel."
'poor squirrel
You say, "Poor squirrel."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Darn."
Lily looks sad and says 'aww.
Lillian Hudson asks in an Old Earth accent, "As irrational as it was, I suddenly
had this overwhelming urge to protect that squirrel. Get it away from the wolves
that were surrounding us. Because those were wolves, right? What else has eyes
like that and howls?"
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "But it didn't matter."
nod lillian
You nod to Lillian Hudson.
Lily Kaise nods.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "That squirrel, that poor, broken
squirrel... All alone in the cold and dark, all tangled and barely able to
move..."
Melinda Michaels frowns.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "So I approach the squirrel."
Morris Corlew frowns and glances at Lillian Hudson.
Ather Jammoa takes a sip from an used-looking mason jar of Apple Pie City Gin.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "It was like the wolves that were
chasing me didn't exist anymore."
Ather Jammoa takes a sip from an used-looking mason jar of Apple Pie City Gin.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "As I'm about to touch it, out of
the corner of my eye, I see a blur moving towards me. Just centimeters away from
the squirrel, I hear a vicious snarl and something slams into me from the right,
knocking me to the ground."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "I struggle to get my hands and
knees under me, to stand. But what feels like a paw presses me to the ground
again."
Akemi Bando examines an oblong copper still standing on a faded wooden pedestal
for a moment.
Melinda Michaels asks in a Bedford accent, "Bad wolfie?"
Akemi Bando helps herself to a closed used-looking mason jar of Sugar Whiskey.

right in front of me. It stares into my eyes..."
Akemi Bando opens an used-looking mason jar of Sugar Whiskey.

You wave to Akemi Bando.
Akemi Bando takes a sip from an used-looking mason jar of Sugar Whiskey.
Akemi Bando nods.
Lillian Hudson asks in an Old Earth accent, "And another snarl, this one from
behind me. Then, a tree limb cracks above me. Weren't the trees back at the
edges of the clearing?"
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Then, as I look up into another
pair of golden eyes, I realize two things."
Morris says to Lillian, "Hopefully one is that you were actually dreaming..."
Melinda Michaels grins.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "I see where this is going."
Aisling the Fox absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "In the split second before
everything goes black, I notice the squirrel suddenly get up and scampter away,
legs working and as if they were never broken. And the eyes... The eyes were
just floating there... or maybe they were in a shadowy face... I couldn't tell."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "And then something hits me in the
back of the head and, next thing I know, I'm waking up in my sleeping bag, in my
tent, with my sister next to me."
Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.
Melinda Michaels laughs.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "And yeah, I thought maybe it was a
crazy dream."
Lily Kaise grins at Lillian Hudson.
'Wow, scary dream.
You say, "Wow, scary dream."
Aisling the Fox shakes her head.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "No."
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Nope."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Except my head... There was a lump
on the back of my head. I had a massive headache for the rest of the day, and
ever since that night, I've always bee fascinated by wolves. In fact, the first
thing I got as a pilot was my wolf keychain."
Lillian Hudson taps a gray wolf keychain.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Wolves protected her."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Was it real? I think so."

Lillian Hudson shrugs.

Melinda Michaels nods.
Morris turns to Lillian and claps excitedly.
Melinda Michaels says in a Bedford accent, "Because it was mangled then not."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Good story."
A Tardick lizard named Isis curls its tail loosely around Lillian Hudson's neck.
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "But if you're ever in the
wilderness in Alaska... Be ware of broken animal bodies. As cruel as this
sounds, don't try to help. You may not make it out of the forests."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Yeah."
Lillian Hudson looks at a Tardick lizard named Isis and smiles.
Melinda Michaels kisses Lillian Hudson on the lips.

and steal her eggs and eat them."
Lillian Hudson says in an Old Earth accent, "Oh oh, different fox magpie story."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "Needless to say, the magpie
hated the fox."
Lillian Hudson grins.
Keegan Wantz leans on Soraya Rhyz.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "One day, the fox comes to the
bush and sees the magpie in its nest, but the nest has no eggs."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, ""Oh, hello," said the fox. "It
is a fine day is it not?""
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, ""Yes, it is," said the
magpie."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, ""Oh, but I am so hungry. What
am I to do?" said the fox with a sly grin."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "The magpie knew the fox was
going to eat her. So she flew up high and spotted a girl carrying a basket full
of fish from a stream."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "She yelled down to the fox,
"Do not worry, fox, soon you will have more than enough to eat. Hide in the
bush.""
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "The girl carrying the basket
walked by, and the magpie flew into the basket and grabbed a bunch of fish, and
tossed them to the fox to eat."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "The fox ate so much, his belly
hung to the ground and he could hardly move. "Oh, I think I ate too much! I may
need help!" the fox cried."
Lillian Hudson giggles.
Soraya Rhyz wraps her arms around Keegan Wantz, pulling him close.
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "The magpie said, "Do not
worry, fox. I know a doctor." And the magpie flew off. When she was out of
earshot, she said quietly to herself, "But I am not bringing back medicine.""
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lillian Hudson cheers.

doctor. But she knew a man who owned hounds. She told the man of the fox lying
by the bush, and then flew back to the fox."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, ""Where is the doctor?" the fox
asked."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, ""No doctor, fox. But do not
worry, you will be out of your pain very soon," said the magpie."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "The fox's ears cocked, as he
heard the barking of the hounds approaching. "Dogs are coming!" he cried, but he
was too fat from eating to get up and run."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, ""Yes," said the magpie, as the
hounds rushed in."
Aisling the Fox says in an unusual Irish accent, "The fox tried his best to

You stand in a small clearing with with massive upright stones lining the

grow right up to the rocks and leafy green tree boughs extend overhead. Shadows

alive, while bright, green glowing fungi spot tree trunks and also form small
circles on the ground. A dark and overgrown path leads back to the pond to the

Star Conquest Help: Advanced Emoting
--
Category: Communication
--
This document describes the more advanced syntax of emoting, also known as
'posing.' Star Conquest provides many basic socials, such as 'nod' or 'laugh,'
but we also offer a rich emote system, where one can specify players and other
objects in the world directly, so that they will see 'you' instead of their
name.
For example, you could emote the following:
emote stares at ~kailyn for a moment before pointing a finger triumphantly in
the air.
:stares at ~kailyn for a moment before pointing a finger triumphantly in the
air.
Other players would see something like this:
Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein stares at Kailyn Sanas for a moment before
pointing a finger triumphantly in the air.
Kailyn, in this case would see:
Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein stares at you for a moment before pointing a
finger triumphantly in the air.
Additionally, you can passively emote, like so:
emote Suddenly, @ jumps into the air, cheering.
:Suddenly, @ jumps into the air, cheering.
Other players would see this:
Suddenly, Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein jumps into the air, cheering.
You can even combine the two, like so:
emote Bullets of sweat drip down @'s face while ~elena speaks.
:Bullets of sweat drip down @'s face while ~elena speaks.
Other players would see:
Bullets of sweat drip down Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein's face while Elena
Gibson speaks.
Additionally, one can use :: to eliminate the space after the emote, like so.
::'s metafrequency communicator warbles to life.
Everyone would then see:
Tyrant Overlord Sven Arghlestein's metafrequency communicator warbles to life.
You can use ~ multiple times in an emote, as well:
emote gesticulates wildly at ~jason, ~elena, and ~kailyn.
:gesticulates wildly at ~jason, ~elena, and ~kailyn.
The results of which is left as an exercise to the reader.
When you begin using emotes with more than just two people in the room, frequent
usages of ~person and ~person's or ~object can start to get a little old, as
well as sometimes confusing. To improve this, we've added pronoun modifiers.
Of the five modifiers, the three you'll most be using is .o, .p, and .q, running
off the same previous system of ~person, (tilde person), by adding .letter (dot
letter) to the end. This also works for object referral. Remember that you'll
always want to start an emote by referencing the person without a modifier, so
the room at large knows who you're emoting, because the modifiers will reduce
the others to only seeing 'her/him/its', and without the initial ~person they
won't know who is being emoted.
o for object pronoun. "Him, her, it," to others in the room and the person using
the emote. You to the person the emote is referencing. ~person.o. Emoter: (her)
Emoted (you) Third party (her)
p for possessive pronoun (adj). "His, her, its," to the room and person emoting,
your to the person referenced. ~person.p. Emoter: (his) Emoted (your) Third
party (his)
q for possessive pronoun (noun). "His, hers, its," to the room and the person
emoting, yours to the person referenced. ~person.q. Emoter: (her) Emoted (yours)
Third party (hers)
Example:
:emotes ~kailyn, swinging ~kailyn.o around by ~kailyn.p arm, his fingers twining
in ~kailyn.q.
The person sending the emote(Shadow here, but you normally), would see:
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow emotes Kailyn Sanas, swinging her around by her
arm, his fingers twining in hers.
And for the person being referenced (Kailyn) would see
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow emotes you, swinging you around by your arm,
his fingers twining in yours.
And the room at large would see
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow emotes Kailyn Sanas, swinging her around by her
arm, his fingers twining in hers.
Remember objects can be manipulated too, or even creative use on people.
:manipulates ~scanner to scan ~scan.r.
The person sending the emote would see:
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow manipulates a small hand scanner to scan
itself.
The hand scanner wouldn't see anything, because it's just a sad little hand
scanner. Poor thing. If it could see, it would be
Indulges in a spot of tea Shadow manipulates you to scan yourself.
Others in the room would see the same output as the emoter. Their output is
usually similar to the emoter, but there are times it will be slightly
different. Don't get discouraged, test it out for a better roleplaying
environment and a lot more fun socially!
Some clients may parse certain ascii keys in different ways, either needing an
extra tilde, comma, at sign, or colon. Experimentation with others is always
useful, pull someone you're comfortable with aside and have them show you their
side of the output, until you get the hang of it and know how things will look
for other people.
Full listing:
 Pronouns:
        .s => subject pronoun:          either `he',  `she', or `it'
        .o => object pronoun:           either `him', `her', or `it'
        .p => possessive pronoun (adj):  either `his', `her', or `its'
        .q => possessive pronoun (noun): either `his', `hers', or `its'
        .r => reflexive pronoun:  either `himself', `herself', or `itself'

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and
pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush
pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of
arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length,
straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls
down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a short lavender cotton tee with a glittery shooting star
printed on the front, a pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans with a small dark
red 'XX' embroidered on the left front pocket, and a pair of mystic purple suede
clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around
her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, and a soft

Thank you all for attending Oiche Shamhna and for sharing stories. At the very
end, a faerie spoke through the remaining people and told a story of its own. I
am sharing that story for you all as I remember it.
Long ago, in a place of beauty far from this false wood and dead world, was a
paradise.
But time is unkind, and as time's claws gripped tighter, the ruler of that place
had a vision.
They saw the future. Or, rather, they saw two possible futures.
In one future, they saw the end of everything. Nothing remained.
In the other, they saw desolation, darkness and hardship. The loss of perfection
and of innocence.
When they awoke, they knew they had to choose.
Knowing that mankind was on the rise, they made the only choice they could.
I hope I made the right one.

Aisling, I really had a good time. If the faeries could read our boards, I would
thank them in that way for the final story. I hope they know my heart, though.

[Hyperion; Spaceport Gate]
The Spaceport's walls rise around the port itself, casting shade over you. The
gate stands open, but an armed guard watches from his post just to the side of
it. To the south a long, thin road snakes away to the city whose rooftops you
can barely make out over the grass.

[Hyperion; Sea of Grass Road]
Gentle winds blow the high grasses back and forth, occasionally strongly enough
to push it into your path. The road is in obvious bad repair, but you don't pay
it much mind, keeping your eyes on the horizon. Faint sounds of animal life can
be heard over the wind. On the west side of the road the grass has been
trampled, and you can see a faint trail leading from here through the grassy
countryside. In addition, a bright red and white sign on the other side of the
road points the way down a clear path to the Felo Sanctuary to the east.

The trail comes to an end here in the remains of an old homestead. Except for a
broken concrete foundation nearly hidden in the grass, nothing is left of it.

a faint path toward the southeast where the grass has been recently trampled.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

Thank you Aisling for a insightful and fun time. I do wish we would have waited

hauling with experienced people who don't know when to stop."

launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that
bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed
with bright white floodlights.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored
in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William
Dove! Welcome to home space!"
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.
You notice Lily Kaise using the radio to ask for landing clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU
transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "Guess i'll go look in the office and
check on felo."
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully
charged.
'Me too
You say, "Me too."
Lily Kaise says in a New Earth accent, "First I want to see if I can find
Sassie."
Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a
glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a round white rattan coffee table with a

green carpet, silvery white walls, and a modestly sized modern steel desk with
an ergonomically designed mesh and leather chair behind it. Arranged in front of
the desk are several other chairs, while ferns in white pots occupy the corners
of the office, and on the walls are framed images of sleek AEU starships. The
door is open.

here.
